00:07:18 Nutrition & Mental Health

checkout. now, discussion Dr. Chris Palmer. Chris, Dr. Palmer, thank
here. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot questions you. really excited topic
think people know mental illness is-- idea
is. people idea nutrition is. Fewer people certainly know
closely things can interact. think everybody familiar feeling
food ingestion food making feel good short term. eat
food tastes delicious us associate something nice, feel
good mentally physically. Whereas, eat something gives us food
poisoning maybe even something just doesn't taste great
associate bad experience, feel less good short term. believe
people understand familiar fact nutrition mental


health interact intimate, maybe even causal, way something
occurs long periods time. Meaning, ate yesterday day before,
maybe even 10 years ago, impacting way brain body
making feel now. would, love just tell us little bit
history, particular, history exploring relationship nutrition
mental health. can dive particulars ketogenic diets
versus diets, truly miraculous findings others
coming based real patients real experiences people suffer
find relief altering nutrition. CHRIS PALMER: Sure. story really starts
personal story. don't need go great detail. set stage,
kid, definitely mental illness, started OCD. series events
happened family. mother horrible kind psychotic break, sorts
adverse childhood events me. actually homeless together while.
went subsequent depression, suicidality, sorts things. somehow
another, pulled together got medical school-- actually quite well
medical school, got award one top students,
internship residency Harvard. point time, diagnosed
metabolic syndrome. high blood pressure, horrible lipids, pre-diabetes.
everything right supposedly. low-fat diet, exercising
regularly. year year, doctor kept telling diet exercise. kept asking
him, diet? exercise? everything kept telling do.
Everything getting worse. blood pressure kept going higher. point,
kind said, going go medication. need put
something pre-diabetes, something cholesterol, something
blood pressure. three pills gate. like, 20s. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: overweight? CHRIS PALMER: No. Technically, no. gut,
sign insulin resistance, know now. didn't know then. actually
kind leaned one point said, parents diabetes? Yeah.
parents high blood pressure? Yeah. parents overweight? Yeah. Oh,
really sorry, genetic. Basically, screwed. genes. just going
bite bullet take meds. physician, knew meant.
knew 20s, already three meds metabolic syndrome, going
screwed time 40 50. probably going heart
attacks. heard rumor mill Atkins diet somehow help


people improve cholesterol pre-diabetes. actually didn't really believe it.
highly skeptical. believed everything taught medical school.
professors lie me? knew talking about. Low-fat diet thing
do. Atkins diet clearly dangerous reckless. trying
medical dogma years, wasn't working me. whatever reason,
decided going last attempt something different. just bite
bullet go meds. tried Atkins diet. special version it.
still avoided red meat terrified red meat. tried healthy version,
probably like South Beach diet. South Beach
Diet invented. within three months, metabolic syndrome completely
gone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood pressure normalized, lipids normalized.
weight change? mentioned healthy weight
bit abdominal-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --fat. CHRIS
PALMER: lost abdominal fat. probably lost 10 pounds process.
everything got normal. went back doctor, shocked.
actually said, hell doing? ANDREW HUBERMAN: time
switched new diet, mental health, don't mind
asking? sound like clear metabolic syndrome
headed towards severe metabolic syndrome. mentioned OCD.
actually familiar this. kid, low level kind Tourette's grunt.
probably me, obsessive still extent-- although not full-blown clinically diagnosed
OCD, can relate somewhat. willing, context
nutritional switch? CHRIS PALMER: nutritional switch,
still struggling low grade depression OCD. Again, wasn't necessarily
interfering ability function functioning high level. Anybody
looking outside, top student. just got one
competitive-- actually, point, competitive residency program
country psychiatry. looked said, fine.
wasn't. actually medications. trying different medications, trying figure
feel better, stop obsessing much, not depressed.
found medications, actually came side effects
benefits. Prozac long time. totally messed sleep.
psychiatrist like, need pills help sleep now. I'm-- just-- like,
doesn't-- not really resonating well me. now psychiatrist.


psychiatry residency. thinking, know what? just not sitting well
going prescribe meds side effects
causing. yet time, wanted feel better. learning
chemical imbalances. get rid depression OCD.
supposed take pills. taking pills. psychotherapy.
psychotherapy off years. received much intensive
treatment younger. essentially worthless me. actually
probably just caused harm end day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Psychoanalysis? CHRIS PALMER: Various psychotherapies-- not psychoanalysis per
se, psychoanalytically-oriented psychotherapies. actually
hospitalized one point. put lithium imipramine, tricyclic
antidepressant, things. actually horrible. horrible.
nothing beneficial me. gave decent amount time work. really
wanted feel better. time tried diet, certainly wasn't impaired
way. wasn't struggling much. was-- still low grade
symptoms, trying feel better. thing striking me,
diet three months, not fact metabolic syndrome gone.
goal, seemingly miraculous achievement got rid
everything one dietary change. thing noticed dramatic
improvement mood, energy, concentration, sleep. I-- first time
life, started waking alarm went off feeling rested. never
happened before. meticulous planning alarm went off
many times push snooze button order time wherever
needed be, whether school hospital whatever. it. good
system. never late anything. shocking me, felt good.
one things often said people, prior diet, always felt like
two types people world. "haves" "have-nots."
happy, peppy people, just positive, got energy.
saying, like work hard play hard. always understood working
hard. totally got hard worker understood value hard
work. got something useful yourself. never understood
hell wants play hard, like got energy that? Aren't tired working
hard? Earth people energy go play hard? assumed
just part "haves" world. just lucky


privileged. either good genetics maybe good childhoods good
parents something-- something didn't have. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kids
genuine smiles yearbooks. CHRIS PALMER: Yes, exactly. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: [LAUGHS] CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whereas,
rest-- way, really appreciate sharing personal story
think important people hear understand people like
yourself, extremely high functioning accomplished, road was--
everything hearing understanding-- choppy internally times,
overcome lot order get there. also, going
sounds like long iterative process trying figure works
doesn't work finally arrive solution, make basis much
work today people. think important think
many people share notion indeed two groups-- happy
group fated-to-be unhappy group. speaks fact that-- story,
rather, speaks fact see not always going internally
people notion just two groups-- happy haves
have-nots-- can't way works, probably many people
suffering realize, important need tools overcome
suffering. really just hear you. Even early discussion, just want extend
genuine thanks much hear people questions health,
mental health, physical health. clearly point fact many
people struggling varying degrees. even people category
great childhood happiness far better

00:20:43 Low-Carb Diets & Anti-Depression, Fasting, Ketosis

also people. thank that. want know.
point realized nutrition can play profound role feel
operate large number domains, still student resident point?
CHRIS PALMER: resident. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point, decide
going explore professional context? CHRIS PALMER: Not yet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. journey forward work
now? CHRIS PALMER: next step just friends family
saw me, saw improved health, saw lost weight pretty easily.


particular, remember sister sister-in-law, got really pissed one
Thanksgiving resist pumpkin pie, apple pie, everything
else. like, hell that? resisting
food? said, don't crave anymore. don't want it, fine. just--
turkey green beans. good enough me. got diet.
noticed dramatic improvement moods, energy, sleep,
everything else. within years, primary thing noticed powerful
antidepressant effect. now, attending physician. got patients
clinical practice treatment resistant mental illness. tertiary care hospital.
almost never get somebody off street first episode depression.
gate, part career, get treatment resistant mental disorders. get
people who've already 6-plus psychiatrists, therapists. usually tried
dozens different medications. decades psychotherapy.
often ECT things. nothing's working. thinking, well, kind
options people. diet really powerful
antidepressant effect. think going try just see patients
game try see might help them. Sure enough, did. Didn't help everyone
not everybody interested and/or able it. ones able
ended remarkable powerful antidepressant effect. One woman
actually became hypomanic within month. depressed pretty much
nonstop five years-- chronically depressed, suicidal, hospitals.
saw become hypomanic. thinking, wow, really powerful
antidepressant effect. amazing. like medication better
actually working her. laid low point because, point, didn't
many clinical trials safety efficacy Atkins diet even weight loss
diabetes, let alone mental disorders. really actually felt like fringe
here. not going met praise anyone. just going lay low.
going offer patients. went along way 2016. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: may just ask diet? say "Atkins diet,"
low zero starch, low carbohydrate diet, certainly low sugar. CHRIS PALMER:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: traditional Atkins? tailoring
individual patient depending psychiatric symptoms, whether not
overweight not overweight? assuming not nutritionist,
prescribe nutrition plan patients? involved making sure


adhered that, maybe even things observed terms
willing try not try this? observations maybe even data? CHRIS
PALMER: early on, winging it. was-- first patients, try
Atkins diet. want see ketosis, going ketones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
pricking finger, blood ketone test? CHRIS
PALMER: didn't know blood ketone monitors existed back then. was--
using urine strips. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not quite accurate
still useful general guide, understand. CHRIS PALMER: True.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. CHRIS PALMER: strongly recommending patients
achieve urinary ketosis. interesting thing noticed pattern,
trying diet not getting ketones, often not get clinical benefit.
got ketosis began notice clinical benefit powerful
antidepressant effect. ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably nutrition plan, a.k.a diet,
elevated ketones urine point say, person
ketosis-- say ketosis-- step right direction,
independent exactly eating not eating get there, including
fasting? time, probably, fasting wasn't popular now. Thanks incredible
work-- think incredible, former colleague. know lot
controversy fasting. think, many people, fasting powerful tool.
others, less useful tool --of Satchin Panda others. fasting certainly will limit
carbohydrate intake get ketosis. Correct? CHRIS PALMER: will.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: patients fast intermittent fasting?
CHRIS PALMER: did. patients Atkins called fat fast,
eat primarily fat. either fast and/or eat primarily fats try get
state ketosis. patients, actually quite easy get ketosis,
especially overweight obese patients. lot fat stores body
actually limiting carbohydrates usually results high levels ketosis them.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably feel better too, imagine,
limit starch intake, start excrete lot water. People can get pretty
quick weight loss even though may not fat loss, makes feel literally little
lighter maybe little energetic. right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
years went on, field advancing, research coming out. People
getting little sophisticated blood ketone monitoring, different


versions

00:27:52 Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet

ketogenic diets. evolving practice. thing completely upended
everything knew psychiatrist, though, helped patient 2016
lose weight. patient, 33-year-old man schizoaffective disorder.
patient eight years now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: clarify
people schizoaffective disorder is? not clinician. recall, like low
level schizophrenia. might auditory hallucinations. met
person, might think kind different, quote unquote, "weird." not
seem necessarily scary typically people. mean
respect, course. oftentimes, people schizophrenia can seem just like--
don't even know interact world seems altered
so-called positive symptoms-- hallucinations,
talking people no one else can see, et cetera. schizoaffective? CHRIS
PALMER: no. schizoaffective schizophrenia essentially.
difference schizophrenia superimposed mood episodes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, actually severe than-- CHRIS PALMER: can be.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. backwards. CHRIS PALMER:
schizoaffective disorder essentially schizophrenia plus mood episodes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah, maybe thinking schizotypal? CHRIS PALMER:
Schizotypal low grade, kind mild paranoia, kind eccentric beliefs,
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Folks there, nomenclature
backwards. Schizotypal the, quote unquote, lower-- "low level" schizophrenia
schizoid-like. Schizoaffective severe. CHRIS PALMER: Full-blown
schizophrenia plus full-blown usually bipolarism. ANDREW HUBERMAN: now,
absolutely clear clinician room is. [LAUGHTER] Thank
reminder. CHRIS PALMER: No worries. man schizoaffective disorder.
daily auditory hallucinations. paranoid delusions. not go
public without terrified. convinced powerful families,
technologies control thoughts. broadcast
thoughts people. trying hurt him. targeted
reason. wasn't quite sure why. suspicions beliefs maybe


bad thing 11 years old, decided target
him. man tormented illness, tormented. ruined life. already
tried 17 different medications, none stopped symptoms.
cause gain lot weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: medications,
recall, schizophrenia-- classical ones dopamine receptor blockers-- caused
people to-- huge increases prolactin. sometimes men-- CHRIS PALMER:
Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --will get breast development. put lot
weight. catatonic-- movement disorders. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: make feel like-- imagine, given good
things release dopamine make us feel, blocking dopamine receptors
antipsychotics makes people feel lousy. CHRIS PALMER: Horrible. huge
challenge field lot patients don't want take them. get
rebound effects. patients several months, stop
cold turkey, can get wildly psychotic ill, end aggressive hospitalized
sometimes dead. him. weighs 340 pounds. whatever reason,
gets head, never going get girlfriend don't lose weight. also
recognizes, never going get girlfriend loser. schizophrenic.
live father. nothing going me. least try address one
awful, horrible things myself. maybe lose weight.
asked help. variety reasons, ended deciding try ketogenic
diet. Now, point, no anticipation ketogenic diet going
anything psychiatric symptoms man schizoaffective disorder.
not depression. Depression different. totally different disorders.
decides give try. Within two weeks, not start losing weight,
begin notice dramatic antidepressant effect. making better eye contact.
smiling more. talking lot more. thinking like, gotten you?
coming life. Like you're-- never heard talk much. never seen
excited present alive. haven't changed meds all. thing upended
everything knew psychiatrist six eight weeks in, spontaneously
starts reporting, know, voices hear time? going away.
says, know always thought families
controlling thoughts get me, targeted me? thinking,
oh, yeah. talking eight years. can talk again.
says, know what? Now think it, don't think true. now


say it, sounds kind crazy. probably never was. probably schizophrenia
along like everybody's trying tell me. think going away. man went
on-- now lost 160 pounds kept off day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
CHRIS PALMER: able things not able since time
diagnosis. able complete certificate program. able go
public not paranoid. performed improv front live audience. at? One
point, able move father's home live independently.
completely blew mind psychiatrist. went scientific journey
understand hell just happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: indeed mind-
blowing. like take quick break acknowledge

00:35:38 Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3/K2. couple
questions. First all, stay kind antipsychotic medication? so,
dosages adjusted, excuse me, undergoing remarkable transition?


know, not either medication nutrition changes, can both.
question one adherence. think someone
schizoaffective disorder, suffering sorts things described.
somebody like organize order stay ketogenic diet?
say seriousness world. think lot people
not schizotypal schizoaffective disorder trouble, claim,
adhering ketogenic diet. not easiest diet. Certainly extreme form first,
not easiest diet stick to. it? sounds like remarkable
individual. also like just know general thoughts adherence things
people back heels mentally. get motivated stick
something? questions were, medication, yes no? yes, dosage adjusted, yes
no. people suffering depression full-blown psychotic episodes,
one ensure continue adhere diet? CHRIS PALMER: terms
medications, remained medication. early on, wasn't adjusting anything.
just disbelief shock happening. didn't know going on.
years, slowly surely tried taper off meds.
meds decades. started medications young child. brain
developed response sorts psychiatric medications. not easy
try get off. continue try get off medication. challenging
difficult. just want say listeners, is-- getting off meds
difficult dangerous. need supervision, mental health
professional prescriber dangerous. people reduce meds
much, can get wildly symptomatic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true
depression well? CHRIS PALMER: true psychiatric medication. brain
makes adaptations response psychiatric medications. stop cold
turkey-- people fine. wouldn't recommend finding seen
patients-- stop antidepressants, seen patients get flooredly depressed
suicidal within three months. one patient, almost quit job
became convinced that, well, life sucks, boss. know
just horrible human being. abusing me. like, whoa,
whoa, whoa. think related medication change. got back
meds, within three days, said, oh god, can't believe happened. almost quit
job. illogical irrational decision ever
made entire life. somehow, seemed real just several days ago. now


back medication-- doesn't mean needs meds.
doesn't mean needs meds. means meds need adjusted
safely, cautiously, gradually. medication piece. adherence
piece not easy patients. rare patient
can say, ketogenic diet. Come see 3 months, let know
going. almost never happens. happened, think, two occasions.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is, understand correctly, what-- perhaps not you--
many psychiatrists medication. It's, prescription. talk in--
CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a month three months. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: variable probably worth us
exploring little bit conversation continues. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: frequent contact making micro adjustments macro
adjustments medication nutrition, meaningful. CHRIS PALMER:
Absolutely. particular patient, early on, actually pretty adherent.
seeing week. lot education. weighing him.
checking ketones. checking glucose levels. point, blood
ketone monitor office. knew whether compliant not,
beneficial clinical work research diet. diet within
seconds, can objective biomarker compliance noncompliance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: key point again, brings mind, me, parallel
medication. patient can say taking medication, unless
hospital setting, somebody's checking tongue this,
well not taking taking more. know blood draws
neurotransmitter levels complicated want know brain
functional brain. imagine people
prescribed drugs number different psychiatric conditions not giving blood
every time talk psychiatrist psychologist. No? CHRIS PALMER: No.
front, looked studies compliance, majority patients
least somewhat noncompliant prescription medications. not purpose.
forgot. take night. late. off routine. forgot
brush teeth-- take meds.
late, just crashed got home. forgot take meds. Happens
time. medication people take day,
noncompliance rates much higher just easy forget. not


people willfully disobeying doctors anything else.

00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits

just hard remember take meds consistently every day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
say measuring ketones, want drill little bit seem
presence ketones somebody being, quote unquote, "in ketosis," turns
key variable. Certainly, book, one major takeaways--
although many important takeaways-- people get ketosis.
stay ketosis? instance, followed the-- don't longer.
tried, past, so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, every third fourth day, get
pasta, rice, et cetera. interesting experiment. stay
ketosis, sort blood levels ketones like see patients?
range think people aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: really
depends patient treating, quite honestly. don't think every
patient needs ketogenic diet. patients, simply getting rid junk food can
make huge difference mood disorder, instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
junk food, meaning, highly processed food, food last shelf long
time. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods usually high sugar,
carbohydrate, carbs, fats. seem worst foods. combination-
- high sugar, high fat-- seems worst combination metabolic health. lo
behold, got emerging data suggests, strongly suggests, also bad
mental health. Depression anxiety common mental disorders.
best data disorders. actually lot data
even bipolar disorder schizophrenia insulin resistance, particular, insulin
signaling brain impaired people chronic mental disorders kind across
board-- way chronic anxiety, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia,
even Alzheimer's disease. know patients disorders
impaired glucose metabolism insulin signaling system brain,
different insulin signaling periphery, seems somehow possibly playing
role. step back that, patients, might just want decrease
glucose insulin levels. can getting rid sweets. patients,
like patients schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder, especially
chronic, using brain treatment, want ketogenic diet.


usually want reasonably high levels blood ketones. Usually, depression, want
see least greater probably 0.8 minimal. psychotic disorders bipolar
disorder, usually want see levels greater 1.5. shooting for,
possible. yeah, think go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
sorry, didn't mean imply people need ketosis order see
mental health benefits changing diet. make clear book--
go detail-- avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin
resistance, essentially trying reverse earlier described metabolic
syndrome, bunch different things, target. people,
getting rid highly processed foods focusing mainly nonprocessed minimally
processed foods will really help. others, going straight full-blown ketogenic diet
will benefit. like back little bit history

00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment

get something find incredibly interesting, epilepsy
longstanding use ketogenic diet fasting treat epilepsy. reason want
kind rewind point history that, think lot listeners people
familiar changing diet changing exercise can
positively impact sleep weight things, cascades feeling
better-- makes perfect sense. lot world still, idea changing
using nutrition dissection tool treatment tool understand treat mental
illness, still kind heretical idea, them, kind falls the, OK, well,
like woo science something like that. Now, obviously board-certified
physician psychiatrist arguably one finest medical schools world,
Harvard Medical School. Even though Stanford side, acknowledge--
acknowledge East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: Harvard-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Stanford East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: argument go back forth number times.
serious clinician serious scientist. serious thinker.
lot people there, notion using diet, immediately think, ah, well,
makes perfect sense. think category people think, well, yeah, didn't


Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate

00:07:18 Nutrition & Mental Health

checkout. now, discussion Dr. Chris Palmer. Chris, Dr. Palmer, thank
here. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, me. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: lot questions you. really excited topic
think people know mental illness is-- idea
is. people idea nutrition is. Fewer people certainly know
closely things can interact. think everybody familiar feeling
food ingestion food making feel good short term. eat
food tastes delicious us associate something nice, feel
good mentally physically. Whereas, eat something gives us food
poisoning maybe even something just doesn't taste great
associate bad experience, feel less good short term. believe
people understand familiar fact nutrition mental


health interact intimate, maybe even causal, way something
occurs long periods time. Meaning, ate yesterday day before,
maybe even 10 years ago, impacting way brain body
making feel now. would, love just tell us little bit
history, particular, history exploring relationship nutrition
mental health. can dive particulars ketogenic diets
versus diets, truly miraculous findings others
coming based real patients real experiences people suffer
find relief altering nutrition. CHRIS PALMER: Sure. story really starts
personal story. don't need go great detail. set stage,
kid, definitely mental illness, started OCD. series events
happened family. mother horrible kind psychotic break, sorts
adverse childhood events me. actually homeless together while.
went subsequent depression, suicidality, sorts things. somehow
another, pulled together got medical school-- actually quite well
medical school, got award one top students,
internship residency Harvard. point time, diagnosed
metabolic syndrome. high blood pressure, horrible lipids, pre-diabetes.
everything right supposedly. low-fat diet, exercising
regularly. year year, doctor kept telling diet exercise. kept asking
him, diet? exercise? everything kept telling do.
Everything getting worse. blood pressure kept going higher. point,
kind said, going go medication. need put
something pre-diabetes, something cholesterol, something
blood pressure. three pills gate. like, 20s. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: overweight? CHRIS PALMER: No. Technically, no. gut,
sign insulin resistance, know now. didn't know then. actually
kind leaned one point said, parents diabetes? Yeah.
parents high blood pressure? Yeah. parents overweight? Yeah. Oh,
really sorry, genetic. Basically, screwed. genes. just going
bite bullet take meds. physician, knew meant.
knew 20s, already three meds metabolic syndrome, going
screwed time 40 50. probably going heart
attacks. heard rumor mill Atkins diet somehow help


people improve cholesterol pre-diabetes. actually didn't really believe it.
highly skeptical. believed everything taught medical school.
professors lie me? knew talking about. Low-fat diet thing
do. Atkins diet clearly dangerous reckless. trying
medical dogma years, wasn't working me. whatever reason,
decided going last attempt something different. just bite
bullet go meds. tried Atkins diet. special version it.
still avoided red meat terrified red meat. tried healthy version,
probably like South Beach diet. South Beach
Diet invented. within three months, metabolic syndrome completely
gone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood pressure normalized, lipids normalized.
weight change? mentioned healthy weight
bit abdominal-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --fat. CHRIS
PALMER: lost abdominal fat. probably lost 10 pounds process.
everything got normal. went back doctor, shocked.
actually said, hell doing? ANDREW HUBERMAN: time
switched new diet, mental health, don't mind
asking? sound like clear metabolic syndrome
headed towards severe metabolic syndrome. mentioned OCD.
actually familiar this. kid, low level kind Tourette's grunt.
probably me, obsessive still extent-- although not full-blown clinically diagnosed
OCD, can relate somewhat. willing, context
nutritional switch? CHRIS PALMER: nutritional switch,
still struggling low grade depression OCD. Again, wasn't necessarily
interfering ability function functioning high level. Anybody
looking outside, top student. just got one
competitive-- actually, point, competitive residency program
country psychiatry. looked said, fine.
wasn't. actually medications. trying different medications, trying figure
feel better, stop obsessing much, not depressed.
found medications, actually came side effects
benefits. Prozac long time. totally messed sleep.
psychiatrist like, need pills help sleep now. I'm-- just-- like,
doesn't-- not really resonating well me. now psychiatrist.


psychiatry residency. thinking, know what? just not sitting well
going prescribe meds side effects
causing. yet time, wanted feel better. learning
chemical imbalances. get rid depression OCD.
supposed take pills. taking pills. psychotherapy.
psychotherapy off years. received much intensive
treatment younger. essentially worthless me. actually
probably just caused harm end day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Psychoanalysis? CHRIS PALMER: Various psychotherapies-- not psychoanalysis per
se, psychoanalytically-oriented psychotherapies. actually
hospitalized one point. put lithium imipramine, tricyclic
antidepressant, things. actually horrible. horrible.
nothing beneficial me. gave decent amount time work. really
wanted feel better. time tried diet, certainly wasn't impaired
way. wasn't struggling much. was-- still low grade
symptoms, trying feel better. thing striking me,
diet three months, not fact metabolic syndrome gone.
goal, seemingly miraculous achievement got rid
everything one dietary change. thing noticed dramatic
improvement mood, energy, concentration, sleep. I-- first time
life, started waking alarm went off feeling rested. never
happened before. meticulous planning alarm went off
many times push snooze button order time wherever
needed be, whether school hospital whatever. it. good
system. never late anything. shocking me, felt good.
one things often said people, prior diet, always felt like
two types people world. "haves" "have-nots."
happy, peppy people, just positive, got energy.
saying, like work hard play hard. always understood working
hard. totally got hard worker understood value hard
work. got something useful yourself. never understood
hell wants play hard, like got energy that? Aren't tired working
hard? Earth people energy go play hard? assumed
just part "haves" world. just lucky


privileged. either good genetics maybe good childhoods good
parents something-- something didn't have. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kids
genuine smiles yearbooks. CHRIS PALMER: Yes, exactly. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: [LAUGHS] CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whereas,
rest-- way, really appreciate sharing personal story
think important people hear understand people like
yourself, extremely high functioning accomplished, road was--
everything hearing understanding-- choppy internally times,
overcome lot order get there. also, going
sounds like long iterative process trying figure works
doesn't work finally arrive solution, make basis much
work today people. think important think
many people share notion indeed two groups-- happy
group fated-to-be unhappy group. speaks fact that-- story,
rather, speaks fact see not always going internally
people notion just two groups-- happy haves
have-nots-- can't way works, probably many people
suffering realize, important need tools overcome
suffering. really just hear you. Even early discussion, just want extend
genuine thanks much hear people questions health,
mental health, physical health. clearly point fact many
people struggling varying degrees. even people category
great childhood happiness far better

00:20:43 Low-Carb Diets & Anti-Depression, Fasting, Ketosis

also people. thank that. want know.
point realized nutrition can play profound role feel
operate large number domains, still student resident point?
CHRIS PALMER: resident. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point, decide
going explore professional context? CHRIS PALMER: Not yet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. journey forward work
now? CHRIS PALMER: next step just friends family
saw me, saw improved health, saw lost weight pretty easily.


particular, remember sister sister-in-law, got really pissed one
Thanksgiving resist pumpkin pie, apple pie, everything
else. like, hell that? resisting
food? said, don't crave anymore. don't want it, fine. just--
turkey green beans. good enough me. got diet.
noticed dramatic improvement moods, energy, sleep,
everything else. within years, primary thing noticed powerful
antidepressant effect. now, attending physician. got patients
clinical practice treatment resistant mental illness. tertiary care hospital.
almost never get somebody off street first episode depression.
gate, part career, get treatment resistant mental disorders. get
people who've already 6-plus psychiatrists, therapists. usually tried
dozens different medications. decades psychotherapy.
often ECT things. nothing's working. thinking, well, kind
options people. diet really powerful
antidepressant effect. think going try just see patients
game try see might help them. Sure enough, did. Didn't help everyone
not everybody interested and/or able it. ones able
ended remarkable powerful antidepressant effect. One woman
actually became hypomanic within month. depressed pretty much
nonstop five years-- chronically depressed, suicidal, hospitals.
saw become hypomanic. thinking, wow, really powerful
antidepressant effect. amazing. like medication better
actually working her. laid low point because, point, didn't
many clinical trials safety efficacy Atkins diet even weight loss
diabetes, let alone mental disorders. really actually felt like fringe
here. not going met praise anyone. just going lay low.
going offer patients. went along way 2016. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: may just ask diet? say "Atkins diet,"
low zero starch, low carbohydrate diet, certainly low sugar. CHRIS PALMER:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: traditional Atkins? tailoring
individual patient depending psychiatric symptoms, whether not
overweight not overweight? assuming not nutritionist,
prescribe nutrition plan patients? involved making sure


adhered that, maybe even things observed terms
willing try not try this? observations maybe even data? CHRIS
PALMER: early on, winging it. was-- first patients, try
Atkins diet. want see ketosis, going ketones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
pricking finger, blood ketone test? CHRIS
PALMER: didn't know blood ketone monitors existed back then. was--
using urine strips. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not quite accurate
still useful general guide, understand. CHRIS PALMER: True.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. CHRIS PALMER: strongly recommending patients
achieve urinary ketosis. interesting thing noticed pattern,
trying diet not getting ketones, often not get clinical benefit.
got ketosis began notice clinical benefit powerful
antidepressant effect. ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably nutrition plan, a.k.a diet,
elevated ketones urine point say, person
ketosis-- say ketosis-- step right direction,
independent exactly eating not eating get there, including
fasting? time, probably, fasting wasn't popular now. Thanks incredible
work-- think incredible, former colleague. know lot
controversy fasting. think, many people, fasting powerful tool.
others, less useful tool --of Satchin Panda others. fasting certainly will limit
carbohydrate intake get ketosis. Correct? CHRIS PALMER: will.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: patients fast intermittent fasting?
CHRIS PALMER: did. patients Atkins called fat fast,
eat primarily fat. either fast and/or eat primarily fats try get
state ketosis. patients, actually quite easy get ketosis,
especially overweight obese patients. lot fat stores body
actually limiting carbohydrates usually results high levels ketosis them.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably feel better too, imagine,
limit starch intake, start excrete lot water. People can get pretty
quick weight loss even though may not fat loss, makes feel literally little
lighter maybe little energetic. right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
years went on, field advancing, research coming out. People
getting little sophisticated blood ketone monitoring, different


versions

00:27:52 Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet

ketogenic diets. evolving practice. thing completely upended
everything knew psychiatrist, though, helped patient 2016
lose weight. patient, 33-year-old man schizoaffective disorder.
patient eight years now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: clarify
people schizoaffective disorder is? not clinician. recall, like low
level schizophrenia. might auditory hallucinations. met
person, might think kind different, quote unquote, "weird." not
seem necessarily scary typically people. mean
respect, course. oftentimes, people schizophrenia can seem just like--
don't even know interact world seems altered
so-called positive symptoms-- hallucinations,
talking people no one else can see, et cetera. schizoaffective? CHRIS
PALMER: no. schizoaffective schizophrenia essentially.
difference schizophrenia superimposed mood episodes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, actually severe than-- CHRIS PALMER: can be.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. backwards. CHRIS PALMER:
schizoaffective disorder essentially schizophrenia plus mood episodes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah, maybe thinking schizotypal? CHRIS PALMER:
Schizotypal low grade, kind mild paranoia, kind eccentric beliefs,
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Folks there, nomenclature
backwards. Schizotypal the, quote unquote, lower-- "low level" schizophrenia
schizoid-like. Schizoaffective severe. CHRIS PALMER: Full-blown
schizophrenia plus full-blown usually bipolarism. ANDREW HUBERMAN: now,
absolutely clear clinician room is. [LAUGHTER] Thank
reminder. CHRIS PALMER: No worries. man schizoaffective disorder.
daily auditory hallucinations. paranoid delusions. not go
public without terrified. convinced powerful families,
technologies control thoughts. broadcast
thoughts people. trying hurt him. targeted
reason. wasn't quite sure why. suspicions beliefs maybe


bad thing 11 years old, decided target
him. man tormented illness, tormented. ruined life. already
tried 17 different medications, none stopped symptoms.
cause gain lot weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: medications,
recall, schizophrenia-- classical ones dopamine receptor blockers-- caused
people to-- huge increases prolactin. sometimes men-- CHRIS PALMER:
Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --will get breast development. put lot
weight. catatonic-- movement disorders. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: make feel like-- imagine, given good
things release dopamine make us feel, blocking dopamine receptors
antipsychotics makes people feel lousy. CHRIS PALMER: Horrible. huge
challenge field lot patients don't want take them. get
rebound effects. patients several months, stop
cold turkey, can get wildly psychotic ill, end aggressive hospitalized
sometimes dead. him. weighs 340 pounds. whatever reason,
gets head, never going get girlfriend don't lose weight. also
recognizes, never going get girlfriend loser. schizophrenic.
live father. nothing going me. least try address one
awful, horrible things myself. maybe lose weight.
asked help. variety reasons, ended deciding try ketogenic
diet. Now, point, no anticipation ketogenic diet going
anything psychiatric symptoms man schizoaffective disorder.
not depression. Depression different. totally different disorders.
decides give try. Within two weeks, not start losing weight,
begin notice dramatic antidepressant effect. making better eye contact.
smiling more. talking lot more. thinking like, gotten you?
coming life. Like you're-- never heard talk much. never seen
excited present alive. haven't changed meds all. thing upended
everything knew psychiatrist six eight weeks in, spontaneously
starts reporting, know, voices hear time? going away.
says, know always thought families
controlling thoughts get me, targeted me? thinking,
oh, yeah. talking eight years. can talk again.
says, know what? Now think it, don't think true. now


say it, sounds kind crazy. probably never was. probably schizophrenia
along like everybody's trying tell me. think going away. man went
on-- now lost 160 pounds kept off day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
CHRIS PALMER: able things not able since time
diagnosis. able complete certificate program. able go
public not paranoid. performed improv front live audience. at? One
point, able move father's home live independently.
completely blew mind psychiatrist. went scientific journey
understand hell just happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: indeed mind-
blowing. like take quick break acknowledge

00:35:38 Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3/K2. couple
questions. First all, stay kind antipsychotic medication? so,
dosages adjusted, excuse me, undergoing remarkable transition?


know, not either medication nutrition changes, can both.
question one adherence. think someone
schizoaffective disorder, suffering sorts things described.
somebody like organize order stay ketogenic diet?
say seriousness world. think lot people
not schizotypal schizoaffective disorder trouble, claim,
adhering ketogenic diet. not easiest diet. Certainly extreme form first,
not easiest diet stick to. it? sounds like remarkable
individual. also like just know general thoughts adherence things
people back heels mentally. get motivated stick
something? questions were, medication, yes no? yes, dosage adjusted, yes
no. people suffering depression full-blown psychotic episodes,
one ensure continue adhere diet? CHRIS PALMER: terms
medications, remained medication. early on, wasn't adjusting anything.
just disbelief shock happening. didn't know going on.
years, slowly surely tried taper off meds.
meds decades. started medications young child. brain
developed response sorts psychiatric medications. not easy
try get off. continue try get off medication. challenging
difficult. just want say listeners, is-- getting off meds
difficult dangerous. need supervision, mental health
professional prescriber dangerous. people reduce meds
much, can get wildly symptomatic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true
depression well? CHRIS PALMER: true psychiatric medication. brain
makes adaptations response psychiatric medications. stop cold
turkey-- people fine. wouldn't recommend finding seen
patients-- stop antidepressants, seen patients get flooredly depressed
suicidal within three months. one patient, almost quit job
became convinced that, well, life sucks, boss. know
just horrible human being. abusing me. like, whoa,
whoa, whoa. think related medication change. got back
meds, within three days, said, oh god, can't believe happened. almost quit
job. illogical irrational decision ever
made entire life. somehow, seemed real just several days ago. now


back medication-- doesn't mean needs meds.
doesn't mean needs meds. means meds need adjusted
safely, cautiously, gradually. medication piece. adherence
piece not easy patients. rare patient
can say, ketogenic diet. Come see 3 months, let know
going. almost never happens. happened, think, two occasions.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is, understand correctly, what-- perhaps not you--
many psychiatrists medication. It's, prescription. talk in--
CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a month three months. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: variable probably worth us
exploring little bit conversation continues. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: frequent contact making micro adjustments macro
adjustments medication nutrition, meaningful. CHRIS PALMER:
Absolutely. particular patient, early on, actually pretty adherent.
seeing week. lot education. weighing him.
checking ketones. checking glucose levels. point, blood
ketone monitor office. knew whether compliant not,
beneficial clinical work research diet. diet within
seconds, can objective biomarker compliance noncompliance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: key point again, brings mind, me, parallel
medication. patient can say taking medication, unless
hospital setting, somebody's checking tongue this,
well not taking taking more. know blood draws
neurotransmitter levels complicated want know brain
functional brain. imagine people
prescribed drugs number different psychiatric conditions not giving blood
every time talk psychiatrist psychologist. No? CHRIS PALMER: No.
front, looked studies compliance, majority patients
least somewhat noncompliant prescription medications. not purpose.
forgot. take night. late. off routine. forgot
brush teeth-- take meds.
late, just crashed got home. forgot take meds. Happens
time. medication people take day,
noncompliance rates much higher just easy forget. not


people willfully disobeying doctors anything else.

00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits

just hard remember take meds consistently every day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
say measuring ketones, want drill little bit seem
presence ketones somebody being, quote unquote, "in ketosis," turns
key variable. Certainly, book, one major takeaways--
although many important takeaways-- people get ketosis.
stay ketosis? instance, followed the-- don't longer.
tried, past, so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, every third fourth day, get
pasta, rice, et cetera. interesting experiment. stay
ketosis, sort blood levels ketones like see patients?
range think people aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: really
depends patient treating, quite honestly. don't think every
patient needs ketogenic diet. patients, simply getting rid junk food can
make huge difference mood disorder, instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
junk food, meaning, highly processed food, food last shelf long
time. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods usually high sugar,
carbohydrate, carbs, fats. seem worst foods. combination-
- high sugar, high fat-- seems worst combination metabolic health. lo
behold, got emerging data suggests, strongly suggests, also bad
mental health. Depression anxiety common mental disorders.
best data disorders. actually lot data
even bipolar disorder schizophrenia insulin resistance, particular, insulin
signaling brain impaired people chronic mental disorders kind across
board-- way chronic anxiety, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia,
even Alzheimer's disease. know patients disorders
impaired glucose metabolism insulin signaling system brain,
different insulin signaling periphery, seems somehow possibly playing
role. step back that, patients, might just want decrease
glucose insulin levels. can getting rid sweets. patients,
like patients schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder, especially
chronic, using brain treatment, want ketogenic diet.


usually want reasonably high levels blood ketones. Usually, depression, want
see least greater probably 0.8 minimal. psychotic disorders bipolar
disorder, usually want see levels greater 1.5. shooting for,
possible. yeah, think go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
sorry, didn't mean imply people need ketosis order see
mental health benefits changing diet. make clear book--
go detail-- avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin
resistance, essentially trying reverse earlier described metabolic
syndrome, bunch different things, target. people,
getting rid highly processed foods focusing mainly nonprocessed minimally
processed foods will really help. others, going straight full-blown ketogenic diet
will benefit. like back little bit history

00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment

get something find incredibly interesting, epilepsy
longstanding use ketogenic diet fasting treat epilepsy. reason want
kind rewind point history that, think lot listeners people
familiar changing diet changing exercise can
positively impact sleep weight things, cascades feeling
better-- makes perfect sense. lot world still, idea changing
using nutrition dissection tool treatment tool understand treat mental
illness, still kind heretical idea, them, kind falls the, OK, well,
like woo science something like that. Now, obviously board-certified
physician psychiatrist arguably one finest medical schools world,
Harvard Medical School. Even though Stanford side, acknowledge--
acknowledge East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: Harvard-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Stanford East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: argument go back forth number times.
serious clinician serious scientist. serious thinker.
lot people there, notion using diet, immediately think, ah, well,
makes perfect sense. think category people think, well, yeah, didn't


Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes

poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate

important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,

health interact intimate, maybe even causal, way something
occurs long periods time. Meaning, ate yesterday day before,
maybe even 10 years ago, impacting way brain body
making feel now. would, love just tell us little bit
history, particular, history exploring relationship nutrition
mental health. can dive particulars ketogenic diets
versus diets, truly miraculous findings others
coming based real patients real experiences people suffer
find relief altering nutrition. CHRIS PALMER: Sure. story really starts
personal story. don't need go great detail. set stage,
kid, definitely mental illness, started OCD. series events
happened family. mother horrible kind psychotic break, sorts
adverse childhood events me. actually homeless together while.
went subsequent depression, suicidality, sorts things. somehow
another, pulled together got medical school-- actually quite well
medical school, got award one top students,
internship residency Harvard. point time, diagnosed
metabolic syndrome. high blood pressure, horrible lipids, pre-diabetes.
everything right supposedly. low-fat diet, exercising
regularly. year year, doctor kept telling diet exercise. kept asking
him, diet? exercise? everything kept telling do.
Everything getting worse. blood pressure kept going higher. point,
kind said, going go medication. need put
something pre-diabetes, something cholesterol, something
blood pressure. three pills gate. like, 20s. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: overweight? CHRIS PALMER: No. Technically, no. gut,
sign insulin resistance, know now. didn't know then. actually
kind leaned one point said, parents diabetes? Yeah.
parents high blood pressure? Yeah. parents overweight? Yeah. Oh,
really sorry, genetic. Basically, screwed. genes. just going
bite bullet take meds. physician, knew meant.
knew 20s, already three meds metabolic syndrome, going
screwed time 40 50. probably going heart
attacks. heard rumor mill Atkins diet somehow help


people improve cholesterol pre-diabetes. actually didn't really believe it.
highly skeptical. believed everything taught medical school.
professors lie me? knew talking about. Low-fat diet thing
do. Atkins diet clearly dangerous reckless. trying
medical dogma years, wasn't working me. whatever reason,
decided going last attempt something different. just bite
bullet go meds. tried Atkins diet. special version it.
still avoided red meat terrified red meat. tried healthy version,
probably like South Beach diet. South Beach
Diet invented. within three months, metabolic syndrome completely
gone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood pressure normalized, lipids normalized.
weight change? mentioned healthy weight
bit abdominal-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --fat. CHRIS
PALMER: lost abdominal fat. probably lost 10 pounds process.
everything got normal. went back doctor, shocked.
actually said, hell doing? ANDREW HUBERMAN: time
switched new diet, mental health, don't mind
asking? sound like clear metabolic syndrome
headed towards severe metabolic syndrome. mentioned OCD.
actually familiar this. kid, low level kind Tourette's grunt.
probably me, obsessive still extent-- although not full-blown clinically diagnosed
OCD, can relate somewhat. willing, context
nutritional switch? CHRIS PALMER: nutritional switch,
still struggling low grade depression OCD. Again, wasn't necessarily
interfering ability function functioning high level. Anybody
looking outside, top student. just got one
competitive-- actually, point, competitive residency program
country psychiatry. looked said, fine.
wasn't. actually medications. trying different medications, trying figure
feel better, stop obsessing much, not depressed.
found medications, actually came side effects
benefits. Prozac long time. totally messed sleep.
psychiatrist like, need pills help sleep now. I'm-- just-- like,
doesn't-- not really resonating well me. now psychiatrist.


psychiatry residency. thinking, know what? just not sitting well
going prescribe meds side effects
causing. yet time, wanted feel better. learning
chemical imbalances. get rid depression OCD.
supposed take pills. taking pills. psychotherapy.
psychotherapy off years. received much intensive
treatment younger. essentially worthless me. actually
probably just caused harm end day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Psychoanalysis? CHRIS PALMER: Various psychotherapies-- not psychoanalysis per
se, psychoanalytically-oriented psychotherapies. actually
hospitalized one point. put lithium imipramine, tricyclic
antidepressant, things. actually horrible. horrible.
nothing beneficial me. gave decent amount time work. really
wanted feel better. time tried diet, certainly wasn't impaired
way. wasn't struggling much. was-- still low grade
symptoms, trying feel better. thing striking me,
diet three months, not fact metabolic syndrome gone.
goal, seemingly miraculous achievement got rid
everything one dietary change. thing noticed dramatic
improvement mood, energy, concentration, sleep. I-- first time
life, started waking alarm went off feeling rested. never
happened before. meticulous planning alarm went off
many times push snooze button order time wherever
needed be, whether school hospital whatever. it. good
system. never late anything. shocking me, felt good.
one things often said people, prior diet, always felt like
two types people world. "haves" "have-nots."
happy, peppy people, just positive, got energy.
saying, like work hard play hard. always understood working
hard. totally got hard worker understood value hard
work. got something useful yourself. never understood
hell wants play hard, like got energy that? Aren't tired working
hard? Earth people energy go play hard? assumed
just part "haves" world. just lucky


privileged. either good genetics maybe good childhoods good
parents something-- something didn't have. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kids
genuine smiles yearbooks. CHRIS PALMER: Yes, exactly. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: [LAUGHS] CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whereas,
rest-- way, really appreciate sharing personal story
think important people hear understand people like
yourself, extremely high functioning accomplished, road was--
everything hearing understanding-- choppy internally times,
overcome lot order get there. also, going
sounds like long iterative process trying figure works
doesn't work finally arrive solution, make basis much
work today people. think important think
many people share notion indeed two groups-- happy
group fated-to-be unhappy group. speaks fact that-- story,
rather, speaks fact see not always going internally
people notion just two groups-- happy haves
have-nots-- can't way works, probably many people
suffering realize, important need tools overcome
suffering. really just hear you. Even early discussion, just want extend
genuine thanks much hear people questions health,
mental health, physical health. clearly point fact many
people struggling varying degrees. even people category
great childhood happiness far better

00:20:43 Low-Carb Diets & Anti-Depression, Fasting, Ketosis

also people. thank that. want know.
point realized nutrition can play profound role feel
operate large number domains, still student resident point?
CHRIS PALMER: resident. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point, decide
going explore professional context? CHRIS PALMER: Not yet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. journey forward work
now? CHRIS PALMER: next step just friends family
saw me, saw improved health, saw lost weight pretty easily.


particular, remember sister sister-in-law, got really pissed one
Thanksgiving resist pumpkin pie, apple pie, everything
else. like, hell that? resisting
food? said, don't crave anymore. don't want it, fine. just--
turkey green beans. good enough me. got diet.
noticed dramatic improvement moods, energy, sleep,
everything else. within years, primary thing noticed powerful
antidepressant effect. now, attending physician. got patients
clinical practice treatment resistant mental illness. tertiary care hospital.
almost never get somebody off street first episode depression.
gate, part career, get treatment resistant mental disorders. get
people who've already 6-plus psychiatrists, therapists. usually tried
dozens different medications. decades psychotherapy.
often ECT things. nothing's working. thinking, well, kind
options people. diet really powerful
antidepressant effect. think going try just see patients
game try see might help them. Sure enough, did. Didn't help everyone
not everybody interested and/or able it. ones able
ended remarkable powerful antidepressant effect. One woman
actually became hypomanic within month. depressed pretty much
nonstop five years-- chronically depressed, suicidal, hospitals.
saw become hypomanic. thinking, wow, really powerful
antidepressant effect. amazing. like medication better
actually working her. laid low point because, point, didn't
many clinical trials safety efficacy Atkins diet even weight loss
diabetes, let alone mental disorders. really actually felt like fringe
here. not going met praise anyone. just going lay low.
going offer patients. went along way 2016. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: may just ask diet? say "Atkins diet,"
low zero starch, low carbohydrate diet, certainly low sugar. CHRIS PALMER:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: traditional Atkins? tailoring
individual patient depending psychiatric symptoms, whether not
overweight not overweight? assuming not nutritionist,
prescribe nutrition plan patients? involved making sure


adhered that, maybe even things observed terms
willing try not try this? observations maybe even data? CHRIS
PALMER: early on, winging it. was-- first patients, try
Atkins diet. want see ketosis, going ketones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
pricking finger, blood ketone test? CHRIS
PALMER: didn't know blood ketone monitors existed back then. was--
using urine strips. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not quite accurate
still useful general guide, understand. CHRIS PALMER: True.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. CHRIS PALMER: strongly recommending patients
achieve urinary ketosis. interesting thing noticed pattern,
trying diet not getting ketones, often not get clinical benefit.
got ketosis began notice clinical benefit powerful
antidepressant effect. ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably nutrition plan, a.k.a diet,
elevated ketones urine point say, person
ketosis-- say ketosis-- step right direction,
independent exactly eating not eating get there, including
fasting? time, probably, fasting wasn't popular now. Thanks incredible
work-- think incredible, former colleague. know lot
controversy fasting. think, many people, fasting powerful tool.
others, less useful tool --of Satchin Panda others. fasting certainly will limit
carbohydrate intake get ketosis. Correct? CHRIS PALMER: will.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: patients fast intermittent fasting?
CHRIS PALMER: did. patients Atkins called fat fast,
eat primarily fat. either fast and/or eat primarily fats try get
state ketosis. patients, actually quite easy get ketosis,
especially overweight obese patients. lot fat stores body
actually limiting carbohydrates usually results high levels ketosis them.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably feel better too, imagine,
limit starch intake, start excrete lot water. People can get pretty
quick weight loss even though may not fat loss, makes feel literally little
lighter maybe little energetic. right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
years went on, field advancing, research coming out. People
getting little sophisticated blood ketone monitoring, different


versions

00:27:52 Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet

ketogenic diets. evolving practice. thing completely upended
everything knew psychiatrist, though, helped patient 2016
lose weight. patient, 33-year-old man schizoaffective disorder.
patient eight years now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: clarify
people schizoaffective disorder is? not clinician. recall, like low
level schizophrenia. might auditory hallucinations. met
person, might think kind different, quote unquote, "weird." not
seem necessarily scary typically people. mean
respect, course. oftentimes, people schizophrenia can seem just like--
don't even know interact world seems altered
so-called positive symptoms-- hallucinations,
talking people no one else can see, et cetera. schizoaffective? CHRIS
PALMER: no. schizoaffective schizophrenia essentially.
difference schizophrenia superimposed mood episodes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, actually severe than-- CHRIS PALMER: can be.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. backwards. CHRIS PALMER:
schizoaffective disorder essentially schizophrenia plus mood episodes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah, maybe thinking schizotypal? CHRIS PALMER:
Schizotypal low grade, kind mild paranoia, kind eccentric beliefs,
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Folks there, nomenclature
backwards. Schizotypal the, quote unquote, lower-- "low level" schizophrenia
schizoid-like. Schizoaffective severe. CHRIS PALMER: Full-blown
schizophrenia plus full-blown usually bipolarism. ANDREW HUBERMAN: now,
absolutely clear clinician room is. [LAUGHTER] Thank
reminder. CHRIS PALMER: No worries. man schizoaffective disorder.
daily auditory hallucinations. paranoid delusions. not go
public without terrified. convinced powerful families,
technologies control thoughts. broadcast
thoughts people. trying hurt him. targeted
reason. wasn't quite sure why. suspicions beliefs maybe


bad thing 11 years old, decided target
him. man tormented illness, tormented. ruined life. already
tried 17 different medications, none stopped symptoms.
cause gain lot weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: medications,
recall, schizophrenia-- classical ones dopamine receptor blockers-- caused
people to-- huge increases prolactin. sometimes men-- CHRIS PALMER:
Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --will get breast development. put lot
weight. catatonic-- movement disorders. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: make feel like-- imagine, given good
things release dopamine make us feel, blocking dopamine receptors
antipsychotics makes people feel lousy. CHRIS PALMER: Horrible. huge
challenge field lot patients don't want take them. get
rebound effects. patients several months, stop
cold turkey, can get wildly psychotic ill, end aggressive hospitalized
sometimes dead. him. weighs 340 pounds. whatever reason,
gets head, never going get girlfriend don't lose weight. also
recognizes, never going get girlfriend loser. schizophrenic.
live father. nothing going me. least try address one
awful, horrible things myself. maybe lose weight.
asked help. variety reasons, ended deciding try ketogenic
diet. Now, point, no anticipation ketogenic diet going
anything psychiatric symptoms man schizoaffective disorder.
not depression. Depression different. totally different disorders.
decides give try. Within two weeks, not start losing weight,
begin notice dramatic antidepressant effect. making better eye contact.
smiling more. talking lot more. thinking like, gotten you?
coming life. Like you're-- never heard talk much. never seen
excited present alive. haven't changed meds all. thing upended
everything knew psychiatrist six eight weeks in, spontaneously
starts reporting, know, voices hear time? going away.
says, know always thought families
controlling thoughts get me, targeted me? thinking,
oh, yeah. talking eight years. can talk again.
says, know what? Now think it, don't think true. now


say it, sounds kind crazy. probably never was. probably schizophrenia
along like everybody's trying tell me. think going away. man went
on-- now lost 160 pounds kept off day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
CHRIS PALMER: able things not able since time
diagnosis. able complete certificate program. able go
public not paranoid. performed improv front live audience. at? One
point, able move father's home live independently.
completely blew mind psychiatrist. went scientific journey
understand hell just happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: indeed mind-
blowing. like take quick break acknowledge

00:35:38 Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3/K2. couple
questions. First all, stay kind antipsychotic medication? so,
dosages adjusted, excuse me, undergoing remarkable transition?


know, not either medication nutrition changes, can both.
question one adherence. think someone
schizoaffective disorder, suffering sorts things described.
somebody like organize order stay ketogenic diet?
say seriousness world. think lot people
not schizotypal schizoaffective disorder trouble, claim,
adhering ketogenic diet. not easiest diet. Certainly extreme form first,
not easiest diet stick to. it? sounds like remarkable
individual. also like just know general thoughts adherence things
people back heels mentally. get motivated stick
something? questions were, medication, yes no? yes, dosage adjusted, yes
no. people suffering depression full-blown psychotic episodes,
one ensure continue adhere diet? CHRIS PALMER: terms
medications, remained medication. early on, wasn't adjusting anything.
just disbelief shock happening. didn't know going on.
years, slowly surely tried taper off meds.
meds decades. started medications young child. brain
developed response sorts psychiatric medications. not easy
try get off. continue try get off medication. challenging
difficult. just want say listeners, is-- getting off meds
difficult dangerous. need supervision, mental health
professional prescriber dangerous. people reduce meds
much, can get wildly symptomatic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true
depression well? CHRIS PALMER: true psychiatric medication. brain
makes adaptations response psychiatric medications. stop cold
turkey-- people fine. wouldn't recommend finding seen
patients-- stop antidepressants, seen patients get flooredly depressed
suicidal within three months. one patient, almost quit job
became convinced that, well, life sucks, boss. know
just horrible human being. abusing me. like, whoa,
whoa, whoa. think related medication change. got back
meds, within three days, said, oh god, can't believe happened. almost quit
job. illogical irrational decision ever
made entire life. somehow, seemed real just several days ago. now


back medication-- doesn't mean needs meds.
doesn't mean needs meds. means meds need adjusted
safely, cautiously, gradually. medication piece. adherence
piece not easy patients. rare patient
can say, ketogenic diet. Come see 3 months, let know
going. almost never happens. happened, think, two occasions.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is, understand correctly, what-- perhaps not you--
many psychiatrists medication. It's, prescription. talk in--
CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a month three months. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: variable probably worth us
exploring little bit conversation continues. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: frequent contact making micro adjustments macro
adjustments medication nutrition, meaningful. CHRIS PALMER:
Absolutely. particular patient, early on, actually pretty adherent.
seeing week. lot education. weighing him.
checking ketones. checking glucose levels. point, blood
ketone monitor office. knew whether compliant not,
beneficial clinical work research diet. diet within
seconds, can objective biomarker compliance noncompliance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: key point again, brings mind, me, parallel
medication. patient can say taking medication, unless
hospital setting, somebody's checking tongue this,
well not taking taking more. know blood draws
neurotransmitter levels complicated want know brain
functional brain. imagine people
prescribed drugs number different psychiatric conditions not giving blood
every time talk psychiatrist psychologist. No? CHRIS PALMER: No.
front, looked studies compliance, majority patients
least somewhat noncompliant prescription medications. not purpose.
forgot. take night. late. off routine. forgot
brush teeth-- take meds.
late, just crashed got home. forgot take meds. Happens
time. medication people take day,
noncompliance rates much higher just easy forget. not


people willfully disobeying doctors anything else.

00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits

just hard remember take meds consistently every day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
say measuring ketones, want drill little bit seem
presence ketones somebody being, quote unquote, "in ketosis," turns
key variable. Certainly, book, one major takeaways--
although many important takeaways-- people get ketosis.
stay ketosis? instance, followed the-- don't longer.
tried, past, so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, every third fourth day, get
pasta, rice, et cetera. interesting experiment. stay
ketosis, sort blood levels ketones like see patients?
range think people aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: really
depends patient treating, quite honestly. don't think every
patient needs ketogenic diet. patients, simply getting rid junk food can
make huge difference mood disorder, instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
junk food, meaning, highly processed food, food last shelf long
time. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods usually high sugar,
carbohydrate, carbs, fats. seem worst foods. combination-
- high sugar, high fat-- seems worst combination metabolic health. lo
behold, got emerging data suggests, strongly suggests, also bad
mental health. Depression anxiety common mental disorders.
best data disorders. actually lot data
even bipolar disorder schizophrenia insulin resistance, particular, insulin
signaling brain impaired people chronic mental disorders kind across
board-- way chronic anxiety, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia,
even Alzheimer's disease. know patients disorders
impaired glucose metabolism insulin signaling system brain,
different insulin signaling periphery, seems somehow possibly playing
role. step back that, patients, might just want decrease
glucose insulin levels. can getting rid sweets. patients,
like patients schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder, especially
chronic, using brain treatment, want ketogenic diet.


usually want reasonably high levels blood ketones. Usually, depression, want
see least greater probably 0.8 minimal. psychotic disorders bipolar
disorder, usually want see levels greater 1.5. shooting for,
possible. yeah, think go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
sorry, didn't mean imply people need ketosis order see
mental health benefits changing diet. make clear book--
go detail-- avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin
resistance, essentially trying reverse earlier described metabolic
syndrome, bunch different things, target. people,
getting rid highly processed foods focusing mainly nonprocessed minimally
processed foods will really help. others, going straight full-blown ketogenic diet
will benefit. like back little bit history

00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment

get something find incredibly interesting, epilepsy
longstanding use ketogenic diet fasting treat epilepsy. reason want
kind rewind point history that, think lot listeners people
familiar changing diet changing exercise can
positively impact sleep weight things, cascades feeling
better-- makes perfect sense. lot world still, idea changing
using nutrition dissection tool treatment tool understand treat mental
illness, still kind heretical idea, them, kind falls the, OK, well,
like woo science something like that. Now, obviously board-certified
physician psychiatrist arguably one finest medical schools world,
Harvard Medical School. Even though Stanford side, acknowledge--
acknowledge East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: Harvard-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Stanford East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: argument go back forth number times.
serious clinician serious scientist. serious thinker.
lot people there, notion using diet, immediately think, ah, well,
makes perfect sense. think category people think, well, yeah, didn't


Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, brave

people improve cholesterol pre-diabetes. actually didn't really believe it.
highly skeptical. believed everything taught medical school.
professors lie me? knew talking about. Low-fat diet thing
do. Atkins diet clearly dangerous reckless. trying
medical dogma years, wasn't working me. whatever reason,
decided going last attempt something different. just bite
bullet go meds. tried Atkins diet. special version it.
still avoided red meat terrified red meat. tried healthy version,
probably like South Beach diet. South Beach
Diet invented. within three months, metabolic syndrome completely
gone. ANDREW HUBERMAN: blood pressure normalized, lipids normalized.
weight change? mentioned healthy weight
bit abdominal-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --fat. CHRIS
PALMER: lost abdominal fat. probably lost 10 pounds process.
everything got normal. went back doctor, shocked.
actually said, hell doing? ANDREW HUBERMAN: time
switched new diet, mental health, don't mind
asking? sound like clear metabolic syndrome
headed towards severe metabolic syndrome. mentioned OCD.
actually familiar this. kid, low level kind Tourette's grunt.
probably me, obsessive still extent-- although not full-blown clinically diagnosed
OCD, can relate somewhat. willing, context
nutritional switch? CHRIS PALMER: nutritional switch,
still struggling low grade depression OCD. Again, wasn't necessarily
interfering ability function functioning high level. Anybody
looking outside, top student. just got one
competitive-- actually, point, competitive residency program
country psychiatry. looked said, fine.
wasn't. actually medications. trying different medications, trying figure
feel better, stop obsessing much, not depressed.
found medications, actually came side effects
benefits. Prozac long time. totally messed sleep.
psychiatrist like, need pills help sleep now. I'm-- just-- like,
doesn't-- not really resonating well me. now psychiatrist.


psychiatry residency. thinking, know what? just not sitting well
going prescribe meds side effects
causing. yet time, wanted feel better. learning
chemical imbalances. get rid depression OCD.
supposed take pills. taking pills. psychotherapy.
psychotherapy off years. received much intensive
treatment younger. essentially worthless me. actually
probably just caused harm end day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Psychoanalysis? CHRIS PALMER: Various psychotherapies-- not psychoanalysis per
se, psychoanalytically-oriented psychotherapies. actually
hospitalized one point. put lithium imipramine, tricyclic
antidepressant, things. actually horrible. horrible.
nothing beneficial me. gave decent amount time work. really
wanted feel better. time tried diet, certainly wasn't impaired
way. wasn't struggling much. was-- still low grade
symptoms, trying feel better. thing striking me,
diet three months, not fact metabolic syndrome gone.
goal, seemingly miraculous achievement got rid
everything one dietary change. thing noticed dramatic
improvement mood, energy, concentration, sleep. I-- first time
life, started waking alarm went off feeling rested. never
happened before. meticulous planning alarm went off
many times push snooze button order time wherever
needed be, whether school hospital whatever. it. good
system. never late anything. shocking me, felt good.
one things often said people, prior diet, always felt like
two types people world. "haves" "have-nots."
happy, peppy people, just positive, got energy.
saying, like work hard play hard. always understood working
hard. totally got hard worker understood value hard
work. got something useful yourself. never understood
hell wants play hard, like got energy that? Aren't tired working
hard? Earth people energy go play hard? assumed
just part "haves" world. just lucky


privileged. either good genetics maybe good childhoods good
parents something-- something didn't have. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kids
genuine smiles yearbooks. CHRIS PALMER: Yes, exactly. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: [LAUGHS] CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whereas,
rest-- way, really appreciate sharing personal story
think important people hear understand people like
yourself, extremely high functioning accomplished, road was--
everything hearing understanding-- choppy internally times,
overcome lot order get there. also, going
sounds like long iterative process trying figure works
doesn't work finally arrive solution, make basis much
work today people. think important think
many people share notion indeed two groups-- happy
group fated-to-be unhappy group. speaks fact that-- story,
rather, speaks fact see not always going internally
people notion just two groups-- happy haves
have-nots-- can't way works, probably many people
suffering realize, important need tools overcome
suffering. really just hear you. Even early discussion, just want extend
genuine thanks much hear people questions health,
mental health, physical health. clearly point fact many
people struggling varying degrees. even people category
great childhood happiness far better

00:20:43 Low-Carb Diets & Anti-Depression, Fasting, Ketosis

also people. thank that. want know.
point realized nutrition can play profound role feel
operate large number domains, still student resident point?
CHRIS PALMER: resident. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point, decide
going explore professional context? CHRIS PALMER: Not yet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. journey forward work
now? CHRIS PALMER: next step just friends family
saw me, saw improved health, saw lost weight pretty easily.


particular, remember sister sister-in-law, got really pissed one
Thanksgiving resist pumpkin pie, apple pie, everything
else. like, hell that? resisting
food? said, don't crave anymore. don't want it, fine. just--
turkey green beans. good enough me. got diet.
noticed dramatic improvement moods, energy, sleep,
everything else. within years, primary thing noticed powerful
antidepressant effect. now, attending physician. got patients
clinical practice treatment resistant mental illness. tertiary care hospital.
almost never get somebody off street first episode depression.
gate, part career, get treatment resistant mental disorders. get
people who've already 6-plus psychiatrists, therapists. usually tried
dozens different medications. decades psychotherapy.
often ECT things. nothing's working. thinking, well, kind
options people. diet really powerful
antidepressant effect. think going try just see patients
game try see might help them. Sure enough, did. Didn't help everyone
not everybody interested and/or able it. ones able
ended remarkable powerful antidepressant effect. One woman
actually became hypomanic within month. depressed pretty much
nonstop five years-- chronically depressed, suicidal, hospitals.
saw become hypomanic. thinking, wow, really powerful
antidepressant effect. amazing. like medication better
actually working her. laid low point because, point, didn't
many clinical trials safety efficacy Atkins diet even weight loss
diabetes, let alone mental disorders. really actually felt like fringe
here. not going met praise anyone. just going lay low.
going offer patients. went along way 2016. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: may just ask diet? say "Atkins diet,"
low zero starch, low carbohydrate diet, certainly low sugar. CHRIS PALMER:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: traditional Atkins? tailoring
individual patient depending psychiatric symptoms, whether not
overweight not overweight? assuming not nutritionist,
prescribe nutrition plan patients? involved making sure


adhered that, maybe even things observed terms
willing try not try this? observations maybe even data? CHRIS
PALMER: early on, winging it. was-- first patients, try
Atkins diet. want see ketosis, going ketones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
pricking finger, blood ketone test? CHRIS
PALMER: didn't know blood ketone monitors existed back then. was--
using urine strips. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not quite accurate
still useful general guide, understand. CHRIS PALMER: True.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. CHRIS PALMER: strongly recommending patients
achieve urinary ketosis. interesting thing noticed pattern,
trying diet not getting ketones, often not get clinical benefit.
got ketosis began notice clinical benefit powerful
antidepressant effect. ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably nutrition plan, a.k.a diet,
elevated ketones urine point say, person
ketosis-- say ketosis-- step right direction,
independent exactly eating not eating get there, including
fasting? time, probably, fasting wasn't popular now. Thanks incredible
work-- think incredible, former colleague. know lot
controversy fasting. think, many people, fasting powerful tool.
others, less useful tool --of Satchin Panda others. fasting certainly will limit
carbohydrate intake get ketosis. Correct? CHRIS PALMER: will.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: patients fast intermittent fasting?
CHRIS PALMER: did. patients Atkins called fat fast,
eat primarily fat. either fast and/or eat primarily fats try get
state ketosis. patients, actually quite easy get ketosis,
especially overweight obese patients. lot fat stores body
actually limiting carbohydrates usually results high levels ketosis them.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably feel better too, imagine,
limit starch intake, start excrete lot water. People can get pretty
quick weight loss even though may not fat loss, makes feel literally little
lighter maybe little energetic. right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
years went on, field advancing, research coming out. People
getting little sophisticated blood ketone monitoring, different


versions

00:27:52 Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet

ketogenic diets. evolving practice. thing completely upended
everything knew psychiatrist, though, helped patient 2016
lose weight. patient, 33-year-old man schizoaffective disorder.
patient eight years now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: clarify
people schizoaffective disorder is? not clinician. recall, like low
level schizophrenia. might auditory hallucinations. met
person, might think kind different, quote unquote, "weird." not
seem necessarily scary typically people. mean
respect, course. oftentimes, people schizophrenia can seem just like--
don't even know interact world seems altered
so-called positive symptoms-- hallucinations,
talking people no one else can see, et cetera. schizoaffective? CHRIS
PALMER: no. schizoaffective schizophrenia essentially.
difference schizophrenia superimposed mood episodes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, actually severe than-- CHRIS PALMER: can be.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. backwards. CHRIS PALMER:
schizoaffective disorder essentially schizophrenia plus mood episodes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah, maybe thinking schizotypal? CHRIS PALMER:
Schizotypal low grade, kind mild paranoia, kind eccentric beliefs,
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Folks there, nomenclature
backwards. Schizotypal the, quote unquote, lower-- "low level" schizophrenia
schizoid-like. Schizoaffective severe. CHRIS PALMER: Full-blown
schizophrenia plus full-blown usually bipolarism. ANDREW HUBERMAN: now,
absolutely clear clinician room is. [LAUGHTER] Thank
reminder. CHRIS PALMER: No worries. man schizoaffective disorder.
daily auditory hallucinations. paranoid delusions. not go
public without terrified. convinced powerful families,
technologies control thoughts. broadcast
thoughts people. trying hurt him. targeted
reason. wasn't quite sure why. suspicions beliefs maybe


bad thing 11 years old, decided target
him. man tormented illness, tormented. ruined life. already
tried 17 different medications, none stopped symptoms.
cause gain lot weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: medications,
recall, schizophrenia-- classical ones dopamine receptor blockers-- caused
people to-- huge increases prolactin. sometimes men-- CHRIS PALMER:
Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --will get breast development. put lot
weight. catatonic-- movement disorders. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: make feel like-- imagine, given good
things release dopamine make us feel, blocking dopamine receptors
antipsychotics makes people feel lousy. CHRIS PALMER: Horrible. huge
challenge field lot patients don't want take them. get
rebound effects. patients several months, stop
cold turkey, can get wildly psychotic ill, end aggressive hospitalized
sometimes dead. him. weighs 340 pounds. whatever reason,
gets head, never going get girlfriend don't lose weight. also
recognizes, never going get girlfriend loser. schizophrenic.
live father. nothing going me. least try address one
awful, horrible things myself. maybe lose weight.
asked help. variety reasons, ended deciding try ketogenic
diet. Now, point, no anticipation ketogenic diet going
anything psychiatric symptoms man schizoaffective disorder.
not depression. Depression different. totally different disorders.
decides give try. Within two weeks, not start losing weight,
begin notice dramatic antidepressant effect. making better eye contact.
smiling more. talking lot more. thinking like, gotten you?
coming life. Like you're-- never heard talk much. never seen
excited present alive. haven't changed meds all. thing upended
everything knew psychiatrist six eight weeks in, spontaneously
starts reporting, know, voices hear time? going away.
says, know always thought families
controlling thoughts get me, targeted me? thinking,
oh, yeah. talking eight years. can talk again.
says, know what? Now think it, don't think true. now


say it, sounds kind crazy. probably never was. probably schizophrenia
along like everybody's trying tell me. think going away. man went
on-- now lost 160 pounds kept off day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
CHRIS PALMER: able things not able since time
diagnosis. able complete certificate program. able go
public not paranoid. performed improv front live audience. at? One
point, able move father's home live independently.
completely blew mind psychiatrist. went scientific journey
understand hell just happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: indeed mind-
blowing. like take quick break acknowledge

00:35:38 Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3/K2. couple
questions. First all, stay kind antipsychotic medication? so,
dosages adjusted, excuse me, undergoing remarkable transition?


know, not either medication nutrition changes, can both.
question one adherence. think someone
schizoaffective disorder, suffering sorts things described.
somebody like organize order stay ketogenic diet?
say seriousness world. think lot people
not schizotypal schizoaffective disorder trouble, claim,
adhering ketogenic diet. not easiest diet. Certainly extreme form first,
not easiest diet stick to. it? sounds like remarkable
individual. also like just know general thoughts adherence things
people back heels mentally. get motivated stick
something? questions were, medication, yes no? yes, dosage adjusted, yes
no. people suffering depression full-blown psychotic episodes,
one ensure continue adhere diet? CHRIS PALMER: terms
medications, remained medication. early on, wasn't adjusting anything.
just disbelief shock happening. didn't know going on.
years, slowly surely tried taper off meds.
meds decades. started medications young child. brain
developed response sorts psychiatric medications. not easy
try get off. continue try get off medication. challenging
difficult. just want say listeners, is-- getting off meds
difficult dangerous. need supervision, mental health
professional prescriber dangerous. people reduce meds
much, can get wildly symptomatic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true
depression well? CHRIS PALMER: true psychiatric medication. brain
makes adaptations response psychiatric medications. stop cold
turkey-- people fine. wouldn't recommend finding seen
patients-- stop antidepressants, seen patients get flooredly depressed
suicidal within three months. one patient, almost quit job
became convinced that, well, life sucks, boss. know
just horrible human being. abusing me. like, whoa,
whoa, whoa. think related medication change. got back
meds, within three days, said, oh god, can't believe happened. almost quit
job. illogical irrational decision ever
made entire life. somehow, seemed real just several days ago. now


back medication-- doesn't mean needs meds.
doesn't mean needs meds. means meds need adjusted
safely, cautiously, gradually. medication piece. adherence
piece not easy patients. rare patient
can say, ketogenic diet. Come see 3 months, let know
going. almost never happens. happened, think, two occasions.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is, understand correctly, what-- perhaps not you--
many psychiatrists medication. It's, prescription. talk in--
CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a month three months. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: variable probably worth us
exploring little bit conversation continues. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: frequent contact making micro adjustments macro
adjustments medication nutrition, meaningful. CHRIS PALMER:
Absolutely. particular patient, early on, actually pretty adherent.
seeing week. lot education. weighing him.
checking ketones. checking glucose levels. point, blood
ketone monitor office. knew whether compliant not,
beneficial clinical work research diet. diet within
seconds, can objective biomarker compliance noncompliance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: key point again, brings mind, me, parallel
medication. patient can say taking medication, unless
hospital setting, somebody's checking tongue this,
well not taking taking more. know blood draws
neurotransmitter levels complicated want know brain
functional brain. imagine people
prescribed drugs number different psychiatric conditions not giving blood
every time talk psychiatrist psychologist. No? CHRIS PALMER: No.
front, looked studies compliance, majority patients
least somewhat noncompliant prescription medications. not purpose.
forgot. take night. late. off routine. forgot
brush teeth-- take meds.
late, just crashed got home. forgot take meds. Happens
time. medication people take day,
noncompliance rates much higher just easy forget. not


people willfully disobeying doctors anything else.

00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits

just hard remember take meds consistently every day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
say measuring ketones, want drill little bit seem
presence ketones somebody being, quote unquote, "in ketosis," turns
key variable. Certainly, book, one major takeaways--
although many important takeaways-- people get ketosis.
stay ketosis? instance, followed the-- don't longer.
tried, past, so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, every third fourth day, get
pasta, rice, et cetera. interesting experiment. stay
ketosis, sort blood levels ketones like see patients?
range think people aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: really
depends patient treating, quite honestly. don't think every
patient needs ketogenic diet. patients, simply getting rid junk food can
make huge difference mood disorder, instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
junk food, meaning, highly processed food, food last shelf long
time. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods usually high sugar,
carbohydrate, carbs, fats. seem worst foods. combination-
- high sugar, high fat-- seems worst combination metabolic health. lo
behold, got emerging data suggests, strongly suggests, also bad
mental health. Depression anxiety common mental disorders.
best data disorders. actually lot data
even bipolar disorder schizophrenia insulin resistance, particular, insulin
signaling brain impaired people chronic mental disorders kind across
board-- way chronic anxiety, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia,
even Alzheimer's disease. know patients disorders
impaired glucose metabolism insulin signaling system brain,
different insulin signaling periphery, seems somehow possibly playing
role. step back that, patients, might just want decrease
glucose insulin levels. can getting rid sweets. patients,
like patients schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder, especially
chronic, using brain treatment, want ketogenic diet.


usually want reasonably high levels blood ketones. Usually, depression, want
see least greater probably 0.8 minimal. psychotic disorders bipolar
disorder, usually want see levels greater 1.5. shooting for,
possible. yeah, think go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
sorry, didn't mean imply people need ketosis order see
mental health benefits changing diet. make clear book--
go detail-- avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin
resistance, essentially trying reverse earlier described metabolic
syndrome, bunch different things, target. people,
getting rid highly processed foods focusing mainly nonprocessed minimally
processed foods will really help. others, going straight full-blown ketogenic diet
will benefit. like back little bit history

00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment

get something find incredibly interesting, epilepsy
longstanding use ketogenic diet fasting treat epilepsy. reason want
kind rewind point history that, think lot listeners people
familiar changing diet changing exercise can
positively impact sleep weight things, cascades feeling
better-- makes perfect sense. lot world still, idea changing
using nutrition dissection tool treatment tool understand treat mental
illness, still kind heretical idea, them, kind falls the, OK, well,
like woo science something like that. Now, obviously board-certified
physician psychiatrist arguably one finest medical schools world,
Harvard Medical School. Even though Stanford side, acknowledge--
acknowledge East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: Harvard-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Stanford East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: argument go back forth number times.
serious clinician serious scientist. serious thinker.
lot people there, notion using diet, immediately think, ah, well,
makes perfect sense. think category people think, well, yeah, didn't


Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.

chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,

highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way

highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way

people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, brave

psychiatry residency. thinking, know what? just not sitting well
going prescribe meds side effects
causing. yet time, wanted feel better. learning
chemical imbalances. get rid depression OCD.
supposed take pills. taking pills. psychotherapy.
psychotherapy off years. received much intensive
treatment younger. essentially worthless me. actually
probably just caused harm end day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Psychoanalysis? CHRIS PALMER: Various psychotherapies-- not psychoanalysis per
se, psychoanalytically-oriented psychotherapies. actually
hospitalized one point. put lithium imipramine, tricyclic
antidepressant, things. actually horrible. horrible.
nothing beneficial me. gave decent amount time work. really
wanted feel better. time tried diet, certainly wasn't impaired
way. wasn't struggling much. was-- still low grade
symptoms, trying feel better. thing striking me,
diet three months, not fact metabolic syndrome gone.
goal, seemingly miraculous achievement got rid
everything one dietary change. thing noticed dramatic
improvement mood, energy, concentration, sleep. I-- first time
life, started waking alarm went off feeling rested. never
happened before. meticulous planning alarm went off
many times push snooze button order time wherever
needed be, whether school hospital whatever. it. good
system. never late anything. shocking me, felt good.
one things often said people, prior diet, always felt like
two types people world. "haves" "have-nots."
happy, peppy people, just positive, got energy.
saying, like work hard play hard. always understood working
hard. totally got hard worker understood value hard
work. got something useful yourself. never understood
hell wants play hard, like got energy that? Aren't tired working
hard? Earth people energy go play hard? assumed
just part "haves" world. just lucky


privileged. either good genetics maybe good childhoods good
parents something-- something didn't have. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kids
genuine smiles yearbooks. CHRIS PALMER: Yes, exactly. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: [LAUGHS] CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whereas,
rest-- way, really appreciate sharing personal story
think important people hear understand people like
yourself, extremely high functioning accomplished, road was--
everything hearing understanding-- choppy internally times,
overcome lot order get there. also, going
sounds like long iterative process trying figure works
doesn't work finally arrive solution, make basis much
work today people. think important think
many people share notion indeed two groups-- happy
group fated-to-be unhappy group. speaks fact that-- story,
rather, speaks fact see not always going internally
people notion just two groups-- happy haves
have-nots-- can't way works, probably many people
suffering realize, important need tools overcome
suffering. really just hear you. Even early discussion, just want extend
genuine thanks much hear people questions health,
mental health, physical health. clearly point fact many
people struggling varying degrees. even people category
great childhood happiness far better

00:20:43 Low-Carb Diets & Anti-Depression, Fasting, Ketosis

also people. thank that. want know.
point realized nutrition can play profound role feel
operate large number domains, still student resident point?
CHRIS PALMER: resident. ANDREW HUBERMAN: point, decide
going explore professional context? CHRIS PALMER: Not yet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. journey forward work
now? CHRIS PALMER: next step just friends family
saw me, saw improved health, saw lost weight pretty easily.


particular, remember sister sister-in-law, got really pissed one
Thanksgiving resist pumpkin pie, apple pie, everything
else. like, hell that? resisting
food? said, don't crave anymore. don't want it, fine. just--
turkey green beans. good enough me. got diet.
noticed dramatic improvement moods, energy, sleep,
everything else. within years, primary thing noticed powerful
antidepressant effect. now, attending physician. got patients
clinical practice treatment resistant mental illness. tertiary care hospital.
almost never get somebody off street first episode depression.
gate, part career, get treatment resistant mental disorders. get
people who've already 6-plus psychiatrists, therapists. usually tried
dozens different medications. decades psychotherapy.
often ECT things. nothing's working. thinking, well, kind
options people. diet really powerful
antidepressant effect. think going try just see patients
game try see might help them. Sure enough, did. Didn't help everyone
not everybody interested and/or able it. ones able
ended remarkable powerful antidepressant effect. One woman
actually became hypomanic within month. depressed pretty much
nonstop five years-- chronically depressed, suicidal, hospitals.
saw become hypomanic. thinking, wow, really powerful
antidepressant effect. amazing. like medication better
actually working her. laid low point because, point, didn't
many clinical trials safety efficacy Atkins diet even weight loss
diabetes, let alone mental disorders. really actually felt like fringe
here. not going met praise anyone. just going lay low.
going offer patients. went along way 2016. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: may just ask diet? say "Atkins diet,"
low zero starch, low carbohydrate diet, certainly low sugar. CHRIS PALMER:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: traditional Atkins? tailoring
individual patient depending psychiatric symptoms, whether not
overweight not overweight? assuming not nutritionist,
prescribe nutrition plan patients? involved making sure


adhered that, maybe even things observed terms
willing try not try this? observations maybe even data? CHRIS
PALMER: early on, winging it. was-- first patients, try
Atkins diet. want see ketosis, going ketones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
pricking finger, blood ketone test? CHRIS
PALMER: didn't know blood ketone monitors existed back then. was--
using urine strips. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not quite accurate
still useful general guide, understand. CHRIS PALMER: True.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. CHRIS PALMER: strongly recommending patients
achieve urinary ketosis. interesting thing noticed pattern,
trying diet not getting ketones, often not get clinical benefit.
got ketosis began notice clinical benefit powerful
antidepressant effect. ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably nutrition plan, a.k.a diet,
elevated ketones urine point say, person
ketosis-- say ketosis-- step right direction,
independent exactly eating not eating get there, including
fasting? time, probably, fasting wasn't popular now. Thanks incredible
work-- think incredible, former colleague. know lot
controversy fasting. think, many people, fasting powerful tool.
others, less useful tool --of Satchin Panda others. fasting certainly will limit
carbohydrate intake get ketosis. Correct? CHRIS PALMER: will.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: patients fast intermittent fasting?
CHRIS PALMER: did. patients Atkins called fat fast,
eat primarily fat. either fast and/or eat primarily fats try get
state ketosis. patients, actually quite easy get ketosis,
especially overweight obese patients. lot fat stores body
actually limiting carbohydrates usually results high levels ketosis them.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably feel better too, imagine,
limit starch intake, start excrete lot water. People can get pretty
quick weight loss even though may not fat loss, makes feel literally little
lighter maybe little energetic. right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
years went on, field advancing, research coming out. People
getting little sophisticated blood ketone monitoring, different


versions

00:27:52 Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet

ketogenic diets. evolving practice. thing completely upended
everything knew psychiatrist, though, helped patient 2016
lose weight. patient, 33-year-old man schizoaffective disorder.
patient eight years now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: clarify
people schizoaffective disorder is? not clinician. recall, like low
level schizophrenia. might auditory hallucinations. met
person, might think kind different, quote unquote, "weird." not
seem necessarily scary typically people. mean
respect, course. oftentimes, people schizophrenia can seem just like--
don't even know interact world seems altered
so-called positive symptoms-- hallucinations,
talking people no one else can see, et cetera. schizoaffective? CHRIS
PALMER: no. schizoaffective schizophrenia essentially.
difference schizophrenia superimposed mood episodes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, actually severe than-- CHRIS PALMER: can be.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. backwards. CHRIS PALMER:
schizoaffective disorder essentially schizophrenia plus mood episodes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah, maybe thinking schizotypal? CHRIS PALMER:
Schizotypal low grade, kind mild paranoia, kind eccentric beliefs,
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Folks there, nomenclature
backwards. Schizotypal the, quote unquote, lower-- "low level" schizophrenia
schizoid-like. Schizoaffective severe. CHRIS PALMER: Full-blown
schizophrenia plus full-blown usually bipolarism. ANDREW HUBERMAN: now,
absolutely clear clinician room is. [LAUGHTER] Thank
reminder. CHRIS PALMER: No worries. man schizoaffective disorder.
daily auditory hallucinations. paranoid delusions. not go
public without terrified. convinced powerful families,
technologies control thoughts. broadcast
thoughts people. trying hurt him. targeted
reason. wasn't quite sure why. suspicions beliefs maybe


bad thing 11 years old, decided target
him. man tormented illness, tormented. ruined life. already
tried 17 different medications, none stopped symptoms.
cause gain lot weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: medications,
recall, schizophrenia-- classical ones dopamine receptor blockers-- caused
people to-- huge increases prolactin. sometimes men-- CHRIS PALMER:
Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --will get breast development. put lot
weight. catatonic-- movement disorders. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: make feel like-- imagine, given good
things release dopamine make us feel, blocking dopamine receptors
antipsychotics makes people feel lousy. CHRIS PALMER: Horrible. huge
challenge field lot patients don't want take them. get
rebound effects. patients several months, stop
cold turkey, can get wildly psychotic ill, end aggressive hospitalized
sometimes dead. him. weighs 340 pounds. whatever reason,
gets head, never going get girlfriend don't lose weight. also
recognizes, never going get girlfriend loser. schizophrenic.
live father. nothing going me. least try address one
awful, horrible things myself. maybe lose weight.
asked help. variety reasons, ended deciding try ketogenic
diet. Now, point, no anticipation ketogenic diet going
anything psychiatric symptoms man schizoaffective disorder.
not depression. Depression different. totally different disorders.
decides give try. Within two weeks, not start losing weight,
begin notice dramatic antidepressant effect. making better eye contact.
smiling more. talking lot more. thinking like, gotten you?
coming life. Like you're-- never heard talk much. never seen
excited present alive. haven't changed meds all. thing upended
everything knew psychiatrist six eight weeks in, spontaneously
starts reporting, know, voices hear time? going away.
says, know always thought families
controlling thoughts get me, targeted me? thinking,
oh, yeah. talking eight years. can talk again.
says, know what? Now think it, don't think true. now


say it, sounds kind crazy. probably never was. probably schizophrenia
along like everybody's trying tell me. think going away. man went
on-- now lost 160 pounds kept off day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
CHRIS PALMER: able things not able since time
diagnosis. able complete certificate program. able go
public not paranoid. performed improv front live audience. at? One
point, able move father's home live independently.
completely blew mind psychiatrist. went scientific journey
understand hell just happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: indeed mind-
blowing. like take quick break acknowledge

00:35:38 Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3/K2. couple
questions. First all, stay kind antipsychotic medication? so,
dosages adjusted, excuse me, undergoing remarkable transition?


know, not either medication nutrition changes, can both.
question one adherence. think someone
schizoaffective disorder, suffering sorts things described.
somebody like organize order stay ketogenic diet?
say seriousness world. think lot people
not schizotypal schizoaffective disorder trouble, claim,
adhering ketogenic diet. not easiest diet. Certainly extreme form first,
not easiest diet stick to. it? sounds like remarkable
individual. also like just know general thoughts adherence things
people back heels mentally. get motivated stick
something? questions were, medication, yes no? yes, dosage adjusted, yes
no. people suffering depression full-blown psychotic episodes,
one ensure continue adhere diet? CHRIS PALMER: terms
medications, remained medication. early on, wasn't adjusting anything.
just disbelief shock happening. didn't know going on.
years, slowly surely tried taper off meds.
meds decades. started medications young child. brain
developed response sorts psychiatric medications. not easy
try get off. continue try get off medication. challenging
difficult. just want say listeners, is-- getting off meds
difficult dangerous. need supervision, mental health
professional prescriber dangerous. people reduce meds
much, can get wildly symptomatic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true
depression well? CHRIS PALMER: true psychiatric medication. brain
makes adaptations response psychiatric medications. stop cold
turkey-- people fine. wouldn't recommend finding seen
patients-- stop antidepressants, seen patients get flooredly depressed
suicidal within three months. one patient, almost quit job
became convinced that, well, life sucks, boss. know
just horrible human being. abusing me. like, whoa,
whoa, whoa. think related medication change. got back
meds, within three days, said, oh god, can't believe happened. almost quit
job. illogical irrational decision ever
made entire life. somehow, seemed real just several days ago. now


back medication-- doesn't mean needs meds.
doesn't mean needs meds. means meds need adjusted
safely, cautiously, gradually. medication piece. adherence
piece not easy patients. rare patient
can say, ketogenic diet. Come see 3 months, let know
going. almost never happens. happened, think, two occasions.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is, understand correctly, what-- perhaps not you--
many psychiatrists medication. It's, prescription. talk in--
CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a month three months. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: variable probably worth us
exploring little bit conversation continues. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: frequent contact making micro adjustments macro
adjustments medication nutrition, meaningful. CHRIS PALMER:
Absolutely. particular patient, early on, actually pretty adherent.
seeing week. lot education. weighing him.
checking ketones. checking glucose levels. point, blood
ketone monitor office. knew whether compliant not,
beneficial clinical work research diet. diet within
seconds, can objective biomarker compliance noncompliance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: key point again, brings mind, me, parallel
medication. patient can say taking medication, unless
hospital setting, somebody's checking tongue this,
well not taking taking more. know blood draws
neurotransmitter levels complicated want know brain
functional brain. imagine people
prescribed drugs number different psychiatric conditions not giving blood
every time talk psychiatrist psychologist. No? CHRIS PALMER: No.
front, looked studies compliance, majority patients
least somewhat noncompliant prescription medications. not purpose.
forgot. take night. late. off routine. forgot
brush teeth-- take meds.
late, just crashed got home. forgot take meds. Happens
time. medication people take day,
noncompliance rates much higher just easy forget. not


people willfully disobeying doctors anything else.

00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits

just hard remember take meds consistently every day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
say measuring ketones, want drill little bit seem
presence ketones somebody being, quote unquote, "in ketosis," turns
key variable. Certainly, book, one major takeaways--
although many important takeaways-- people get ketosis.
stay ketosis? instance, followed the-- don't longer.
tried, past, so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, every third fourth day, get
pasta, rice, et cetera. interesting experiment. stay
ketosis, sort blood levels ketones like see patients?
range think people aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: really
depends patient treating, quite honestly. don't think every
patient needs ketogenic diet. patients, simply getting rid junk food can
make huge difference mood disorder, instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
junk food, meaning, highly processed food, food last shelf long
time. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods usually high sugar,
carbohydrate, carbs, fats. seem worst foods. combination-
- high sugar, high fat-- seems worst combination metabolic health. lo
behold, got emerging data suggests, strongly suggests, also bad
mental health. Depression anxiety common mental disorders.
best data disorders. actually lot data
even bipolar disorder schizophrenia insulin resistance, particular, insulin
signaling brain impaired people chronic mental disorders kind across
board-- way chronic anxiety, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia,
even Alzheimer's disease. know patients disorders
impaired glucose metabolism insulin signaling system brain,
different insulin signaling periphery, seems somehow possibly playing
role. step back that, patients, might just want decrease
glucose insulin levels. can getting rid sweets. patients,
like patients schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder, especially
chronic, using brain treatment, want ketogenic diet.


usually want reasonably high levels blood ketones. Usually, depression, want
see least greater probably 0.8 minimal. psychotic disorders bipolar
disorder, usually want see levels greater 1.5. shooting for,
possible. yeah, think go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
sorry, didn't mean imply people need ketosis order see
mental health benefits changing diet. make clear book--
go detail-- avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin
resistance, essentially trying reverse earlier described metabolic
syndrome, bunch different things, target. people,
getting rid highly processed foods focusing mainly nonprocessed minimally
processed foods will really help. others, going straight full-blown ketogenic diet
will benefit. like back little bit history

00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment

get something find incredibly interesting, epilepsy
longstanding use ketogenic diet fasting treat epilepsy. reason want
kind rewind point history that, think lot listeners people
familiar changing diet changing exercise can
positively impact sleep weight things, cascades feeling
better-- makes perfect sense. lot world still, idea changing
using nutrition dissection tool treatment tool understand treat mental
illness, still kind heretical idea, them, kind falls the, OK, well,
like woo science something like that. Now, obviously board-certified
physician psychiatrist arguably one finest medical schools world,
Harvard Medical School. Even though Stanford side, acknowledge--
acknowledge East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: Harvard-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Stanford East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: argument go back forth number times.
serious clinician serious scientist. serious thinker.
lot people there, notion using diet, immediately think, ah, well,
makes perfect sense. think category people think, well, yeah, didn't


Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary

PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything

just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,

highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,

here. not going met praise anyone. just going lay low.
going offer patients. went along way 2016. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: may just ask diet? say "Atkins diet,"
low zero starch, low carbohydrate diet, certainly low sugar. CHRIS PALMER:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: traditional Atkins? tailoring
individual patient depending psychiatric symptoms, whether not
overweight not overweight? assuming not nutritionist,
prescribe nutrition plan patients? involved making sure


adhered that, maybe even things observed terms
willing try not try this? observations maybe even data? CHRIS
PALMER: early on, winging it. was-- first patients, try
Atkins diet. want see ketosis, going ketones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
pricking finger, blood ketone test? CHRIS
PALMER: didn't know blood ketone monitors existed back then. was--
using urine strips. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not quite accurate
still useful general guide, understand. CHRIS PALMER: True.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. CHRIS PALMER: strongly recommending patients
achieve urinary ketosis. interesting thing noticed pattern,
trying diet not getting ketones, often not get clinical benefit.
got ketosis began notice clinical benefit powerful
antidepressant effect. ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably nutrition plan, a.k.a diet,
elevated ketones urine point say, person
ketosis-- say ketosis-- step right direction,
independent exactly eating not eating get there, including
fasting? time, probably, fasting wasn't popular now. Thanks incredible
work-- think incredible, former colleague. know lot
controversy fasting. think, many people, fasting powerful tool.
others, less useful tool --of Satchin Panda others. fasting certainly will limit
carbohydrate intake get ketosis. Correct? CHRIS PALMER: will.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: patients fast intermittent fasting?
CHRIS PALMER: did. patients Atkins called fat fast,
eat primarily fat. either fast and/or eat primarily fats try get
state ketosis. patients, actually quite easy get ketosis,
especially overweight obese patients. lot fat stores body
actually limiting carbohydrates usually results high levels ketosis them.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably feel better too, imagine,
limit starch intake, start excrete lot water. People can get pretty
quick weight loss even though may not fat loss, makes feel literally little
lighter maybe little energetic. right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
years went on, field advancing, research coming out. People
getting little sophisticated blood ketone monitoring, different


versions

00:27:52 Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet

ketogenic diets. evolving practice. thing completely upended
everything knew psychiatrist, though, helped patient 2016
lose weight. patient, 33-year-old man schizoaffective disorder.
patient eight years now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: clarify
people schizoaffective disorder is? not clinician. recall, like low
level schizophrenia. might auditory hallucinations. met
person, might think kind different, quote unquote, "weird." not
seem necessarily scary typically people. mean
respect, course. oftentimes, people schizophrenia can seem just like--
don't even know interact world seems altered
so-called positive symptoms-- hallucinations,
talking people no one else can see, et cetera. schizoaffective? CHRIS
PALMER: no. schizoaffective schizophrenia essentially.
difference schizophrenia superimposed mood episodes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, actually severe than-- CHRIS PALMER: can be.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. backwards. CHRIS PALMER:
schizoaffective disorder essentially schizophrenia plus mood episodes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah, maybe thinking schizotypal? CHRIS PALMER:
Schizotypal low grade, kind mild paranoia, kind eccentric beliefs,
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Folks there, nomenclature
backwards. Schizotypal the, quote unquote, lower-- "low level" schizophrenia
schizoid-like. Schizoaffective severe. CHRIS PALMER: Full-blown
schizophrenia plus full-blown usually bipolarism. ANDREW HUBERMAN: now,
absolutely clear clinician room is. [LAUGHTER] Thank

ANDREW HUBERMAN: make feel like-- imagine, given good
things release dopamine make us feel, blocking dopamine receptors
antipsychotics makes people feel lousy. CHRIS PALMER: Horrible. huge

oh, yeah. talking eight years. can talk again.
says, know what? Now think it, don't think true. now


say it, sounds kind crazy. probably never was. probably schizophrenia
along like everybody's trying tell me. think going away. man went
on-- now lost 160 pounds kept off day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
CHRIS PALMER: able things not able since time
diagnosis. able complete certificate program. able go

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3/K2. couple
questions. First all, stay kind antipsychotic medication? so,
dosages adjusted, excuse me, undergoing remarkable transition?


know, not either medication nutrition changes, can both.
question one adherence. think someone
schizoaffective disorder, suffering sorts things described.
somebody like organize order stay ketogenic diet?
say seriousness world. think lot people
not schizotypal schizoaffective disorder trouble, claim,
adhering ketogenic diet. not easiest diet. Certainly extreme form first,
not easiest diet stick to. it? sounds like remarkable
individual. also like just know general thoughts adherence things
people back heels mentally. get motivated stick
something? questions were, medication, yes no? yes, dosage adjusted, yes
no. people suffering depression full-blown psychotic episodes,
one ensure continue adhere diet? CHRIS PALMER: terms
medications, remained medication. early on, wasn't adjusting anything.
just disbelief shock happening. didn't know going on.
years, slowly surely tried taper off meds.
meds decades. started medications young child. brain
developed response sorts psychiatric medications. not easy
try get off. continue try get off medication. challenging
difficult. just want say listeners, is-- getting off meds
difficult dangerous. need supervision, mental health
professional prescriber dangerous. people reduce meds
much, can get wildly symptomatic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true
depression well? CHRIS PALMER: true psychiatric medication. brain
makes adaptations response psychiatric medications. stop cold
turkey-- people fine. wouldn't recommend finding seen
patients-- stop antidepressants, seen patients get flooredly depressed
suicidal within three months. one patient, almost quit job
became convinced that, well, life sucks, boss. know
just horrible human being. abusing me. like, whoa,
whoa, whoa. think related medication change. got back
meds, within three days, said, oh god, can't believe happened. almost quit
job. illogical irrational decision ever
made entire life. somehow, seemed real just several days ago. now


back medication-- doesn't mean needs meds.
doesn't mean needs meds. means meds need adjusted
safely, cautiously, gradually. medication piece. adherence
piece not easy patients. rare patient
can say, ketogenic diet. Come see 3 months, let know
going. almost never happens. happened, think, two occasions.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is, understand correctly, what-- perhaps not you--
many psychiatrists medication. It's, prescription. talk in--
CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a month three months. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: variable probably worth us
exploring little bit conversation continues. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: frequent contact making micro adjustments macro
adjustments medication nutrition, meaningful. CHRIS PALMER:
Absolutely. particular patient, early on, actually pretty adherent.
seeing week. lot education. weighing him.
checking ketones. checking glucose levels. point, blood
ketone monitor office. knew whether compliant not,
beneficial clinical work research diet. diet within
seconds, can objective biomarker compliance noncompliance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: key point again, brings mind, me, parallel
medication. patient can say taking medication, unless
hospital setting, somebody's checking tongue this,
well not taking taking more. know blood draws
neurotransmitter levels complicated want know brain
functional brain. imagine people
prescribed drugs number different psychiatric conditions not giving blood
every time talk psychiatrist psychologist. No? CHRIS PALMER: No.
front, looked studies compliance, majority patients
least somewhat noncompliant prescription medications. not purpose.
forgot. take night. late. off routine. forgot
brush teeth-- take meds.
late, just crashed got home. forgot take meds. Happens
time. medication people take day,
noncompliance rates much higher just easy forget. not


people willfully disobeying doctors anything else.

00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits

just hard remember take meds consistently every day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
say measuring ketones, want drill little bit seem
presence ketones somebody being, quote unquote, "in ketosis," turns
key variable. Certainly, book, one major takeaways--
although many important takeaways-- people get ketosis.
stay ketosis? instance, followed the-- don't longer.
tried, past, so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, every third fourth day, get
pasta, rice, et cetera. interesting experiment. stay
ketosis, sort blood levels ketones like see patients?
range think people aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: really
depends patient treating, quite honestly. don't think every
patient needs ketogenic diet. patients, simply getting rid junk food can
make huge difference mood disorder, instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
junk food, meaning, highly processed food, food last shelf long
time. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods usually high sugar,
carbohydrate, carbs, fats. seem worst foods. combination-
- high sugar, high fat-- seems worst combination metabolic health. lo
behold, got emerging data suggests, strongly suggests, also bad
mental health. Depression anxiety common mental disorders.
best data disorders. actually lot data
even bipolar disorder schizophrenia insulin resistance, particular, insulin
signaling brain impaired people chronic mental disorders kind across
board-- way chronic anxiety, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia,
even Alzheimer's disease. know patients disorders
impaired glucose metabolism insulin signaling system brain,
different insulin signaling periphery, seems somehow possibly playing
role. step back that, patients, might just want decrease
glucose insulin levels. can getting rid sweets. patients,
like patients schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder, especially
chronic, using brain treatment, want ketogenic diet.


usually want reasonably high levels blood ketones. Usually, depression, want
see least greater probably 0.8 minimal. psychotic disorders bipolar
disorder, usually want see levels greater 1.5. shooting for,
possible. yeah, think go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
sorry, didn't mean imply people need ketosis order see
mental health benefits changing diet. make clear book--
go detail-- avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin
resistance, essentially trying reverse earlier described metabolic
syndrome, bunch different things, target. people,
getting rid highly processed foods focusing mainly nonprocessed minimally
processed foods will really help. others, going straight full-blown ketogenic diet
will benefit. like back little bit history

00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment

get something find incredibly interesting, epilepsy
longstanding use ketogenic diet fasting treat epilepsy. reason want
kind rewind point history that, think lot listeners people
familiar changing diet changing exercise can
positively impact sleep weight things, cascades feeling
better-- makes perfect sense. lot world still, idea changing
using nutrition dissection tool treatment tool understand treat mental
illness, still kind heretical idea, them, kind falls the, OK, well,
like woo science something like that. Now, obviously board-certified
physician psychiatrist arguably one finest medical schools world,
Harvard Medical School. Even though Stanford side, acknowledge--
acknowledge East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: Harvard-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Stanford East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: argument go back forth number times.
serious clinician serious scientist. serious thinker.
lot people there, notion using diet, immediately think, ah, well,
makes perfect sense. think category people think, well, yeah, didn't


Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something

not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,

rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, brave

particular, remember sister sister-in-law, got really pissed one
Thanksgiving resist pumpkin pie, apple pie, everything
else. like, hell that? resisting
food? said, don't crave anymore. don't want it, fine. just--
turkey green beans. good enough me. got diet.
noticed dramatic improvement moods, energy, sleep,
everything else. within years, primary thing noticed powerful
antidepressant effect. now, attending physician. got patients
clinical practice treatment resistant mental illness. tertiary care hospital.
almost never get somebody off street first episode depression.
gate, part career, get treatment resistant mental disorders. get
people who've already 6-plus psychiatrists, therapists. usually tried
dozens different medications. decades psychotherapy.
often ECT things. nothing's working. thinking, well, kind
options people. diet really powerful
antidepressant effect. think going try just see patients
game try see might help them. Sure enough, did. Didn't help everyone
not everybody interested and/or able it. ones able
ended remarkable powerful antidepressant effect. One woman
actually became hypomanic within month. depressed pretty much
nonstop five years-- chronically depressed, suicidal, hospitals.
saw become hypomanic. thinking, wow, really powerful
antidepressant effect. amazing. like medication better
actually working her. laid low point because, point, didn't
many clinical trials safety efficacy Atkins diet even weight loss
diabetes, let alone mental disorders. really actually felt like fringe
here. not going met praise anyone. just going lay low.
going offer patients. went along way 2016. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: may just ask diet? say "Atkins diet,"
low zero starch, low carbohydrate diet, certainly low sugar. CHRIS PALMER:
Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: traditional Atkins? tailoring
individual patient depending psychiatric symptoms, whether not
overweight not overweight? assuming not nutritionist,
prescribe nutrition plan patients? involved making sure


adhered that, maybe even things observed terms
willing try not try this? observations maybe even data? CHRIS
PALMER: early on, winging it. was-- first patients, try
Atkins diet. want see ketosis, going ketones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
pricking finger, blood ketone test? CHRIS
PALMER: didn't know blood ketone monitors existed back then. was--
using urine strips. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not quite accurate
still useful general guide, understand. CHRIS PALMER: True.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. CHRIS PALMER: strongly recommending patients
achieve urinary ketosis. interesting thing noticed pattern,
trying diet not getting ketones, often not get clinical benefit.
got ketosis began notice clinical benefit powerful
antidepressant effect. ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably nutrition plan, a.k.a diet,
elevated ketones urine point say, person
ketosis-- say ketosis-- step right direction,
independent exactly eating not eating get there, including
fasting? time, probably, fasting wasn't popular now. Thanks incredible
work-- think incredible, former colleague. know lot
controversy fasting. think, many people, fasting powerful tool.
others, less useful tool --of Satchin Panda others. fasting certainly will limit
carbohydrate intake get ketosis. Correct? CHRIS PALMER: will.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: patients fast intermittent fasting?
CHRIS PALMER: did. patients Atkins called fat fast,
eat primarily fat. either fast and/or eat primarily fats try get
state ketosis. patients, actually quite easy get ketosis,
especially overweight obese patients. lot fat stores body
actually limiting carbohydrates usually results high levels ketosis them.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably feel better too, imagine,
limit starch intake, start excrete lot water. People can get pretty
quick weight loss even though may not fat loss, makes feel literally little
lighter maybe little energetic. right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
years went on, field advancing, research coming out. People
getting little sophisticated blood ketone monitoring, different


versions

00:27:52 Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet

ketogenic diets. evolving practice. thing completely upended
everything knew psychiatrist, though, helped patient 2016
lose weight. patient, 33-year-old man schizoaffective disorder.
patient eight years now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: clarify
people schizoaffective disorder is? not clinician. recall, like low
level schizophrenia. might auditory hallucinations. met
person, might think kind different, quote unquote, "weird." not
seem necessarily scary typically people. mean
respect, course. oftentimes, people schizophrenia can seem just like--
don't even know interact world seems altered
so-called positive symptoms-- hallucinations,
talking people no one else can see, et cetera. schizoaffective? CHRIS
PALMER: no. schizoaffective schizophrenia essentially.
difference schizophrenia superimposed mood episodes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, actually severe than-- CHRIS PALMER: can be.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. backwards. CHRIS PALMER:
schizoaffective disorder essentially schizophrenia plus mood episodes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah, maybe thinking schizotypal? CHRIS PALMER:
Schizotypal low grade, kind mild paranoia, kind eccentric beliefs,
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Folks there, nomenclature
backwards. Schizotypal the, quote unquote, lower-- "low level" schizophrenia
schizoid-like. Schizoaffective severe. CHRIS PALMER: Full-blown
schizophrenia plus full-blown usually bipolarism. ANDREW HUBERMAN: now,
absolutely clear clinician room is. [LAUGHTER] Thank
reminder. CHRIS PALMER: No worries. man schizoaffective disorder.
daily auditory hallucinations. paranoid delusions. not go
public without terrified. convinced powerful families,
technologies control thoughts. broadcast
thoughts people. trying hurt him. targeted
reason. wasn't quite sure why. suspicions beliefs maybe


bad thing 11 years old, decided target
him. man tormented illness, tormented. ruined life. already
tried 17 different medications, none stopped symptoms.
cause gain lot weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: medications,
recall, schizophrenia-- classical ones dopamine receptor blockers-- caused
people to-- huge increases prolactin. sometimes men-- CHRIS PALMER:
Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --will get breast development. put lot
weight. catatonic-- movement disorders. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: make feel like-- imagine, given good
things release dopamine make us feel, blocking dopamine receptors
antipsychotics makes people feel lousy. CHRIS PALMER: Horrible. huge
challenge field lot patients don't want take them. get
rebound effects. patients several months, stop
cold turkey, can get wildly psychotic ill, end aggressive hospitalized
sometimes dead. him. weighs 340 pounds. whatever reason,
gets head, never going get girlfriend don't lose weight. also
recognizes, never going get girlfriend loser. schizophrenic.
live father. nothing going me. least try address one
awful, horrible things myself. maybe lose weight.
asked help. variety reasons, ended deciding try ketogenic
diet. Now, point, no anticipation ketogenic diet going
anything psychiatric symptoms man schizoaffective disorder.
not depression. Depression different. totally different disorders.
decides give try. Within two weeks, not start losing weight,
begin notice dramatic antidepressant effect. making better eye contact.
smiling more. talking lot more. thinking like, gotten you?
coming life. Like you're-- never heard talk much. never seen
excited present alive. haven't changed meds all. thing upended
everything knew psychiatrist six eight weeks in, spontaneously
starts reporting, know, voices hear time? going away.
says, know always thought families
controlling thoughts get me, targeted me? thinking,
oh, yeah. talking eight years. can talk again.
says, know what? Now think it, don't think true. now


say it, sounds kind crazy. probably never was. probably schizophrenia
along like everybody's trying tell me. think going away. man went
on-- now lost 160 pounds kept off day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
CHRIS PALMER: able things not able since time
diagnosis. able complete certificate program. able go
public not paranoid. performed improv front live audience. at? One
point, able move father's home live independently.
completely blew mind psychiatrist. went scientific journey
understand hell just happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: indeed mind-

00:35:38 Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3/K2. couple
questions. First all, stay kind antipsychotic medication? so,
dosages adjusted, excuse me, undergoing remarkable transition?


know, not either medication nutrition changes, can both.
question one adherence. think someone
schizoaffective disorder, suffering sorts things described.
somebody like organize order stay ketogenic diet?
say seriousness world. think lot people
not schizotypal schizoaffective disorder trouble, claim,
adhering ketogenic diet. not easiest diet. Certainly extreme form first,
not easiest diet stick to. it? sounds like remarkable
individual. also like just know general thoughts adherence things
people back heels mentally. get motivated stick
something? questions were, medication, yes no? yes, dosage adjusted, yes
no. people suffering depression full-blown psychotic episodes,
one ensure continue adhere diet? CHRIS PALMER: terms
medications, remained medication. early on, wasn't adjusting anything.
just disbelief shock happening. didn't know going on.
years, slowly surely tried taper off meds.
meds decades. started medications young child. brain
developed response sorts psychiatric medications. not easy
try get off. continue try get off medication. challenging
difficult. just want say listeners, is-- getting off meds
difficult dangerous. need supervision, mental health
professional prescriber dangerous. people reduce meds
much, can get wildly symptomatic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true
depression well? CHRIS PALMER: true psychiatric medication. brain
makes adaptations response psychiatric medications. stop cold
turkey-- people fine. wouldn't recommend finding seen
patients-- stop antidepressants, seen patients get flooredly depressed
suicidal within three months. one patient, almost quit job
became convinced that, well, life sucks, boss. know
just horrible human being. abusing me. like, whoa,
whoa, whoa. think related medication change. got back
meds, within three days, said, oh god, can't believe happened. almost quit
job. illogical irrational decision ever
made entire life. somehow, seemed real just several days ago. now


back medication-- doesn't mean needs meds.
doesn't mean needs meds. means meds need adjusted
safely, cautiously, gradually. medication piece. adherence
piece not easy patients. rare patient
can say, ketogenic diet. Come see 3 months, let know
going. almost never happens. happened, think, two occasions.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is, understand correctly, what-- perhaps not you--
many psychiatrists medication. It's, prescription. talk in--
CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a month three months. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: variable probably worth us
exploring little bit conversation continues. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: frequent contact making micro adjustments macro
adjustments medication nutrition, meaningful. CHRIS PALMER:
Absolutely. particular patient, early on, actually pretty adherent.
seeing week. lot education. weighing him.
checking ketones. checking glucose levels. point, blood
ketone monitor office. knew whether compliant not,
beneficial clinical work research diet. diet within
seconds, can objective biomarker compliance noncompliance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: key point again, brings mind, me, parallel
medication. patient can say taking medication, unless
hospital setting, somebody's checking tongue this,
well not taking taking more. know blood draws
neurotransmitter levels complicated want know brain
functional brain. imagine people
prescribed drugs number different psychiatric conditions not giving blood
every time talk psychiatrist psychologist. No? CHRIS PALMER: No.
front, looked studies compliance, majority patients
least somewhat noncompliant prescription medications. not purpose.
forgot. take night. late. off routine. forgot
brush teeth-- take meds.
late, just crashed got home. forgot take meds. Happens
time. medication people take day,
noncompliance rates much higher just easy forget. not


people willfully disobeying doctors anything else.

00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits

just hard remember take meds consistently every day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
say measuring ketones, want drill little bit seem
presence ketones somebody being, quote unquote, "in ketosis," turns
key variable. Certainly, book, one major takeaways--
although many important takeaways-- people get ketosis.
stay ketosis? instance, followed the-- don't longer.
tried, past, so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, every third fourth day, get
pasta, rice, et cetera. interesting experiment. stay
ketosis, sort blood levels ketones like see patients?
range think people aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: really
depends patient treating, quite honestly. don't think every
patient needs ketogenic diet. patients, simply getting rid junk food can
make huge difference mood disorder, instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
junk food, meaning, highly processed food, food last shelf long
time. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods usually high sugar,
carbohydrate, carbs, fats. seem worst foods. combination-
- high sugar, high fat-- seems worst combination metabolic health. lo
behold, got emerging data suggests, strongly suggests, also bad
mental health. Depression anxiety common mental disorders.
best data disorders. actually lot data
even bipolar disorder schizophrenia insulin resistance, particular, insulin
signaling brain impaired people chronic mental disorders kind across
board-- way chronic anxiety, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia,
even Alzheimer's disease. know patients disorders
impaired glucose metabolism insulin signaling system brain,
different insulin signaling periphery, seems somehow possibly playing
role. step back that, patients, might just want decrease
glucose insulin levels. can getting rid sweets. patients,
like patients schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder, especially
chronic, using brain treatment, want ketogenic diet.


usually want reasonably high levels blood ketones. Usually, depression, want
see least greater probably 0.8 minimal. psychotic disorders bipolar
disorder, usually want see levels greater 1.5. shooting for,
possible. yeah, think go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
sorry, didn't mean imply people need ketosis order see
mental health benefits changing diet. make clear book--
go detail-- avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin
resistance, essentially trying reverse earlier described metabolic
syndrome, bunch different things, target. people,
getting rid highly processed foods focusing mainly nonprocessed minimally
processed foods will really help. others, going straight full-blown ketogenic diet
will benefit. like back little bit history

00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment

get something find incredibly interesting, epilepsy
longstanding use ketogenic diet fasting treat epilepsy. reason want
kind rewind point history that, think lot listeners people
familiar changing diet changing exercise can
positively impact sleep weight things, cascades feeling
better-- makes perfect sense. lot world still, idea changing
using nutrition dissection tool treatment tool understand treat mental
illness, still kind heretical idea, them, kind falls the, OK, well,
like woo science something like that. Now, obviously board-certified
physician psychiatrist arguably one finest medical schools world,
Harvard Medical School. Even though Stanford side, acknowledge--
acknowledge East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: Harvard-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Stanford East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: argument go back forth number times.
serious clinician serious scientist. serious thinker.
lot people there, notion using diet, immediately think, ah, well,
makes perfect sense. think category people think, well, yeah, didn't


Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing

adhered that, maybe even things observed terms
willing try not try this? observations maybe even data? CHRIS
PALMER: early on, winging it. was-- first patients, try
Atkins diet. want see ketosis, going ketones. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
pricking finger, blood ketone test? CHRIS
PALMER: didn't know blood ketone monitors existed back then. was--
using urine strips. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not quite accurate
still useful general guide, understand. CHRIS PALMER: True.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. CHRIS PALMER: strongly recommending patients
achieve urinary ketosis. interesting thing noticed pattern,
trying diet not getting ketones, often not get clinical benefit.
got ketosis began notice clinical benefit powerful
antidepressant effect. ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably nutrition plan, a.k.a diet,
elevated ketones urine point say, person
ketosis-- say ketosis-- step right direction,
independent exactly eating not eating get there, including
fasting? time, probably, fasting wasn't popular now. Thanks incredible
work-- think incredible, former colleague. know lot
controversy fasting. think, many people, fasting powerful tool.
others, less useful tool --of Satchin Panda others. fasting certainly will limit
carbohydrate intake get ketosis. Correct? CHRIS PALMER: will.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: patients fast intermittent fasting?
CHRIS PALMER: did. patients Atkins called fat fast,
eat primarily fat. either fast and/or eat primarily fats try get
state ketosis. patients, actually quite easy get ketosis,
especially overweight obese patients. lot fat stores body
actually limiting carbohydrates usually results high levels ketosis them.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: probably feel better too, imagine,
limit starch intake, start excrete lot water. People can get pretty
quick weight loss even though may not fat loss, makes feel literally little
lighter maybe little energetic. right? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
years went on, field advancing, research coming out. People
getting little sophisticated blood ketone monitoring, different


versions

00:27:52 Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet

ketogenic diets. evolving practice. thing completely upended
everything knew psychiatrist, though, helped patient 2016
lose weight. patient, 33-year-old man schizoaffective disorder.
patient eight years now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: clarify
people schizoaffective disorder is? not clinician. recall, like low
level schizophrenia. might auditory hallucinations. met
person, might think kind different, quote unquote, "weird." not
seem necessarily scary typically people. mean
respect, course. oftentimes, people schizophrenia can seem just like--
don't even know interact world seems altered
so-called positive symptoms-- hallucinations,
talking people no one else can see, et cetera. schizoaffective? CHRIS
PALMER: no. schizoaffective schizophrenia essentially.
difference schizophrenia superimposed mood episodes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, actually severe than-- CHRIS PALMER: can be.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. backwards. CHRIS PALMER:
schizoaffective disorder essentially schizophrenia plus mood episodes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah, maybe thinking schizotypal? CHRIS PALMER:
Schizotypal low grade, kind mild paranoia, kind eccentric beliefs,
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Folks there, nomenclature
backwards. Schizotypal the, quote unquote, lower-- "low level" schizophrenia
schizoid-like. Schizoaffective severe. CHRIS PALMER: Full-blown
schizophrenia plus full-blown usually bipolarism. ANDREW HUBERMAN: now,
absolutely clear clinician room is. [LAUGHTER] Thank
reminder. CHRIS PALMER: No worries. man schizoaffective disorder.
daily auditory hallucinations. paranoid delusions. not go
public without terrified. convinced powerful families,
technologies control thoughts. broadcast
thoughts people. trying hurt him. targeted
reason. wasn't quite sure why. suspicions beliefs maybe


bad thing 11 years old, decided target
him. man tormented illness, tormented. ruined life. already
tried 17 different medications, none stopped symptoms.
cause gain lot weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: medications,
recall, schizophrenia-- classical ones dopamine receptor blockers-- caused
people to-- huge increases prolactin. sometimes men-- CHRIS PALMER:
Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --will get breast development. put lot
weight. catatonic-- movement disorders. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: make feel like-- imagine, given good
things release dopamine make us feel, blocking dopamine receptors
antipsychotics makes people feel lousy. CHRIS PALMER: Horrible. huge
challenge field lot patients don't want take them. get
rebound effects. patients several months, stop
cold turkey, can get wildly psychotic ill, end aggressive hospitalized
sometimes dead. him. weighs 340 pounds. whatever reason,
gets head, never going get girlfriend don't lose weight. also
recognizes, never going get girlfriend loser. schizophrenic.
live father. nothing going me. least try address one
awful, horrible things myself. maybe lose weight.
asked help. variety reasons, ended deciding try ketogenic
diet. Now, point, no anticipation ketogenic diet going
anything psychiatric symptoms man schizoaffective disorder.
not depression. Depression different. totally different disorders.
decides give try. Within two weeks, not start losing weight,
begin notice dramatic antidepressant effect. making better eye contact.
smiling more. talking lot more. thinking like, gotten you?
coming life. Like you're-- never heard talk much. never seen
excited present alive. haven't changed meds all. thing upended
everything knew psychiatrist six eight weeks in, spontaneously
starts reporting, know, voices hear time? going away.
says, know always thought families
controlling thoughts get me, targeted me? thinking,
oh, yeah. talking eight years. can talk again.
says, know what? Now think it, don't think true. now


say it, sounds kind crazy. probably never was. probably schizophrenia
along like everybody's trying tell me. think going away. man went
on-- now lost 160 pounds kept off day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
CHRIS PALMER: able things not able since time
diagnosis. able complete certificate program. able go
public not paranoid. performed improv front live audience. at? One
point, able move father's home live independently.
completely blew mind psychiatrist. went scientific journey
understand hell just happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: indeed mind-
blowing. like take quick break acknowledge

00:35:38 Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3/K2. couple
questions. First all, stay kind antipsychotic medication? so,
dosages adjusted, excuse me, undergoing remarkable transition?


know, not either medication nutrition changes, can both.
question one adherence. think someone
schizoaffective disorder, suffering sorts things described.
somebody like organize order stay ketogenic diet?
say seriousness world. think lot people
not schizotypal schizoaffective disorder trouble, claim,
adhering ketogenic diet. not easiest diet. Certainly extreme form first,
not easiest diet stick to. it? sounds like remarkable
individual. also like just know general thoughts adherence things
people back heels mentally. get motivated stick
something? questions were, medication, yes no? yes, dosage adjusted, yes
no. people suffering depression full-blown psychotic episodes,
one ensure continue adhere diet? CHRIS PALMER: terms
medications, remained medication. early on, wasn't adjusting anything.
just disbelief shock happening. didn't know going on.
years, slowly surely tried taper off meds.
meds decades. started medications young child. brain
developed response sorts psychiatric medications. not easy
try get off. continue try get off medication. challenging
difficult. just want say listeners, is-- getting off meds
difficult dangerous. need supervision, mental health
professional prescriber dangerous. people reduce meds
much, can get wildly symptomatic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true
depression well? CHRIS PALMER: true psychiatric medication. brain
makes adaptations response psychiatric medications. stop cold
turkey-- people fine. wouldn't recommend finding seen
patients-- stop antidepressants, seen patients get flooredly depressed
suicidal within three months. one patient, almost quit job
became convinced that, well, life sucks, boss. know
just horrible human being. abusing me. like, whoa,
whoa, whoa. think related medication change. got back
meds, within three days, said, oh god, can't believe happened. almost quit
job. illogical irrational decision ever
made entire life. somehow, seemed real just several days ago. now


back medication-- doesn't mean needs meds.
doesn't mean needs meds. means meds need adjusted
safely, cautiously, gradually. medication piece. adherence
piece not easy patients. rare patient
can say, ketogenic diet. Come see 3 months, let know
going. almost never happens. happened, think, two occasions.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is, understand correctly, what-- perhaps not you--
many psychiatrists medication. It's, prescription. talk in--
CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a month three months. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: variable probably worth us
exploring little bit conversation continues. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: frequent contact making micro adjustments macro
adjustments medication nutrition, meaningful. CHRIS PALMER:
Absolutely. particular patient, early on, actually pretty adherent.
seeing week. lot education. weighing him.
checking ketones. checking glucose levels. point, blood
ketone monitor office. knew whether compliant not,
beneficial clinical work research diet. diet within
seconds, can objective biomarker compliance noncompliance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: key point again, brings mind, me, parallel
medication. patient can say taking medication, unless
hospital setting, somebody's checking tongue this,
well not taking taking more. know blood draws
neurotransmitter levels complicated want know brain
functional brain. imagine people
prescribed drugs number different psychiatric conditions not giving blood
every time talk psychiatrist psychologist. No? CHRIS PALMER: No.
front, looked studies compliance, majority patients
least somewhat noncompliant prescription medications. not purpose.
forgot. take night. late. off routine. forgot
brush teeth-- take meds.
late, just crashed got home. forgot take meds. Happens
time. medication people take day,
noncompliance rates much higher just easy forget. not


people willfully disobeying doctors anything else.

00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits

just hard remember take meds consistently every day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
say measuring ketones, want drill little bit seem
presence ketones somebody being, quote unquote, "in ketosis," turns
key variable. Certainly, book, one major takeaways--
although many important takeaways-- people get ketosis.
stay ketosis? instance, followed the-- don't longer.
tried, past, so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, every third fourth day, get
pasta, rice, et cetera. interesting experiment. stay
ketosis, sort blood levels ketones like see patients?
range think people aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: really
depends patient treating, quite honestly. don't think every
patient needs ketogenic diet. patients, simply getting rid junk food can
make huge difference mood disorder, instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
junk food, meaning, highly processed food, food last shelf long
time. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods usually high sugar,
carbohydrate, carbs, fats. seem worst foods. combination-
- high sugar, high fat-- seems worst combination metabolic health. lo
behold, got emerging data suggests, strongly suggests, also bad
mental health. Depression anxiety common mental disorders.
best data disorders. actually lot data
even bipolar disorder schizophrenia insulin resistance, particular, insulin
signaling brain impaired people chronic mental disorders kind across
board-- way chronic anxiety, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia,
even Alzheimer's disease. know patients disorders
impaired glucose metabolism insulin signaling system brain,
different insulin signaling periphery, seems somehow possibly playing
role. step back that, patients, might just want decrease
glucose insulin levels. can getting rid sweets. patients,
like patients schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder, especially
chronic, using brain treatment, want ketogenic diet.


usually want reasonably high levels blood ketones. Usually, depression, want
see least greater probably 0.8 minimal. psychotic disorders bipolar
disorder, usually want see levels greater 1.5. shooting for,
possible. yeah, think go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
sorry, didn't mean imply people need ketosis order see
mental health benefits changing diet. make clear book--
go detail-- avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin
resistance, essentially trying reverse earlier described metabolic
syndrome, bunch different things, target. people,
getting rid highly processed foods focusing mainly nonprocessed minimally
processed foods will really help. others, going straight full-blown ketogenic diet
will benefit. like back little bit history

00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment

get something find incredibly interesting, epilepsy
longstanding use ketogenic diet fasting treat epilepsy. reason want
kind rewind point history that, think lot listeners people
familiar changing diet changing exercise can
positively impact sleep weight things, cascades feeling
better-- makes perfect sense. lot world still, idea changing
using nutrition dissection tool treatment tool understand treat mental
illness, still kind heretical idea, them, kind falls the, OK, well,
like woo science something like that. Now, obviously board-certified
physician psychiatrist arguably one finest medical schools world,
Harvard Medical School. Even though Stanford side, acknowledge--
acknowledge East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: Harvard-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Stanford East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: argument go back forth number times.
serious clinician serious scientist. serious thinker.
lot people there, notion using diet, immediately think, ah, well,
makes perfect sense. think category people think, well, yeah, didn't


Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW

consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate

00:27:52 Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet

ketogenic diets. evolving practice. thing completely upended
everything knew psychiatrist, though, helped patient 2016
lose weight. patient, 33-year-old man schizoaffective disorder.
patient eight years now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: clarify
people schizoaffective disorder is? not clinician. recall, like low
level schizophrenia. might auditory hallucinations. met
person, might think kind different, quote unquote, "weird." not
seem necessarily scary typically people. mean
respect, course. oftentimes, people schizophrenia can seem just like--
don't even know interact world seems altered
so-called positive symptoms-- hallucinations,
talking people no one else can see, et cetera. schizoaffective? CHRIS
PALMER: no. schizoaffective schizophrenia essentially.
difference schizophrenia superimposed mood episodes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Oh, actually severe than-- CHRIS PALMER: can be.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. backwards. CHRIS PALMER:
schizoaffective disorder essentially schizophrenia plus mood episodes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah, maybe thinking schizotypal? CHRIS PALMER:
Schizotypal low grade, kind mild paranoia, kind eccentric beliefs,
things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Folks there, nomenclature
backwards. Schizotypal the, quote unquote, lower-- "low level" schizophrenia
schizoid-like. Schizoaffective severe. CHRIS PALMER: Full-blown
schizophrenia plus full-blown usually bipolarism. ANDREW HUBERMAN: now,
absolutely clear clinician room is. [LAUGHTER] Thank
reminder. CHRIS PALMER: No worries. man schizoaffective disorder.
daily auditory hallucinations. paranoid delusions. not go
public without terrified. convinced powerful families,
technologies control thoughts. broadcast
thoughts people. trying hurt him. targeted
reason. wasn't quite sure why. suspicions beliefs maybe


bad thing 11 years old, decided target
him. man tormented illness, tormented. ruined life. already
tried 17 different medications, none stopped symptoms.
cause gain lot weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: medications,
recall, schizophrenia-- classical ones dopamine receptor blockers-- caused
people to-- huge increases prolactin. sometimes men-- CHRIS PALMER:
Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --will get breast development. put lot
weight. catatonic-- movement disorders. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: make feel like-- imagine, given good
things release dopamine make us feel, blocking dopamine receptors
antipsychotics makes people feel lousy. CHRIS PALMER: Horrible. huge
challenge field lot patients don't want take them. get
rebound effects. patients several months, stop
cold turkey, can get wildly psychotic ill, end aggressive hospitalized
sometimes dead. him. weighs 340 pounds. whatever reason,
gets head, never going get girlfriend don't lose weight. also
recognizes, never going get girlfriend loser. schizophrenic.
live father. nothing going me. least try address one
awful, horrible things myself. maybe lose weight.
asked help. variety reasons, ended deciding try ketogenic
diet. Now, point, no anticipation ketogenic diet going
anything psychiatric symptoms man schizoaffective disorder.
not depression. Depression different. totally different disorders.
decides give try. Within two weeks, not start losing weight,
begin notice dramatic antidepressant effect. making better eye contact.
smiling more. talking lot more. thinking like, gotten you?
coming life. Like you're-- never heard talk much. never seen
excited present alive. haven't changed meds all. thing upended
everything knew psychiatrist six eight weeks in, spontaneously
starts reporting, know, voices hear time? going away.
says, know always thought families
controlling thoughts get me, targeted me? thinking,
oh, yeah. talking eight years. can talk again.
says, know what? Now think it, don't think true. now


say it, sounds kind crazy. probably never was. probably schizophrenia
along like everybody's trying tell me. think going away. man went
on-- now lost 160 pounds kept off day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
CHRIS PALMER: able things not able since time
diagnosis. able complete certificate program. able go
public not paranoid. performed improv front live audience. at? One
point, able move father's home live independently.
completely blew mind psychiatrist. went scientific journey
understand hell just happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: indeed mind-
blowing. like take quick break acknowledge

00:35:38 Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3/K2. couple
questions. First all, stay kind antipsychotic medication? so,
dosages adjusted, excuse me, undergoing remarkable transition?


know, not either medication nutrition changes, can both.
question one adherence. think someone
schizoaffective disorder, suffering sorts things described.
somebody like organize order stay ketogenic diet?
say seriousness world. think lot people
not schizotypal schizoaffective disorder trouble, claim,
adhering ketogenic diet. not easiest diet. Certainly extreme form first,
not easiest diet stick to. it? sounds like remarkable
individual. also like just know general thoughts adherence things
people back heels mentally. get motivated stick
something? questions were, medication, yes no? yes, dosage adjusted, yes
no. people suffering depression full-blown psychotic episodes,
one ensure continue adhere diet? CHRIS PALMER: terms
medications, remained medication. early on, wasn't adjusting anything.
just disbelief shock happening. didn't know going on.
years, slowly surely tried taper off meds.
meds decades. started medications young child. brain
developed response sorts psychiatric medications. not easy
try get off. continue try get off medication. challenging
difficult. just want say listeners, is-- getting off meds
difficult dangerous. need supervision, mental health
professional prescriber dangerous. people reduce meds
much, can get wildly symptomatic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true
depression well? CHRIS PALMER: true psychiatric medication. brain
makes adaptations response psychiatric medications. stop cold
turkey-- people fine. wouldn't recommend finding seen
patients-- stop antidepressants, seen patients get flooredly depressed
suicidal within three months. one patient, almost quit job
became convinced that, well, life sucks, boss. know
just horrible human being. abusing me. like, whoa,
whoa, whoa. think related medication change. got back
meds, within three days, said, oh god, can't believe happened. almost quit
job. illogical irrational decision ever
made entire life. somehow, seemed real just several days ago. now


back medication-- doesn't mean needs meds.
doesn't mean needs meds. means meds need adjusted
safely, cautiously, gradually. medication piece. adherence
piece not easy patients. rare patient
can say, ketogenic diet. Come see 3 months, let know
going. almost never happens. happened, think, two occasions.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is, understand correctly, what-- perhaps not you--
many psychiatrists medication. It's, prescription. talk in--
CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a month three months. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: variable probably worth us
exploring little bit conversation continues. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: frequent contact making micro adjustments macro
adjustments medication nutrition, meaningful. CHRIS PALMER:
Absolutely. particular patient, early on, actually pretty adherent.
seeing week. lot education. weighing him.
checking ketones. checking glucose levels. point, blood
ketone monitor office. knew whether compliant not,
beneficial clinical work research diet. diet within
seconds, can objective biomarker compliance noncompliance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: key point again, brings mind, me, parallel
medication. patient can say taking medication, unless
hospital setting, somebody's checking tongue this,
well not taking taking more. know blood draws
neurotransmitter levels complicated want know brain
functional brain. imagine people
prescribed drugs number different psychiatric conditions not giving blood
every time talk psychiatrist psychologist. No? CHRIS PALMER: No.
front, looked studies compliance, majority patients
least somewhat noncompliant prescription medications. not purpose.
forgot. take night. late. off routine. forgot
brush teeth-- take meds.
late, just crashed got home. forgot take meds. Happens
time. medication people take day,
noncompliance rates much higher just easy forget. not


people willfully disobeying doctors anything else.

00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits

just hard remember take meds consistently every day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
say measuring ketones, want drill little bit seem
presence ketones somebody being, quote unquote, "in ketosis," turns
key variable. Certainly, book, one major takeaways--
although many important takeaways-- people get ketosis.
stay ketosis? instance, followed the-- don't longer.
tried, past, so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, every third fourth day, get
pasta, rice, et cetera. interesting experiment. stay
ketosis, sort blood levels ketones like see patients?
range think people aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: really
depends patient treating, quite honestly. don't think every
patient needs ketogenic diet. patients, simply getting rid junk food can
make huge difference mood disorder, instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
junk food, meaning, highly processed food, food last shelf long
time. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods usually high sugar,
carbohydrate, carbs, fats. seem worst foods. combination-
- high sugar, high fat-- seems worst combination metabolic health. lo
behold, got emerging data suggests, strongly suggests, also bad
mental health. Depression anxiety common mental disorders.
best data disorders. actually lot data
even bipolar disorder schizophrenia insulin resistance, particular, insulin
signaling brain impaired people chronic mental disorders kind across
board-- way chronic anxiety, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia,
even Alzheimer's disease. know patients disorders
impaired glucose metabolism insulin signaling system brain,
different insulin signaling periphery, seems somehow possibly playing
role. step back that, patients, might just want decrease
glucose insulin levels. can getting rid sweets. patients,
like patients schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder, especially
chronic, using brain treatment, want ketogenic diet.


usually want reasonably high levels blood ketones. Usually, depression, want
see least greater probably 0.8 minimal. psychotic disorders bipolar
disorder, usually want see levels greater 1.5. shooting for,
possible. yeah, think go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
sorry, didn't mean imply people need ketosis order see
mental health benefits changing diet. make clear book--
go detail-- avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin
resistance, essentially trying reverse earlier described metabolic
syndrome, bunch different things, target. people,
getting rid highly processed foods focusing mainly nonprocessed minimally
processed foods will really help. others, going straight full-blown ketogenic diet
will benefit. like back little bit history

00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment

get something find incredibly interesting, epilepsy
longstanding use ketogenic diet fasting treat epilepsy. reason want
kind rewind point history that, think lot listeners people
familiar changing diet changing exercise can
positively impact sleep weight things, cascades feeling
better-- makes perfect sense. lot world still, idea changing
using nutrition dissection tool treatment tool understand treat mental
illness, still kind heretical idea, them, kind falls the, OK, well,
like woo science something like that. Now, obviously board-certified
physician psychiatrist arguably one finest medical schools world,
Harvard Medical School. Even though Stanford side, acknowledge--
acknowledge East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: Harvard-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Stanford East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: argument go back forth number times.
serious clinician serious scientist. serious thinker.
lot people there, notion using diet, immediately think, ah, well,
makes perfect sense. think category people think, well, yeah, didn't


Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.

highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,

00:35:38 Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3/K2. couple
questions. First all, stay kind antipsychotic medication? so,
dosages adjusted, excuse me, undergoing remarkable transition?


know, not either medication nutrition changes, can both.
question one adherence. think someone
schizoaffective disorder, suffering sorts things described.
somebody like organize order stay ketogenic diet?
say seriousness world. think lot people
not schizotypal schizoaffective disorder trouble, claim,
adhering ketogenic diet. not easiest diet. Certainly extreme form first,
not easiest diet stick to. it? sounds like remarkable
individual. also like just know general thoughts adherence things
people back heels mentally. get motivated stick
something? questions were, medication, yes no? yes, dosage adjusted, yes
no. people suffering depression full-blown psychotic episodes,
one ensure continue adhere diet? CHRIS PALMER: terms
medications, remained medication. early on, wasn't adjusting anything.
just disbelief shock happening. didn't know going on.
years, slowly surely tried taper off meds.
meds decades. started medications young child. brain
developed response sorts psychiatric medications. not easy
try get off. continue try get off medication. challenging
difficult. just want say listeners, is-- getting off meds
difficult dangerous. need supervision, mental health
professional prescriber dangerous. people reduce meds
much, can get wildly symptomatic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true
depression well? CHRIS PALMER: true psychiatric medication. brain
makes adaptations response psychiatric medications. stop cold
turkey-- people fine. wouldn't recommend finding seen
patients-- stop antidepressants, seen patients get flooredly depressed
suicidal within three months. one patient, almost quit job
became convinced that, well, life sucks, boss. know
just horrible human being. abusing me. like, whoa,
whoa, whoa. think related medication change. got back
meds, within three days, said, oh god, can't believe happened. almost quit
job. illogical irrational decision ever
made entire life. somehow, seemed real just several days ago. now


back medication-- doesn't mean needs meds.
doesn't mean needs meds. means meds need adjusted
safely, cautiously, gradually. medication piece. adherence
piece not easy patients. rare patient
can say, ketogenic diet. Come see 3 months, let know
going. almost never happens. happened, think, two occasions.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is, understand correctly, what-- perhaps not you--
many psychiatrists medication. It's, prescription. talk in--
CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a month three months. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: variable probably worth us
exploring little bit conversation continues. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: frequent contact making micro adjustments macro
adjustments medication nutrition, meaningful. CHRIS PALMER:
Absolutely. particular patient, early on, actually pretty adherent.
seeing week. lot education. weighing him.
checking ketones. checking glucose levels. point, blood
ketone monitor office. knew whether compliant not,
beneficial clinical work research diet. diet within
seconds, can objective biomarker compliance noncompliance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: key point again, brings mind, me, parallel
medication. patient can say taking medication, unless
hospital setting, somebody's checking tongue this,
well not taking taking more. know blood draws
neurotransmitter levels complicated want know brain
functional brain. imagine people
prescribed drugs number different psychiatric conditions not giving blood
every time talk psychiatrist psychologist. No? CHRIS PALMER: No.
front, looked studies compliance, majority patients
least somewhat noncompliant prescription medications. not purpose.
forgot. take night. late. off routine. forgot
brush teeth-- take meds.
late, just crashed got home. forgot take meds. Happens
time. medication people take day,
noncompliance rates much higher just easy forget. not


people willfully disobeying doctors anything else.

00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits

just hard remember take meds consistently every day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
say measuring ketones, want drill little bit seem
presence ketones somebody being, quote unquote, "in ketosis," turns
key variable. Certainly, book, one major takeaways--
although many important takeaways-- people get ketosis.
stay ketosis? instance, followed the-- don't longer.
tried, past, so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, every third fourth day, get
pasta, rice, et cetera. interesting experiment. stay
ketosis, sort blood levels ketones like see patients?
range think people aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: really
depends patient treating, quite honestly. don't think every
patient needs ketogenic diet. patients, simply getting rid junk food can
make huge difference mood disorder, instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
junk food, meaning, highly processed food, food last shelf long
time. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods usually high sugar,
carbohydrate, carbs, fats. seem worst foods. combination-
- high sugar, high fat-- seems worst combination metabolic health. lo
behold, got emerging data suggests, strongly suggests, also bad
mental health. Depression anxiety common mental disorders.
best data disorders. actually lot data
even bipolar disorder schizophrenia insulin resistance, particular, insulin
signaling brain impaired people chronic mental disorders kind across
board-- way chronic anxiety, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia,
even Alzheimer's disease. know patients disorders
impaired glucose metabolism insulin signaling system brain,
different insulin signaling periphery, seems somehow possibly playing
role. step back that, patients, might just want decrease
glucose insulin levels. can getting rid sweets. patients,
like patients schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder, especially
chronic, using brain treatment, want ketogenic diet.


usually want reasonably high levels blood ketones. Usually, depression, want
see least greater probably 0.8 minimal. psychotic disorders bipolar
disorder, usually want see levels greater 1.5. shooting for,
possible. yeah, think go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
sorry, didn't mean imply people need ketosis order see
mental health benefits changing diet. make clear book--
go detail-- avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin
resistance, essentially trying reverse earlier described metabolic
syndrome, bunch different things, target. people,
getting rid highly processed foods focusing mainly nonprocessed minimally
processed foods will really help. others, going straight full-blown ketogenic diet
will benefit. like back little bit history

00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment

get something find incredibly interesting, epilepsy
longstanding use ketogenic diet fasting treat epilepsy. reason want
kind rewind point history that, think lot listeners people
familiar changing diet changing exercise can
positively impact sleep weight things, cascades feeling
better-- makes perfect sense. lot world still, idea changing
using nutrition dissection tool treatment tool understand treat mental
illness, still kind heretical idea, them, kind falls the, OK, well,
like woo science something like that. Now, obviously board-certified
physician psychiatrist arguably one finest medical schools world,
Harvard Medical School. Even though Stanford side, acknowledge--
acknowledge East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: Harvard-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Stanford East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: argument go back forth number times.
serious clinician serious scientist. serious thinker.
lot people there, notion using diet, immediately think, ah, well,
makes perfect sense. think category people think, well, yeah, didn't


Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest

one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic

PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series

everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.

even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got

rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,

underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,

00:35:38 Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3/K2. couple
questions. First all, stay kind antipsychotic medication? so,
dosages adjusted, excuse me, undergoing remarkable transition?


know, not either medication nutrition changes, can both.
question one adherence. think someone
schizoaffective disorder, suffering sorts things described.
somebody like organize order stay ketogenic diet?
say seriousness world. think lot people
not schizotypal schizoaffective disorder trouble, claim,
adhering ketogenic diet. not easiest diet. Certainly extreme form first,
not easiest diet stick to. it? sounds like remarkable
individual. also like just know general thoughts adherence things
people back heels mentally. get motivated stick
something? questions were, medication, yes no? yes, dosage adjusted, yes
no. people suffering depression full-blown psychotic episodes,
one ensure continue adhere diet? CHRIS PALMER: terms
medications, remained medication. early on, wasn't adjusting anything.
just disbelief shock happening. didn't know going on.
years, slowly surely tried taper off meds.
meds decades. started medications young child. brain
developed response sorts psychiatric medications. not easy
try get off. continue try get off medication. challenging
difficult. just want say listeners, is-- getting off meds
difficult dangerous. need supervision, mental health
professional prescriber dangerous. people reduce meds
much, can get wildly symptomatic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true
depression well? CHRIS PALMER: true psychiatric medication. brain
makes adaptations response psychiatric medications. stop cold
turkey-- people fine. wouldn't recommend finding seen
patients-- stop antidepressants, seen patients get flooredly depressed
suicidal within three months. one patient, almost quit job
became convinced that, well, life sucks, boss. know
just horrible human being. abusing me. like, whoa,
whoa, whoa. think related medication change. got back
meds, within three days, said, oh god, can't believe happened. almost quit
job. illogical irrational decision ever
made entire life. somehow, seemed real just several days ago. now


back medication-- doesn't mean needs meds.
doesn't mean needs meds. means meds need adjusted
safely, cautiously, gradually. medication piece. adherence
piece not easy patients. rare patient
can say, ketogenic diet. Come see 3 months, let know
going. almost never happens. happened, think, two occasions.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is, understand correctly, what-- perhaps not you--
many psychiatrists medication. It's, prescription. talk in--
CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a month three months. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: variable probably worth us
exploring little bit conversation continues. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: frequent contact making micro adjustments macro
adjustments medication nutrition, meaningful. CHRIS PALMER:
Absolutely. particular patient, early on, actually pretty adherent.
seeing week. lot education. weighing him.
checking ketones. checking glucose levels. point, blood
ketone monitor office. knew whether compliant not,
beneficial clinical work research diet. diet within
seconds, can objective biomarker compliance noncompliance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: key point again, brings mind, me, parallel
medication. patient can say taking medication, unless
hospital setting, somebody's checking tongue this,
well not taking taking more. know blood draws
neurotransmitter levels complicated want know brain
functional brain. imagine people
prescribed drugs number different psychiatric conditions not giving blood
every time talk psychiatrist psychologist. No? CHRIS PALMER: No.
front, looked studies compliance, majority patients
least somewhat noncompliant prescription medications. not purpose.
forgot. take night. late. off routine. forgot
brush teeth-- take meds.
late, just crashed got home. forgot take meds. Happens
time. medication people take day,
noncompliance rates much higher just easy forget. not


people willfully disobeying doctors anything else.

00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits

just hard remember take meds consistently every day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
say measuring ketones, want drill little bit seem
presence ketones somebody being, quote unquote, "in ketosis," turns
key variable. Certainly, book, one major takeaways--
although many important takeaways-- people get ketosis.
stay ketosis? instance, followed the-- don't longer.
tried, past, so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, every third fourth day, get
pasta, rice, et cetera. interesting experiment. stay
ketosis, sort blood levels ketones like see patients?
range think people aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: really
depends patient treating, quite honestly. don't think every
patient needs ketogenic diet. patients, simply getting rid junk food can
make huge difference mood disorder, instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
junk food, meaning, highly processed food, food last shelf long
time. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods usually high sugar,
carbohydrate, carbs, fats. seem worst foods. combination-
- high sugar, high fat-- seems worst combination metabolic health. lo
behold, got emerging data suggests, strongly suggests, also bad
mental health. Depression anxiety common mental disorders.
best data disorders. actually lot data
even bipolar disorder schizophrenia insulin resistance, particular, insulin
signaling brain impaired people chronic mental disorders kind across
board-- way chronic anxiety, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia,
even Alzheimer's disease. know patients disorders
impaired glucose metabolism insulin signaling system brain,
different insulin signaling periphery, seems somehow possibly playing
role. step back that, patients, might just want decrease
glucose insulin levels. can getting rid sweets. patients,
like patients schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder, especially
chronic, using brain treatment, want ketogenic diet.


usually want reasonably high levels blood ketones. Usually, depression, want
see least greater probably 0.8 minimal. psychotic disorders bipolar
disorder, usually want see levels greater 1.5. shooting for,
possible. yeah, think go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
sorry, didn't mean imply people need ketosis order see
mental health benefits changing diet. make clear book--
go detail-- avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin
resistance, essentially trying reverse earlier described metabolic
syndrome, bunch different things, target. people,
getting rid highly processed foods focusing mainly nonprocessed minimally
processed foods will really help. others, going straight full-blown ketogenic diet
will benefit. like back little bit history

00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment

get something find incredibly interesting, epilepsy
longstanding use ketogenic diet fasting treat epilepsy. reason want
kind rewind point history that, think lot listeners people
familiar changing diet changing exercise can
positively impact sleep weight things, cascades feeling
better-- makes perfect sense. lot world still, idea changing
using nutrition dissection tool treatment tool understand treat mental
illness, still kind heretical idea, them, kind falls the, OK, well,
like woo science something like that. Now, obviously board-certified
physician psychiatrist arguably one finest medical schools world,
Harvard Medical School. Even though Stanford side, acknowledge--
acknowledge East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: Harvard-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Stanford East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: argument go back forth number times.
serious clinician serious scientist. serious thinker.
lot people there, notion using diet, immediately think, ah, well,
makes perfect sense. think category people think, well, yeah, didn't


Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW

highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way

highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-

otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking

people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, brave

know, not either medication nutrition changes, can both.
question one adherence. think someone
schizoaffective disorder, suffering sorts things described.
somebody like organize order stay ketogenic diet?
say seriousness world. think lot people
not schizotypal schizoaffective disorder trouble, claim,
adhering ketogenic diet. not easiest diet. Certainly extreme form first,
not easiest diet stick to. it? sounds like remarkable
individual. also like just know general thoughts adherence things
people back heels mentally. get motivated stick
something? questions were, medication, yes no? yes, dosage adjusted, yes
no. people suffering depression full-blown psychotic episodes,
one ensure continue adhere diet? CHRIS PALMER: terms
medications, remained medication. early on, wasn't adjusting anything.
just disbelief shock happening. didn't know going on.
years, slowly surely tried taper off meds.
meds decades. started medications young child. brain
developed response sorts psychiatric medications. not easy
try get off. continue try get off medication. challenging
difficult. just want say listeners, is-- getting off meds
difficult dangerous. need supervision, mental health
professional prescriber dangerous. people reduce meds
much, can get wildly symptomatic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: true
depression well? CHRIS PALMER: true psychiatric medication. brain
makes adaptations response psychiatric medications. stop cold
turkey-- people fine. wouldn't recommend finding seen
patients-- stop antidepressants, seen patients get flooredly depressed
suicidal within three months. one patient, almost quit job
became convinced that, well, life sucks, boss. know
just horrible human being. abusing me. like, whoa,
whoa, whoa. think related medication change. got back
meds, within three days, said, oh god, can't believe happened. almost quit
job. illogical irrational decision ever
made entire life. somehow, seemed real just several days ago. now


back medication-- doesn't mean needs meds.
doesn't mean needs meds. means meds need adjusted
safely, cautiously, gradually. medication piece. adherence
piece not easy patients. rare patient
can say, ketogenic diet. Come see 3 months, let know
going. almost never happens. happened, think, two occasions.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is, understand correctly, what-- perhaps not you--
many psychiatrists medication. It's, prescription. talk in--
CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a month three months. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: variable probably worth us
exploring little bit conversation continues. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: frequent contact making micro adjustments macro
adjustments medication nutrition, meaningful. CHRIS PALMER:
Absolutely. particular patient, early on, actually pretty adherent.
seeing week. lot education. weighing him.
checking ketones. checking glucose levels. point, blood
ketone monitor office. knew whether compliant not,
beneficial clinical work research diet. diet within
seconds, can objective biomarker compliance noncompliance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: key point again, brings mind, me, parallel
medication. patient can say taking medication, unless
hospital setting, somebody's checking tongue this,
well not taking taking more. know blood draws
neurotransmitter levels complicated want know brain
functional brain. imagine people
prescribed drugs number different psychiatric conditions not giving blood
every time talk psychiatrist psychologist. No? CHRIS PALMER: No.
front, looked studies compliance, majority patients
least somewhat noncompliant prescription medications. not purpose.
forgot. take night. late. off routine. forgot
brush teeth-- take meds.
late, just crashed got home. forgot take meds. Happens
time. medication people take day,
noncompliance rates much higher just easy forget. not


people willfully disobeying doctors anything else.

00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits

just hard remember take meds consistently every day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
say measuring ketones, want drill little bit seem
presence ketones somebody being, quote unquote, "in ketosis," turns
key variable. Certainly, book, one major takeaways--
although many important takeaways-- people get ketosis.
stay ketosis? instance, followed the-- don't longer.
tried, past, so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, every third fourth day, get
pasta, rice, et cetera. interesting experiment. stay
ketosis, sort blood levels ketones like see patients?
range think people aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: really
depends patient treating, quite honestly. don't think every
patient needs ketogenic diet. patients, simply getting rid junk food can
make huge difference mood disorder, instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
junk food, meaning, highly processed food, food last shelf long
time. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods usually high sugar,
carbohydrate, carbs, fats. seem worst foods. combination-
- high sugar, high fat-- seems worst combination metabolic health. lo
behold, got emerging data suggests, strongly suggests, also bad
mental health. Depression anxiety common mental disorders.
best data disorders. actually lot data
even bipolar disorder schizophrenia insulin resistance, particular, insulin
signaling brain impaired people chronic mental disorders kind across
board-- way chronic anxiety, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia,
even Alzheimer's disease. know patients disorders
impaired glucose metabolism insulin signaling system brain,
different insulin signaling periphery, seems somehow possibly playing
role. step back that, patients, might just want decrease
glucose insulin levels. can getting rid sweets. patients,
like patients schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder, especially
chronic, using brain treatment, want ketogenic diet.


usually want reasonably high levels blood ketones. Usually, depression, want
see least greater probably 0.8 minimal. psychotic disorders bipolar
disorder, usually want see levels greater 1.5. shooting for,
possible. yeah, think go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
sorry, didn't mean imply people need ketosis order see
mental health benefits changing diet. make clear book--
go detail-- avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin
resistance, essentially trying reverse earlier described metabolic
syndrome, bunch different things, target. people,
getting rid highly processed foods focusing mainly nonprocessed minimally
processed foods will really help. others, going straight full-blown ketogenic diet
will benefit. like back little bit history

00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment

get something find incredibly interesting, epilepsy
longstanding use ketogenic diet fasting treat epilepsy. reason want
kind rewind point history that, think lot listeners people
familiar changing diet changing exercise can
positively impact sleep weight things, cascades feeling
better-- makes perfect sense. lot world still, idea changing
using nutrition dissection tool treatment tool understand treat mental
illness, still kind heretical idea, them, kind falls the, OK, well,
like woo science something like that. Now, obviously board-certified
physician psychiatrist arguably one finest medical schools world,
Harvard Medical School. Even though Stanford side, acknowledge--
acknowledge East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: Harvard-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Stanford East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: argument go back forth number times.
serious clinician serious scientist. serious thinker.
lot people there, notion using diet, immediately think, ah, well,
makes perfect sense. think category people think, well, yeah, didn't


Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman use code Huberman checkout.
Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,

underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

back medication-- doesn't mean needs meds.
doesn't mean needs meds. means meds need adjusted
safely, cautiously, gradually. medication piece. adherence
piece not easy patients. rare patient
can say, ketogenic diet. Come see 3 months, let know
going. almost never happens. happened, think, two occasions.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: is, understand correctly, what-- perhaps not you--
many psychiatrists medication. It's, prescription. talk in--
CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a month three months. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: variable probably worth us
exploring little bit conversation continues. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: frequent contact making micro adjustments macro
adjustments medication nutrition, meaningful. CHRIS PALMER:
Absolutely. particular patient, early on, actually pretty adherent.
seeing week. lot education. weighing him.
checking ketones. checking glucose levels. point, blood
ketone monitor office. knew whether compliant not,
beneficial clinical work research diet. diet within
seconds, can objective biomarker compliance noncompliance. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: key point again, brings mind, me, parallel
medication. patient can say taking medication, unless
hospital setting, somebody's checking tongue this,
well not taking taking more. know blood draws
neurotransmitter levels complicated want know brain
functional brain. imagine people
prescribed drugs number different psychiatric conditions not giving blood
every time talk psychiatrist psychologist. No? CHRIS PALMER: No.
front, looked studies compliance, majority patients
least somewhat noncompliant prescription medications. not purpose.
forgot. take night. late. off routine. forgot
brush teeth-- take meds.
late, just crashed got home. forgot take meds. Happens
time. medication people take day,
noncompliance rates much higher just easy forget. not


people willfully disobeying doctors anything else.

00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits

just hard remember take meds consistently every day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
say measuring ketones, want drill little bit seem
presence ketones somebody being, quote unquote, "in ketosis," turns
key variable. Certainly, book, one major takeaways--
although many important takeaways-- people get ketosis.
stay ketosis? instance, followed the-- don't longer.
tried, past, so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, every third fourth day, get
pasta, rice, et cetera. interesting experiment. stay
ketosis, sort blood levels ketones like see patients?
range think people aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: really
depends patient treating, quite honestly. don't think every
patient needs ketogenic diet. patients, simply getting rid junk food can
make huge difference mood disorder, instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
junk food, meaning, highly processed food, food last shelf long
time. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods usually high sugar,
carbohydrate, carbs, fats. seem worst foods. combination-
- high sugar, high fat-- seems worst combination metabolic health. lo
behold, got emerging data suggests, strongly suggests, also bad
mental health. Depression anxiety common mental disorders.
best data disorders. actually lot data
even bipolar disorder schizophrenia insulin resistance, particular, insulin
signaling brain impaired people chronic mental disorders kind across
board-- way chronic anxiety, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia,
even Alzheimer's disease. know patients disorders
impaired glucose metabolism insulin signaling system brain,
different insulin signaling periphery, seems somehow possibly playing
role. step back that, patients, might just want decrease
glucose insulin levels. can getting rid sweets. patients,
like patients schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder, especially
chronic, using brain treatment, want ketogenic diet.


usually want reasonably high levels blood ketones. Usually, depression, want
see least greater probably 0.8 minimal. psychotic disorders bipolar
disorder, usually want see levels greater 1.5. shooting for,
possible. yeah, think go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
sorry, didn't mean imply people need ketosis order see
mental health benefits changing diet. make clear book--
go detail-- avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin
resistance, essentially trying reverse earlier described metabolic
syndrome, bunch different things, target. people,
getting rid highly processed foods focusing mainly nonprocessed minimally
processed foods will really help. others, going straight full-blown ketogenic diet
will benefit. like back little bit history

00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment

get something find incredibly interesting, epilepsy
longstanding use ketogenic diet fasting treat epilepsy. reason want
kind rewind point history that, think lot listeners people
familiar changing diet changing exercise can
positively impact sleep weight things, cascades feeling
better-- makes perfect sense. lot world still, idea changing
using nutrition dissection tool treatment tool understand treat mental
illness, still kind heretical idea, them, kind falls the, OK, well,
like woo science something like that. Now, obviously board-certified
physician psychiatrist arguably one finest medical schools world,
Harvard Medical School. Even though Stanford side, acknowledge--
acknowledge East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: Harvard-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Stanford East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: argument go back forth number times.
serious clinician serious scientist. serious thinker.
lot people there, notion using diet, immediately think, ah, well,
makes perfect sense. think category people think, well, yeah, didn't


Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,

00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits

just hard remember take meds consistently every day. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
say measuring ketones, want drill little bit seem
presence ketones somebody being, quote unquote, "in ketosis," turns
key variable. Certainly, book, one major takeaways--
although many important takeaways-- people get ketosis.
stay ketosis? instance, followed the-- don't longer.
tried, past, so-called cyclic ketogenic diet, every third fourth day, get
pasta, rice, et cetera. interesting experiment. stay
ketosis, sort blood levels ketones like see patients?
range think people aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: really
depends patient treating, quite honestly. don't think every
patient needs ketogenic diet. patients, simply getting rid junk food can
make huge difference mood disorder, instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
junk food, meaning, highly processed food, food last shelf long
time. CHRIS PALMER: Highly processed foods usually high sugar,
carbohydrate, carbs, fats. seem worst foods. combination-
- high sugar, high fat-- seems worst combination metabolic health. lo
behold, got emerging data suggests, strongly suggests, also bad
mental health. Depression anxiety common mental disorders.
best data disorders. actually lot data
even bipolar disorder schizophrenia insulin resistance, particular, insulin
signaling brain impaired people chronic mental disorders kind across
board-- way chronic anxiety, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia,
even Alzheimer's disease. know patients disorders
impaired glucose metabolism insulin signaling system brain,
different insulin signaling periphery, seems somehow possibly playing
role. step back that, patients, might just want decrease
glucose insulin levels. can getting rid sweets. patients,
like patients schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder, especially
chronic, using brain treatment, want ketogenic diet.


usually want reasonably high levels blood ketones. Usually, depression, want
see least greater probably 0.8 minimal. psychotic disorders bipolar
disorder, usually want see levels greater 1.5. shooting for,
possible. yeah, think go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
sorry, didn't mean imply people need ketosis order see
mental health benefits changing diet. make clear book--
go detail-- avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin
resistance, essentially trying reverse earlier described metabolic
syndrome, bunch different things, target. people,
getting rid highly processed foods focusing mainly nonprocessed minimally
processed foods will really help. others, going straight full-blown ketogenic diet
will benefit. like back little bit history

00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment

get something find incredibly interesting, epilepsy
longstanding use ketogenic diet fasting treat epilepsy. reason want
kind rewind point history that, think lot listeners people
familiar changing diet changing exercise can
positively impact sleep weight things, cascades feeling
better-- makes perfect sense. lot world still, idea changing
using nutrition dissection tool treatment tool understand treat mental
illness, still kind heretical idea, them, kind falls the, OK, well,
like woo science something like that. Now, obviously board-certified
physician psychiatrist arguably one finest medical schools world,
Harvard Medical School. Even though Stanford side, acknowledge--
acknowledge East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: Harvard-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Stanford East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: argument go back forth number times.
serious clinician serious scientist. serious thinker.
lot people there, notion using diet, immediately think, ah, well,
makes perfect sense. think category people think, well, yeah, didn't


Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,

expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,

possible. yeah, think go for. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
sorry, didn't mean imply people need ketosis order see
mental health benefits changing diet. make clear book--
go detail-- avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin
resistance, essentially trying reverse earlier described metabolic
syndrome, bunch different things, target. people,
getting rid highly processed foods focusing mainly nonprocessed minimally
processed foods will really help. others, going straight full-blown ketogenic diet
will benefit. like back little bit history

00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment

get something find incredibly interesting, epilepsy
longstanding use ketogenic diet fasting treat epilepsy. reason want
kind rewind point history that, think lot listeners people
familiar changing diet changing exercise can
positively impact sleep weight things, cascades feeling
better-- makes perfect sense. lot world still, idea changing
using nutrition dissection tool treatment tool understand treat mental
illness, still kind heretical idea, them, kind falls the, OK, well,
like woo science something like that. Now, obviously board-certified
physician psychiatrist arguably one finest medical schools world,
Harvard Medical School. Even though Stanford side, acknowledge--
acknowledge East Coast-- CHRIS PALMER: Harvard-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --friends. CHRIS PALMER: --of West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
not going talk-- CHRIS PALMER: Stanford East Coast.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: argument go back forth number times.
serious clinician serious scientist. serious thinker.
lot people there, notion using diet, immediately think, ah, well,
makes perfect sense. think category people think, well, yeah, didn't


Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

01:16:23 Mitophagy, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Aging & Diet

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman use code Huberman checkout.
Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight

far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, brave

Atkins die heart attack? hear lot. crazy. People immediately
discard Atkins diet reason, think throwing baby
bathwater. interesting thing nonetheless. think majority
people sit middle just want see science medicine come
treatments work. say, relieved hear said earlier,
was-- never said people come off medication just
become-- go ketogenic diet everything will cured. certainly not saying
that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: rather saying,
understand correctly, nutrition needs considered one major tools
landscape effective tools can effective, evidenced story
shared. many stories well truly miraculous
transformations. talk epilepsy ketogenic diet not just used
epilepsy one oldest, not oldest, examples use nutrition
treat condition nervous system can incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. reality literature, clinical history,
research godsend needed work doing.
Otherwise, discredited day one. Chris Palmer claiming
dietary change can influence schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder.
impossible. quack. thing immediately got credibility
didn't focus diet. deep dive epilepsy literature. ketogenic
diet, unbeknownst people, actually developed hundred years ago, 1921,
physician one one purpose-- treat epilepsy. wasn't developed
weight loss diet. wasn't developed diet human beings follow.
reason developed longstanding observation, since time
Hippocrates, fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting not healthy diet. Fasting
process no diet. now understand tremendous amount science.
people think going without food bad. equate starvation. fact,
go without food, causes tremendous shifts metabolism-- brain
body metabolism. puts body mode autophagy, conservation
resources, sorts things beneficial human health.
fasting used therapeutic intervention almost every culture, almost
every religion millennia. part, thought religious
folklore. just crazy talk. stupid people way back thought God
cured everything. fasted. just assumed getting


better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,

better. Well, 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting child seizures
found that, oh, Lo behold, religious folklore stuff something it. actually
worked. problem fasting can fast long starve
death. not effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: child
ingesting water, correct? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: just
food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
OK. CHRIS PALMER: no special diet. problem fasting epilepsy
soon people start eating normal diet again, seizures usually come right
back-- oftentimes, vengeance. can good short-term intervention.
fasting can take days can take days get ketosis.
can get relief chronic seizures. not good long-term treatment
because, again, people will starve death. soon start eating, seizures come
back. actually Dr. Russell Wilder Mayo Clinic developed
ketogenic diet one one purpose. wanted see, can mimic
fasting state, using special diet, see might stop seizures long-term? lo
behold, worked. Early results extraordinarily positive. 50% patients
use ketogenic diet became seizure-free. another 35% 50% greater
reduction seizure frequency, 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry interrupt. didn't mean there. just pediatric epilepsy
adult epilepsy well? CHRIS PALMER: back 1920s, didn't many
anti-epilepsy treatments. lot adults struggling well. using
anybody diet. 1950s, pharmaceuticals coming out.
many anticonvulsant treatments. no question, work
lot people. great. taking pill much easier diet.
diet pretty much fell favor. nobody using 1950s
'70s. lo behold, even day, people epilepsy, 30%
don't respond current treatments available. 30% will treatment
resistant epilepsy, means continue seizures no matter many
anticonvulsants taking, even brain surgery. just doesn't stop
seizures. 1970s, ketogenic diet resurrected Johns Hopkins
treatment-resistant cases. lo behold, works-- not them,
works in-- 1/3 become seizure-free. people who've tried everything
nothing's working. 1/3 become seizure-free. Another third get clinical benefit,
meaning 50% greater reduction seizure frequency. third,


doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,

doesn't seem work. not always clear noncompliance
diet's just not working. third, third, third-- seizure freedom,
reduction seizures, just doesn't work. reality, godsend
decades neuroscience research ketogenic diet
brain. know ketogenic diet influencing neurotransmitter levels-
- particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. changes calcium channel regulation
calcium levels, really important function cells. changes gene
expression. reduces brain inflammation. changes gut microbiome. Gut
microbiome huge topic right now. researchers argue
primary benefit ketogenic diet-- changing gut microbiome beneficial
ways. lot things. obviously improves insulin resistance.

00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health

lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, improves insulin signaling. key
research outlined, real magic, diet stimulates two
processes relate mitochondria. stimulates process called mitophagy,
getting rid old defective mitochondria, replacing new ones.
also stimulates process called mitochondrial biogenesis, means
people done ketogenic diet while-- months years-- many cells
bodies brains will mitochondria. mitochondria will
healthier. believe reason ketogenic diet

00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders

powerful treatment not epilepsy also people chronic mental
disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: mind listing off mental
disorders? know not meant inside ball, distinguish
psychiatric disorders neurological symptoms diseases. fields
psychiatry neurology hopefully someday will just emerge. instance, typically
somebody presenting something looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
talk neurologist. Whereas, somebody presenting symptoms, like
schizophrenia, bipolar, talk psychiatrist. wouldn't mind wearing
dual hat, just quickly list off neurologic psychiatric disorders


ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,

expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,

ketogenic-- just say-- nutrition changes shown improve
symptoms significantly. maybe can dive couple well
get deeply two interesting aspects mitochondrial function
repair turnover. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. terms nutritional psychiatry,
broad field. infancy, real answer. looking randomized
controlled trials documenting efficacy large numbers patients disorders,
don't them. underway now. don't yet.
case studies. lot mechanistic science papers
leading neuroscientists psychiatrists world-- neurologists world kind
outlining, everything know ketogenic diet doing.
problems brains people chronic mental neurological disorders.
know work. disorders range chronic depression to--
got trial underway PTSD. got one actually decent pilot trial
National Institutes Health ketogenic diet alcohol use disorder, things.
can go little more. got couple pilot trials ketogenic
diet Alzheimer's disease. randomized controlled trials. got case
studies ketogenic diet chronic depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia.
largest study got mental health sphere pilot study 31
patients admitted French hospital. 28 patients able diet
stay diet. 10%, off bat, noncompliant, couldn't diet. need
include that. 28 patients able do-- 28 patients
treatment-resistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, schizophrenia.
patients able ketogenic diet, 100% least
improvement symptoms. 46% remission illness. Remission illness,
not happen current treatments. 64%, think, discharged less medicine
went hospital on. wasn't people prescribing
medicine why. discharged less medication. got
least-- again, lot hard core scientists going say, show us randomized
controlled trial hundreds patients. got five randomized controlled trials
underway now, funded primarily philanthropy. can tell that-- talked
one index patient. point, now treated dozens patients.
heard hundreds patients who've treated clinicians,
researchers-- just heard patients around world-- shared
stories complete remission long, chronic mental disorders-- like bipolar disorder


schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman use code Huberman checkout.
Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,

yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.

even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts

staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.

people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,

schizophrenia-- off psychiatric meds. them-- not them,
able get off psychiatric meds remain remission. Again, think
didn't say before. really important mention. people might
unfamiliar mental health field connection epilepsy, reason
important connection use epilepsy treatments psychiatric
patients every day tens millions people. lot people don't know this,
list off names lot listeners may heard of. probably
know psychiatric drugs. fact, epilepsy drugs. Depakote,
Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax--
medications stop seizures. many developed initially
seizures. we, mental health field, quickly steal start using
tens millions people, even off label. means, don't
research studies documenting effective. go ahead use
anyway reality far many patients aren't getting better FDA-
approved treatments offer. psychiatrists just winging
cases. just throwing whatever can absolutely include
epilepsy treatments. many ways, using ketogenic diet treatment
serious mental disorders, nothing new all. established evidence-based
treatment epilepsy. use evidence-based treatments epilepsy across board
wide range mental disorders. many ways,
ketogenic diet. just happens diet. [CHUCKLES] ANDREW HUBERMAN: love
it. love it. say, love guest early days
podcast. colleague mine Stanford. bioengineer, psychiatrist,
phenomenal scientist psychiatrist, called Deisseroth, won Lasker prize,
forth. made really important point,
obvious wasn't said it, psychiatrist tools, just like
surgeon tools. tools language observing behavior.
dissection tools going someone's brain. neuroscientist,
familiar neurotransmitters neuromodulators. mentioned that--
tools altering brain chemistry, sorts drugs just
listed off, antidepressants, antipsychotics, fall major bins adjusting
dopamine adjusting serotonin combination dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine, on, on, on. seems me, incredible
field. field still much infancy wasn't hundred years


ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain
chemistry. think landscape, sort sociology of-- again,
seem bins, like third people saying, course, diet, exercise,
social connection, limiting stress, good stuff. stuff really
works. third people sort unclear. third people
think, well, not prescription drug, just no place medicine.
hopefully, changing. certainly, work

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman use code Huberman checkout.
Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

ago people measuring bumps head way diagnose phrenology,
still much learn. hear say, adjusting nutrition
putting people ketogenic state even just eliminating highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera, taking care metabolic syndrome, observing tremendous
relief clinical syndromes of-- symptoms, rather, psychiatric disorders, makes
perfect sense me. yet another dissection tool. tool altering brain

01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health

going important transition think will see. like talk
mitophagy mitochondrial biogenesis. think people learn mitochondria
energy factories cells indeed, are. neuroscientist,
know present everywhere neurons. Not just so-
called cell body, can find mitochondria furthest little bits neurons.
neurons can quite big, large. fact, meters long cases
species, including us. Depending tall somebody is, many meters-
- several meters rather. mitochondria lot stuff besides just produce
energy, think people hear "mitochondria," "energy," think, oh,
patients felt better. lost weight. energy.
better. talking remission auditory hallucinations, people
feeling suicidal changing diet feeling like life something can
deal with, maybe even function extremely well, et cetera. maybe
just talk mitochondria moment. talk two major effects.
things mitochondria important neurons
maybe cells brain? access point this, think
great people learn little mitochondrial biology. CHRIS PALMER: guess
first thing say field one cutting-edge fields medicine
right now. 20 years ago so, think majority research scientists thought


mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman use code Huberman checkout.
Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,

mitochondria nothing little batteries. take food oxygen turn
ATP. really important. Yeah, get that. just little batteries.
are. one reasons work important
combines cutting-edge research metabolic field aging field. can
start pair mental health neurological health field. mitochondria-- one
scientist gave analogy. said, think cell computer, lot
people think mitochondria power cord computer
providing power. are, fact, power cord computer. actually,
real function motherboard computer. mitochondria directing
allocating resources throughout cell. primary function.
happen powerhouses well. give clear examples, mitochondria
play direct role production, release, regulation really key
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.
pretty powerful neurotransmitters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, call those--
consider the-- know listed three. sort primary
colors neurotransmission. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: one
excess deficiency going profound negative effects nervous
system. going alter way people animals feel, think, move-- CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --remember, et cetera. CHRIS PALMER:
mitochondria providing building blocks, will,
molecules part Krebs, citric acid cycle. intermediate products
actually go making neurotransmitters. Much importantly, mitochondria
provide energy production neurotransmitters. fascinatingly,
mitochondria directly related release neurotransmitters. ATP alone not
enough. research studies actually found
mitochondria move along membrane synapse release batches vesicles
neurotransmitters, mitochondria removed synapse
researchers flood cell ATP, neurotransmitters usually not getting released.
Mitochondria things. don't entirely even understand
it. things just providing
power. Another really important example mitochondria actually primary
regulators epigenetics. look one factor-- one study actually found
responsible expression 60% genes cell.
mitochondria lot ways known years


sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

01:16:23 Mitophagy, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Aging & Diet

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman use code Huberman checkout.
Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond

will say yes, energy balance. epidemic

PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe

rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything

people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, brave

sometimes decades. mitochondria directly related levels reactive oxygen
species cell. managing calcium regulation cells. know
things play role epigenetic expression. know levels ATP ADP AMP
also play role. mitochondria things. turns out, mitochondria
actually much sophisticated things even terms gene
expression. Mitochondria least play role aspects human stress
response. humans stressed, either physically psychologically,
several things happen-- increased cortisol increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
inflammation, gene expression-- particular, hippocampus-- occur
stress response. one group researchers actually genetically modified
mitochondria four different ways, found stress response,
four buckets stress response impacted one way another, implying
mitochondria somehow playing role those. terms role cortisol,
know mitochondria actually enzyme required synthesis steroid
hormones. includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone,
names maybe everybody's heard of. means mitochondria short
supply dysfunctional, production hormones may become dysregulated.
Mitochondria play direct role inflammation. turn inflammatory system
on-- least play role turning inflammatory system off.
not going able quote exact study author. one paper cell
actually identified mitochondria key regulator turning certain inflammatory cells
off, inhibit mitochondrial function, cells don't turn off,
mitochondrial levels reactive oxygen species key signaling process turn
inflammatory cell process off. Another study found macrophages-- macrophages
important immune cell play role healing. cut yourself, body
will get-- send inflammation way send immune cells way try heal
skin. macrophages play important role healing. One group researchers
tried figure macrophages know switch different phases
wound healing macrophages different things different phases
wound healing. conclusion research mitochondria.
Mitochondria sending essential signals change state macrophages
induce different phases wound healing. just talked
neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. anybody familiar
mental health field, know key variables


researchers struggling decades, trying figure fit
together. know buckets can disrupted people mental
disorders. field struggled understand, fit together?
can make sense disruption? believe understand

01:16:23 Mitophagy, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Aging & Diet

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman use code Huberman checkout.
Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,

01:16:23 Mitophagy, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Aging & Diet

Again, insidetracker.com/huberman use code Huberman checkout.
Super interesting little subcellular goodies, mitochondria are. come field
people often divided lumpers splitters. somewhere
between. don't know, lumpers people like make things
really simple-- lists no three functions dividing brain areas no
three. Splitters people like subdivide ton detail. history
scientists splitters order able name things because--


CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW

may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental

CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: territory go
around splitting lumping. neither here.
hearing mitochondria, addition important sources energy production
output cells-- which, course, are-- probably roles. Maybe
someday, call mitochondria will actually two three different little
subcellular organelles. may little bits controlling gene
expression little bits controlling neurotransmitter production.
least now, name mitochondria. thank you, way, illustrating
things landscape science education,
oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production. There'll picture cartoon
mitochondria flexing muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty
mitochondria. think, oh, just sort like dumb jock portion
cell. not anything sophisticated. everything listed off
many sophisticated intricate things within cells. think things
cartooned discussed actually impact-- not just general public,
medical field science fields. Anyway, science sociology.
now everyone well aware mitochondria large number
important things regulated way, talk mitophagy. years ago,
Nobel Prize given autophagy-- sometimes called autophagy. Look,
people, can say either way. People will know hopefully means
important, gobbling one's cells dead injured.
idea autophagy, cells eaten within system-- nervous system
system-- come again. actually wasn't aware mitophagy
important lever. tell us mitophagy, presume the,
intentional not, gobbling mitochondria, presumably replace newer
healthier mitochondria. right? CHRIS PALMER: is. many ways, mitophagy
subset autophagy. got name specific mitochondria.
appear unique regulators mitophagy compared autophagy
broadly. Mitochondria actually playing role autophagy itself.
makes sense one of-- global picture autophagy stimulated
fasting states fasting-mimicking states. body senses don't
enough food, actually hunkers starts recycle dead old parts kind
carefully orchestrated way. takes lysosomes. get degraded.
degradation products get used either energy build new things.


Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, brave

Autophagy always occurring low level. can really hyperstimulate
process fasting, calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diets, things.
fasting calorie restriction kind hot topics medical field now.
shown induce longevity. think probably
process stimulating body kind become lean conservative
terms allocation resources. body doesn't just destroy healthiest
tissue along old dead stuff. processes identify old
defective parts first. go first. beautiful whole thing.
fasting important. mitophagy know plays really important
role because-- term called mitochondrial dysfunction,
researchers actually wanting get rid move away because, just
said, mitochondria many different things. different mitochondria even within
cell may well specializing different tasks. mitochondria one
cell another sometimes different things, like not mitochondria can
produce cortisol. specific specific cells genes getting turned
on. not like mitochondria producing cortisol. Just ones adrenal
gland, instance, producing cortisol. term "mitochondrial
dysfunction." long known, decades, mitochondrial dysfunction
associated everything ails us essentially. 1950s, theory
aging based reactive oxygen species. inflammation
bad comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: noise
antioxidants-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like '90s,
like, contains antioxidants. Not say antioxidants bad, certainly not
be-all-end-all health. CHRIS PALMER: not. exactly
research came from, researchers narrowing reactive oxygen
species highly, highly correlated diseases aging poor health
outcomes. turns out, also highly, highly correlated chronic mental
disorders interestingly. researchers used antioxidants see if, well, maybe
can stop, somehow tame reactive oxygen species, improve health outcomes.
Doesn't seem work. 1970s, understanding mitochondria role
production reactive oxygen species expanded. led mitochondrial
theory aging. 1970s, mitochondrial theory aging, based
primarily exclusively reactive oxygen species. Fast forward couple decades,
disproven now reactive oxygen species aren't bad.


actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given

expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable

actually serve signaling process. normal part human functioning
cellular function. not bad. still know high levels reactive oxygen
species bad you. Fast forward just, think, maybe last year, expanded
role different things mitochondria doing. David Sinclair published
paper one cell journals, think, saying that, oh, mitochondria actually
unifying link everything know aging. Mitochondria cause--
defective mitochondria defective mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dysfunction,
possibly unifying cause aging aging related disorders. mitophagy
trying address that. trying say, OK, bad. don't want defective
mitochondria can get rid old ones defective ones replace
new ones. think powerful signal tool right now is,
fact, related diet.

01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose

calorie restriction. oldest, truest, kind best-proven way prevent aging
wide variety animal species-- fasting intermittent fasting. again, can
things long. fasting-mimicking diets can also stimulate
process mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: talk mitochondrial
biogenesis, if-- certainly accept idea mitochondria extremely important
physical health mental health. That's, me, straightforward conclusion
point, based said, whatever elsewhere, et cetera. various
diets, including ketogenic diet, including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can
assist mitochondrial function mitophagy-- least one levers
diet can positively impact mental health physical health, can conclude
something special low blood glucose brain? sort common
pathway things-- fasting, ketogenesis-- people, maybe they--
maybe people great insulin management, just removing sweets, refined
sugars, brings blood glucose level substantially. don't need go
ketogenic diet order relieve low level depression something like that. Seems
like common theme glucose levels brain need reduced,
me, surprising neurons love glucose. really nice
studies. One can think recently published Neuron, just look
tuning neuron, well neuron brain represents visual image


environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain

means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given

environment terms-- here, can just generalize say, action potentials,
electrical signals neuron generally correlates better high fidelity
representation. sort everyone's time someone says, shout, someone
shouts, neuron one responding order. neurons just,
high glucose, faithful representatives world.
fast animal, become less faithful representatives
there. yet done intermittent fasting, kind modified version
it, mental clarity far better big bowl pasta-- probably
reasons related serotonin tryptophan. think typical listener
there, imagine, got little confusing. hear neurons love glucose.
live glucose. here, saying, deprive glucose.
just bring glucose levels down. switch fuel source brain
glucose ketones. now brain really works way supposed to.
raises little bit just story question, like case neurons love
glucose, yet much glucose around, become sick? course,
why-would-it-be story, say, wasn't consulted design phase.
going presume weren't consulted design-- CHRIS PALMER:
not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either. us say are,
probably patients need evaluation. think name
that. delusion-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right? OK.
threw first correct clinical assessment myself. get head around
this? got sold mitochondria-- not needed sold.
easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. idea diet can impact mental health physical
health-- yes, absolutely-- way mitochondria-- least part, great.
neurons love glucose. going on? think going on? CHRIS
PALMER: not convinced glucose real story. Glucose may, fact,
symptom. know parts brain-- couple studies just
came last couple weeks, think, documenting actually astrocytes
hypothalamus play key role glucose regulation throughout body. appears
metabolic role, mind, implies mitochondria
astrocytes probably playing key role know mitochondria play key
role sensing glucose levels. play key role release insulin
pancreas. mitochondria brain also playing role kind balancing
much glucose around. difficult question think cases,


high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,

high glucose levels actually symptom metabolic dysfunction somewhere
body brain. think about, well, mean? mind,
evidence currently pointing mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere body
brain. likely cause dysregulation glucose levels. know
consume massive amounts junk food, sugar, things, can
get dysregulation glucose levels. conundrum, though, not universal
response. ANDREW HUBERMAN: typical person? never really
liked junk food much. Maybe kid, can recall liking candy. sandwich
lunch person long time. changed salad maybe
small piece meat salad something like that, feel far better day,
far alert. eat carbohydrates. eat starches typically night. tend
hard training point day. imagine
glycogen repack. OK. me. mentioned not ketosis

01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria

far know. haven't-- unless brought strips, haven't done blood
glucose test today. typical person omnivore eating
rice, pasta, pasta salads, people eating not junk food massive amounts
sugar blood glucose kind moderate range? think-- here,
feel free speculate. think people might feel far better-- even
little bit better-- lower glucose state? ask think
lot people suffer full-blown depression. also
lot people suffer moodiness feeling not great, subclinical depression.
CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
just feeling days great, days, feel lousy reasons
don't understand. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: make
less dramatic case studies. yet assume description will net large
fraction general public. CHRIS PALMER: way kind break field--
probably getting nerdy right now. kind break field cause--
actual root cause-- effective treatments. really see
two separate things. Just ketogenic diet effective treatment,
not imply cause problem eating carbohydrates. think
really important distinction. many people disagree that.


no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back

people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

no doubt it. everybody's heard people say, sugar cause
everything ails you. carbs cause everything ails you. everybody
low carb diet ketogenic diet-- go to, must sugar
cause. don't see clearly black white that. Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction inducing metabolic changes brain
body. regardless person eating, inducing metabolic
changes can really beneficial brain health. let just give clear black
white example this. can speak broader topic brought
just general population. easy example ketogenic diet
effective intervention somebody not following bad diet infant
epilepsy. lots infants uncontrollable seizures. drinking
breast milk. best knowledge, primary, beneficial food
source infant consuming. Now, might say, well, maybe mother is--
whatever, don't buy that. mother's breast milk is, fact, optimal food source
infant. yet infant still seizing. put infant ketogenic diet, lot
infants seizures will stop. doesn't mean cause infant seizures
bad diet. means dietary intervention can change brain metabolism
improve symptoms person. going broader question adults,
modern-day, real answer is-- just conference London, Royal
College obesity medicine something like that. not name.
something along lines. conclusion conference invited greatest
minds obesity medicine, overarching conclusion conference don't
know causes obesity. really important sit that. don't know
causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: will argue that.
will say yes, energy balance. epidemic
obesity? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. Well, N-gazillion dollar question. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. will say, junk food. junk food 1970s.
growing up, grew Kool-Aid, Twinkies, King Dons,
HoHos, and-- [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: rewatching Mad Men series
now. love series, rewatching it. happen know someone
worked series. researched everything props, costumes,
everything, right diet. look diet, terrible. mostly--
yes, lot excessive amounts drinking cigarette smoking.


diets terrible. pre-packaged foods. frozen dinners. really came
prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got
tremendous amount evidence continues point direction. believe
mitochondria key obesity epidemic, something
environment. either food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep,
not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,
things known impair mitochondrial function. parts brain
regulate metabolism regulate eating behaviors not metabolically healthy,
means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none

use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,

prominence '70s '80s. even '50s and, reading,
even '30s '40s, people not eating grass-fed meat Brazil nuts
little bit broccoli rabe side. not typical intake. something there-
- maybe multiple things-- play increase obesity. CHRIS PALMER:
end day, believe-- will call speculative. actually think got

not getting adequate sunlight, whatever want speculate on, above,

means will not stop eating. means metabolism will not
rise challenge 10 donuts, people can eat 10 donuts go
staying thin healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: totally agree. Although, just
like say seems compared growing up-- again,
haven't run statistics-- fewer fewer individuals around now.
Just growing up, one two kids class quite
overweight. mildly overweight.
healthy weight. Nowadays, dramatically altered. landscape dramatically
altered direction. rare encounter one can-eat-anything
type people. know one, actually employee Stanford. media team
Stanford. guy, take lunch, like-- early 70s,
can eat. incredibly lean. exercises little bit. one mutants
just can eat, eat, eat, lean vital, he's-- wild.
expensive lunch. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
people seem rare. even kids now seem rare. CHRIS PALMER:
getting increasingly rare. leads think may

01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana

epigenetic factors womb environment, kids actually coming
predisposed obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let ask
note ask later. going interrupt now order


capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, brave

capture moment. understanding that-- well, everyone knows, inherit
DNA. get genes parents. mix. Although
incredible data Catherine Dulac's lab Harvard others showing
actually entire regions brain carry neurons purely mom's
dad's DNA, depending brain region. wild finding. accurate.
actually known terms heritability disease, et cetera. Maternal
DNA, DNA mom, genes mother-- not place blame mothers all.
understanding mitochondrial DNA come exclusively maternal
side. true? CHRIS PALMER: great question. asked
before. yeah, psychiatrists known blaming mothers. might say
trying redo whole thing blame mothers again. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
data data. not trying blame mothers here. Mothers play essential
role everything. true mitochondria linchpin
maternal DNA determines mitochondrial DNA, think important place
look. CHRIS PALMER: important question. answer unequivocally no.
not way works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, vindication anyone
asserting that. CHRIS PALMER: let explain it. mitochondria
36 genes unto themselves. 13 genes code mitochondrial
machinery making ATP. 36 play roles epigenetic regulation, play
roles whole body metabolism, things. inheriting
mom. mitochondria 36 genes part. majority
proteins make mitochondria, over, think, 1,300 genes make
mitochondria actually encoded nuclear DNA. inherit copy
mother father. majority people mitochondrial
defects rare mitochondrial diseases actually inherit either mom
dad can defect nuclear genes code proteins make
mitochondria. much bigger issue when-- talk mitochondrial
dysfunction primary driver mental illness, metabolic illness, not people
inherit defective mitochondrion mitochondria mom, just ruins
life forever. actually not way works. beautiful thing theory
connects risk factors already know play role mental health
also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria mitochondrial
function. Stress, high levels stress trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug
alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely-- terms smoke-- marijuana--


THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,

THC, particular-- impair mitochondrial function. ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly smoke? CHRIS PALMER: THC directly. studies done.
mitochondria actually CB1 receptors right them. various researchers,
couple studies Nature actually documented this, mitochondrial CB1
receptors primary-- kind primary points influence marijuana human
behaviors effects. remove CB1 receptors animal models,
changes don't happen. CB1 receptors-- got large studies
adolescents use lot marijuana. areas mitochondria
greatest number CB1 receptors areas brains actually atrophied
shrunk compared normal healthy controls. means brain tissue aging
prematurely. shrinking prematurely. CB1 receptors mitochondria also
seem play role memory impairment can induced THC.
also play role kind lack motivation, behavioral amotivational state
THC. Now, again, people want chillax, looking for.
don't want remember anything. don't want think. want spaced out.
want relax. great. important know actually
harming mitochondria brain cells. although always
opportunity repair mitochondria always opportunity stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis, can get back, keep chronically, probably
not helping overall mental metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
glad brought THC. episode cannabis. also one alcohol--
probably lost friends one. look data, clear.
not arguing people dislike effects compounds take them.
clear that, least me, based data regardless people
read red wine, not drinking alcohol going healthier drinking
alcohol, thresholds alcohol ingestion people start negatively
impact health one two per week. THC,
high concentrations THC present lot products now-- vaping
smoking THC even edibles-- can problematic.

01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet

mentioned adolescents predisposition, brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
case, mentioned alcohol commonly used substance,


heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental

otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,

heard give talk which-- think right-- alcohol can disrupt
way brain uses fuels kinds, may disrupt one's response alcohol,
make alcohol seem rewarding drink alcohol. drinking alcohol
makes alcohol rewarding brains alcohol drinkers, also might
alter glucose metabolism, basically alcohol not good brains.
correct? CHRIS PALMER: correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
happens take alcoholic somebody just drinks two four nights week
couple drinks, think pretty common there, put
ketogenic diet? experiment done? CHRIS PALMER: experiment
done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah. CHRIS PALMER: led none
woman named Nora Volkow, one leading neuroscientists addiction
researchers world. director National Institute Drug Abuse.
hot trail metabolic abnormalities brains people alcohol
use disorder, will just refer alcoholics everybody knows
as. hot trail many, many years. said, turns
reward pathways, particular, metabolically compromised alcoholics.
metabolic compromise essentially, nutshell, means aren't getting
enough fuel glucose. interesting thing people drink alcohol,
liver converts alcohol molecule called acetate. acetate travels brain
fuels brain cells, particular, reward pathway cells others.
chronic alcoholics chronic deprivation energy cells.
Nora Volkow researchers National Institutes Health study
set see can change brain metabolic problem alcoholics.
Will affect clinical symptoms alcoholism? will anything? clinically
useful. actually pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics
detox unit. Half patients got ketogenic diet. half got standard
American diet. everybody else, got detox protocol.
patients got ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines detox.
Despite that, fewer withdrawal symptoms alcohol. reported fewer
cravings alcohol. researchers brain scans, showed improved brain
metabolism key areas looking at. brains showed
reduced levels neuroinflammation, also something really
interested in. one study says us even though people think
alcoholism nothing diet, alcohol just drinking much. matter


willpower. somebody addictive. got addictive personality,
simple. come womb addictive personality.
people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, brave

people novelty seekers, impulsive. no patience.
no discipline. can't sustain kind rewarding experience. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: childhood trauma. a-- CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: --story there, well may be. But-- CHRIS PALMER:
may be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. CHRIS PALMER: research
study strongly suggests-- again, yes, maybe need larger controlled trials.
one leading neuroscientists world hot trail.
believes. believe. can correct brain metabolic defects
chronic alcohol use, might able help people sober give
fighting chance. give edge pull lever can use favor,
benefit. one caution research really want
highlight. now, going get hate mail keto community. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: OK. admire talking nutrition anytime
one talks nutrition, going get hate mail somebody. CHRIS PALMER:
caveat part research researchers
doing, actually wanted see will happen alcohol levels animal
consumes alcohol ketogenic diet. didn't humans yet.
fairly easy study do. hoping somebody will study soon.
instead put rats half standard diet half ketogenic diet.
exposed exact amount alcohol. rats
ketogenic diet five-fold increase blood alcohol levels. Five-fold increase.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, drank more? Or-- CHRIS PALMER: No.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER:
metabolized differently. rats got amount alcohol. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: people ketogenic, chuckling, not
alcoholics-- please, alcoholics, please something detrimental.
guess mean can drink less order get effect alcohol
people seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date
call that. need half drink instead three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
think keto community thank unless somehow
stake alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: reason put caution
anybody struggling alcoholism thinks hey, need edge up. need


lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important

Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate

important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental

lever pull really struggling give stuff up. just find going
back. telling brain metabolism messed up, might help it,
favor that. yes, researchers pursuing.
saying following caveat-- relapse ketogenic diet,
better not drink amount alcohol think can drink. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: deadly. CHRIS PALMER: deadly, and/or
really-- yeah, deadly someone else unfortunately, lot times
people drink, get behind wheel. think can handle two drinks
safely. think, well, can go dinner two glasses wine
drive home safely. know myself. go ketogenic diet, please don't drive
two drinks means blood alcohol level-- models anything
found rat study-- blood alcohol levels may five times higher
normally be. means really wasted. probably not
safe driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably true drinking
empty stomach, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Now,
important point. thank raising that. hear mitochondria,
blood glucose, mentioned astrocytes. you-- earlier
astrocytes non-neuron cell type brain, glial cell type postdoc
advisor known popularizing modern science glia, include astrocytes.
remiss didn't say considered cells hold everything
together brain kind passive observers. many things
actively. think now people appreciate astrocytes least important
neurons.

01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones

certainly, disease, often implicated warding off disease, et cetera.
Everything telling fact brain can regulate things
happening body, metabolism, et cetera, organ health, obesity, et cetera, me,
neuroscientist, not surprising. just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
hypothalamus here, telling me, regulating basal functions like
metabolism. regulating much crave things. course, hypothalamus
involved motivation craving. areas, too-- areas brain,
too, course. imagine someone mapped


receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, brave

receptors business brain. guess raises question of,
one goes ketogenic low blood glucose diet fast, anyone observed
changes brain? anyone neuroimaging humans brains
conditions ingesting one diet another, whether not psychiatric-- suffering
psychiatric disorder not? think gold is. CHRIS
PALMER: studies. neuroimaging study,
can measure lot different things. one thing PET scan, can measure
glucose metabolism. researcher, Stephen Cunnane research
particular Alzheimer's disease patients Alzheimer's disease models
humans. know that-- again, common finding patients
Alzheimer's disease glucose hypometabolism, people attributing
insulin signaling impairment. people calling type III diabetes.
end day, think clearest signal cells aren't getting enough
energy glucose fuel source. something think can confidently say
backed numerous research studies. debate research field
whether primary driver illness. happen believe is. ask
question, well, cells not getting enough fuel glucose?
focus mitochondria ones producing fuel glucose.
somehow implicate mitochondria process one way another.
Others will say, no, just side effect whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
Stephen Cunnane done studies even gives ketone supplements.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: liquid ketone esters? CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters ketone salts. actually found brain metabolism deficits can
corrected, least short-term, giving ketone supplement. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: context people also ingesting carbohydrate?
confess, tried ketogenic diet. probably wrong. years
ago. cyclic ketogenic diet. last year so, started using liquid
ketone esters. eat carbohydrates day, usually proportion
much high intensity exercise doing. liquid ketone esters, me-- least
subjectively-- feel greatly increase energy levels ability focus mentally.
improve sleep. observation tracking data just, again,
subjectively. example, talking people taking ketone esters
ketone salts backdrop ketogenic diet backdrop typical diet?
CHRIS PALMER: done both. done studies patients aren't


anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,

anything special diet. eating whatever normally eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving ketone salt ester, noticing immediate direct
changes metabolism metabolically compromised brain cells measured
PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: not household pets, way.
Sorry, have-- just-- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets.
Although, sure people dogs, cats,
whatever, pet kangaroos, whatever might own, ketogenic diet. OK.
CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. actually moved further. done pilot trial
nursing home actually, not put patients ketogenic diet. simply
reduced carbohydrate consumption breakfast lunch. still got
dinner everyone else. simply reducing carbohydrate consumption breakfast
lunch resulted cognitive improvement statistically significant way
subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, love result. sorry, just
highlight this. huge believer directing carbohydrates specific portions
day one needs less focused alert yet can replenish glycogen.
Limiting carbohydrates time day, me, game
changer terms maintaining alertness, et cetera. not aware age-
related cognitive decline. again, would-- people around may argue
otherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let say, Andrew Huberman. no way
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although didn't
know six-year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: cognitive impairment,
screwed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, plenty

02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet

flaws impairments-- well 3,000 documented people close me.
interesting, think, context everything talking
supplementing liquid ketones prescribing liquid ketones
people challenged mood disorders-- things sort--
beneficial, even not willing able adhere ketogenic diet? CHRIS
PALMER: million dollar question right now. don't good trial data
say yes no. speculation, hunch, tried clinically patients,
doesn't seem work. not thing. bigger reason feeling confident
saying ketone salts esters available decade now.


tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, brave

tens thousands children adolescents following strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet control epilepsy. kids love off
ketogenic diet. parents love off ketogenic diet.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER:
not one case report child controlling seizures using exogenous
ketones without also ketogenic diet. just find hard believe least
people haven't tried see. know patients bipolar
disorder even schizophrenia extraordinarily well ketogenic diet.
tried switch off ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones.
symptoms came back. found just wasn't effective. Now, again,
anecdotes. scientific speculation ketogenic diet
actually not necessarily ketones themselves. Ketones one multifaceted
story there. people ketogenic diet, also improving--
lowering glucose levels. improving insulin signaling. ramping
mitochondrial biogenesis, particular, liver mitochondria actually make
ketones. made. primarily made liver
mitochondria. somebody fasting state ketogenic diet,
liver mitochondria go roof called action. like,
hey, body's starvation mode. Get work. mitochondria-- cell senses
need mitochondria process fat turn ketones ketones
can get brain keep brain fueled, fatty acids can't fuel
brain. ketones can. Now, sense that-- gut microbiome changes
everything, changes hormones-- eating lot donuts
drinking bottle ketones, donuts going prevent body lowering
glucose levels. still going high glucose levels donuts.
still going probably impaired insulin signaling. probably still going
possibly inflammation inflammatory effects food. just
drinking ketones alone won't enough. think people metabolically healthy,
include that, think ketones can play really beneficial role, no doubt. think
exogenous ketones may, fact, proven valuable clinical use patients maybe
can't follow super strict ketogenic diet maybe low carb diet.
given research happening alcohol use disorder, imagine
situation-- million dollar tip whoever wants go get this,
actually turns true. imagine scenario use exogenous


ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, brave

ketones alcoholics. every time severe craving alcohol,
drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: sort tastes like alcohol.
ketone esters, take them, drink straight. Sometimes put seltzer.
not big drinker, mentioned. might alcoholic drink every
while. just don't ever crave it. just every maybe-- think 2020 last time
drink alcohol. obviously, not good representative example.
ketones taste good me.

02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose

obviously don't get drunk. seem flick alertness pretty
quickly. understanding brain's preferred fuel source. Meaning,
going first fuels used brain buffet fuels
available. glucose bloodstream, circulating liquid ketones,
ketones used first preferentially. true? CHRIS PALMER: think
complex question. research suggest brain areas
brain cells require glucose cannot use ketones. 100% brain cannot
fueled ketones far can tell. areas require glucose.
probably reason gluconeogenesis keep body going
keep brain going no matter what. ketones available, especially
ketones high, way think not ketones preferred fuel source
glucose goes wayside. way think range
cells varying degrees metabolic health. cells going
extraordinarily healthy appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria. cells
probably going continue use glucose fuel source. ketones happen
there, sure, use that, too. not? real money metabolically
compromised tissues, whether brain cells tissues that-- talking
brain. got metabolically compromised brain cells-- not
across board. Like Alzheimer's brain scans, specific regions
metabolically compromised others. see patterns atrophy
specific brain regions. regions dysfunctional metabolically
whatever reason. can get might be. sense
got metabolically compromised cell, cell sending distress signal. cell
calling resources body, like feed me. Give something. can't use


glucose effectively, going suck ketones start running
cylinders closer it. process critical means
cell barely getting 60% real ATP requirement, means
doesn't enough energy maintenance repair functions. soon give
cell hundred percent energy close it, even get 90%
preferred energy amount, can start repair itself. beauty human body
living organisms, priority list going do. cell
senses defective molecules, defective proteins cell need
replaced, gets enough fuel, will start repairing work.

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, brave

02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet

ANDREW HUBERMAN: makes sense. Thank clarification. like
talk Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline generally. know many people
just terrified losing memory obvious reasons. Memory sets
context, et cetera. many people relatives suffer Alzheimer's
forms dementia. heard ketogenic diet diets like can
effective helping offset symptoms Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline. fact, even friend won't institution, chair
Cardiology, contacted me, people, asking whether not aware
studies whether not knew anybody benefited ketogenic diet
Alzheimer's. thought, well, don't ask one colleagues neurology?
response really interesting. said many books
general public. lot online discussions this. lot
assertions this, animal studies. Again, words.
few, any, controlled clinical trials exploring role ketogenic diet
treatment reversal Alzheimer's age-related cognitive decline. hoping
statement incorrect soon will incorrect-- trials ongoing--
said, yeah, people popular telling us important role
positive role ketosis Alzheimer's, reason, just won't
clinical trial. frustrating community. educated,
accomplished person physician heart medicine opposed something
else related brain. story there. goodness' sake, aren't
clinical trials ketogenic diet Alzheimer's? don't expect


responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction

recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, brave

responsible fact. goodness, think obvious thing
NIH. study section not sorts experiments. isn't money just
avalanching area based anecdotal evidence people talking
about? CHRIS PALMER: got couple small pilot clinical trials. best one
randomized controlled trial. think included 26 subjects, something like that,
randomized 12 weeks low fat diet, 10-week washout, 12 weeks ketogenic diet.
participants got keto first low fat. participants got low fat
keto. trial actually found patients ketosis,
statistically significant improvement activities daily living quality life.
improvement cognitive function. didn't reach statistical significance,
improvement not. got trials. got several animal models showing
ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's
models. can reduce plaques tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment
animal models. got couple small pilot trials ketogenic diet
humans, showing improves biomarkers compared to, say, low fat diet
American Heart Association diet. got those. think one biggest
challenges just share openly-- is-- somebody pretty passionate
research. believe lot potential. Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted exactly kind study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic
diet versus the, think, American Academy Aging-- something like that-- diet,
controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: presumably starches there. CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: think key variable. CHRIS PALMER:
Probably lots of-- yeah, lots of-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: potatoes-- CHRIS
PALMER: Whole grains, lots whole grains. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
potatoes. CHRIS PALMER: spent, believe, three years. screened
1,300 people expressed interest. end day, think got 27
people enroll. 14 people completed study. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, found
subjects achieved ketosis cognitive improvement. people study section
going look study like say, even science there, can't get
people diet, spend money researchers trying get people
diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: mention, study section closed door
panels 40 people. many panels. Different divisions
National Institutes Health use different panels. grants evaluated


small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

small, size federal budget research, small percentage.
Usually, 10% studies funded. rest generally don't end
happening. informative. just described informative
now makes sense me. no conspiracy. not big pharma, don't think,
trying suppress trials ketogenic diets Alzheimer's imagine
first thing pharma want see study done. didn't to.
moment done, showed positive effect, probably want
isolate molecule wrap something people take, right? CHRIS
PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: don't think active suppression
pharma. think pharma probably cheering sidelines
capitalize it, ultimately, studies done scientists.
treatments generally doled pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
don't believe conspiracy there. interesting. kind amazing,
given discussion earlier, patient
schizophrenic symptoms managed stay diet. something
special Alzheimer's patients people age-related cognitive decline?
Presumably, dependent others cook shop them.
think almost perfect controlled environment getting study done. CHRIS
PALMER: think key issue. again, got patients-- get patients bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people diet stay it.
providing weekly session them. imagine study not
provide kind intensive support. pilot trial described you,
actually got, think, 90% compliance different dietary interventions.
going dependent research group. research group
understand not-- not like prescribing pill. Here, take pill. take
every day come back three weeks. even then, don't know sure
patient took pill every day. just assume took pill every day. studies
say probably didn't. think think dietary intervention, need
think intensive support education. support health
wellness coach. dietician. education family. might
even providing dietary meals. maybe six months, actually
provide ketogenic meals-- week, put freezer. Microwave
needed-- make diet easy doable possible.
can get people diet, can get first couple months,


people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing

bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,

people can learn diet. importantly-- didn't mention before.
number one reason successful getting patients stay diet
years, consequences go off it. reason
can get schizophrenic patients bipolar patients diet, whereas
people can't get everyday human weight loss weight
loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms break
diet. Oftentimes, rewarded. eat something really enjoy. get
little bit dopamine rush it. off races. like, going
to-- oh, already cheated. cheat again. get back someday. never
get around it. patients, go off diet, start hallucinating within 48--
24, 48 hours. quickly realize really stupid thing do. piece
cake not worth torment experiencing now. get back
diet. suspect Alzheimer's disease, might notice something similar.
people mild symptoms. maybe won't kind
reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind experience. think will.
recognize impaired cognitively. diet help
remember better, diet help function better-- again,
pilot trial showed, activities daily living. means people able go
bathroom own. able get dressed. Whereas,
needed help things before. actually really important things
patient caregiver. go off diet quickly revert
symptomatic state, might reinforcing enough figure way
diet own. think about, really effective intervention--
yes, need longer trials, larger trials, that, plenty
stories medical field pilot trials looked really spectacular promising.
larger trials just failed show benefits. believe, based science
metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, that, believe science
makes obvious treatment real potential. people will call biased.
fine. got bias. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based clinical observation
extensive clinical observation that-- think biases simply
want feel certain way believe something worth critiquing. bias based
observation-- here, mention know human memory
sparked one patient, famous HM, think living Harvard Medical,
one hospitals around. many hospitals Longwood Campus. one


patient, reason associate hippocampus memory knew
HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.
idea everything randomized clinical trial, me, crazy. course,
gold standard. essential. much information textbooks,
medical textbooks particular, gleaned single-patient case studies
three-patient neurostimulation brain something sort. me, still
perplexed insistence one form evidence. Clearly,
doing, important work

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:

HM's hippocampus intentionally damaged epilepsy treatment.

02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss

clinically, research side, public communication,
assisting this. question about-- statement/question
ketogenic diet. Based everything talked about, seems
ketogenic diet weight loss interesting aspect diet intermittent
fasting weight loss even though might just way caloric restriction
occurs fasting. ways, effects ketogenic diet weight
loss bit decoy people. mind goes. person lost
X amount weight. Maybe made feel better. Maybe actually made
underweight. think talked it. people, can actually bring
weight. glad got chance dive description ketogenic
diet epilepsy really medical intervention side effect
weight loss used treat obesity induce weight loss. really
far that. raises question me, is-- talking
ketogenic diet one thing. heard discuss before, just
physician will prescribe different dosage ranges given drug, can prescribe
different dosage ranges nutritional plan, diet. not one thing. not necessarily
zero carbohydrates 100 grams 50 grams. depends patient lot
factors. heard list off various things classic keto. Maybe just
briefly tell us typically is, think people think means eating
lot meat not carbohydrates. might not that. Fasting
other-- mentioned Atkins earlier. don't go detail.
know book, talk not just science clinical background
also actionable steps people consider. can refer


detail. somebody who, say, depressed-- rounds
depression. Maybe antidepressants, maybe not-- want try
something like this. Obviously, done concert physician observing
this. typical thing probe first? Just like drug,
might probe 20 milligrams drug. typical initial dietary intervention
probe? Terrible languaging, realize. criticizing that. think people
get idea. CHRIS PALMER: real answer don't one-size-fits-all
recommendation person. first thing going assess
patient is, symptoms having? current diet like?
willing do? try meet at. somebody-- want
point out. mentioned all-meat version diet, often referred
carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER:
no doubt exists. people swear it. swear tried
versions ketogenic diets went carnivore diet get
benefits. vegetarian vegan versions ketogenic diet.
mind, not diet wars animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.
inducing state ketosis, mimicking fasting state.
about. can not eating anything, fasting and/or intermittent
fasting. get results. no diet ketogenic diet. not
foods types foods eating. inducing state ketosis.
first variable going look recommend prescribe person's
current weight. somebody obese versus somebody thin, going use
different dietary strategies two situations. obese patient, tons
fat stores body already. Usually, goal tap those.
like lose weight going try ketogenic diet brain health
anyway. going use that. person, really, diet carbohydrate
restriction. usually sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose,
definitely. no added sugars, essentially. can added natural sweeteners like
stevia monk fruit. might use artificial sweeteners. Years this, probably
recommend steer away can think tend stimulate
cravings high carb foods. can kind get couple weeks without
sweet things, cravings will go down. it'll make diet easier
little sustainable. say can artificial sweeteners,


really want. going say less 20 grams carbs day people.
can protein want. can vegetables. can
fat want. not going push fat people. not going tell
them, eat lot fat, time want use fat body
fat source, least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: encouraging healthy fats
like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,

like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? encouraging people eat little less
butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: tend encourage, again, wide range fats.
going depend person. lot times, people come specific
ideas. going tend encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, usually
considered, even American Heart Association, healthy sources fat.
controversial thing things like coconut oil coconut cream, American
Heart Association might say not healthy fat, kind disagree don't
think unhealthy actually. look epidemiological studies
saturated fat causing heart disease causing adverse outcomes, best, maybe
increases risk 10% 15%-- best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: much coconut
oil can people ingest, anyway, either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- just sort
get tired coconut oil? Anyway, point taken. can eat meat like
meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: can eat eggs.
don't like meat eggs, eat sardines things sort. personally
can't-- can't even stomach the-- don't even like word "sardine." nothing
actual fish. just me. obviously, people have-- say
people different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: eat steak. not going eat sardine. CHRIS PALMER:
going go that. again, vegan sources protein that-- people can
eat tempeh things. obese person. carb restriction
primary initial phase. thin person going need eat lot fat
don't lot fat stores body. want ketosis, clinical ketosis,
going feed fat. person going say, make sure
get avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. heavy cream delicious.
delicious way get fats in. one patient just drinks straight, just
try get in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: get it. never appetite sweets.
absolutely love savory fatty food. high school, thin. able
this. used drink half-and-half. Sometimes wake middle night
drink just tastes so, good. CHRIS PALMER: taste good.


ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental
health issues, whether not family themselves.
otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,
based discussion, work. given us lot hints
underlying mechanisms suggest work. going given
us examples worked patients worked with. field
expanding fast. think area psychiatry medicine general. Meaning,
behavioral, nutritional interventions, expanding fast. thank
brave taking on, structured way,
communicating today. general public, book,
online presence. will certainly point people direction valuable
resources. Thanks much. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, know. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
appreciate it. CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, brave

worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental

otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing

ketogenic diet, going push away half-and-half toward
heavy whipping cream. can whip up. can freeze it. turns ice
cream. can add vanilla. can add cocoa powder. can add sorts things.
off races shakes, ice cream, mousse, sorts
things can have. patients, beauty diet
objective biomarkers. going measuring ketones. going adjust
diet based state ketosis and/or clinical benefits looking for.
average person, not currently psychiatric care, not taking
prescription medicines saying, burned out. exhausted. want
brain energy Andrew Huberman talking about. talks feeling good. want
that. probably actually going recommend protocol describe,
is, see can just carb restrict see produces clinical benefit.
one-- not even patient, just somebody read book. didn't tell
anything. came away saying-- ready start antidepressant
anxiety. chronic anxiety, trying meditation, trying sorts things.
Nothing-- things weren't enough. ready go prescription medicine.
read early copy book. took upon without consulting
restrict carbohydrates alone. not go ketogenic. vegetarian. restricted
carbs. Within three weeks, said, don't need prescription medicine. can't believe
much better feel. cut high carb foods diet.
think people, can simple. people serious mental disorders,
chronically depressed, lots prescription meds, disabled
symptoms, certainly, bipolar schizophrenia something,
people really want work medical professional
meds may need adjusted. need real shot diet. not like weight
loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. either successful aren't.
look internet read book do-- even colleague
mentioned, probably just reading-- knows whether credible information
not-- just winging it, seeing whether works not. people serious
mental disorders, want treat like epilepsy
serious brain disorder. impairing ability function world. impairing
health happiness. deserve competent medical treatment.
that. hundred-year evidence-based. got dieticians know like
back hand. can monitor level ketosis. can help look


vitamin nutrient deficiencies can consequence diet, make sure
not developing those. can help tweak diet needed. can give
ideas getting bored eggs every morning. can give ideas
else might have.

02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep

using treat serious disorder, think need serious help. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: couple questions, little detailed, think lot people will
mind. ever case prescribe somebody ketogenic
diet conjunction intermittent fasting? eat keto eat hours of,
whatever, 11:00 8:00 PM something like that. first question. CHRIS
PALMER: Absolutely. one patient type 2 diabetes chronic
depression. will try follow ketogenic diet. sometimes, blood sugars
still high. sometimes will ask either intermittent fasting even
three four day water fast. shocking. three four day water
fast, first day two, feels like crap. just say front, don't got
important meeting business trip anything. Don't be-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
just consuming water. CHRIS PALMER: just consuming water. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: No black coffee? CHRIS PALMER: usually tell can plain
black coffee tea. But-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: mercy all. CHRIS
PALMER: tiny ounce mercy. it, blood sugars plummet
good way, blood sugars normalizing. last time it, actually
got seven days one point. said, feel great. want keep going. can't
believe not hungry. not hungry all. don't miss food all.
seven days, kind cut cord. like, no, no. done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: needs eat. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] done. ANDREW
HUBERMAN: got eat. Well, find really interesting intermittent fasting,
course, controversial level, whether not just beneficial way
caloric restriction-- one way achieve caloric restriction-- whether not
additional benefits. interested neural side it. seem
fasted state can start take rewarding properties, people get
dopamine release not eating, everyone does, abstaining
food. Now, can pathologic sort example anorexia nervosa,


know deadly psychiatric illness. non-anoxerics, think
interesting note eventually not eating can rewarding properties
aren't just related weight loss. short-term, feeling-- words,
feeling really good way abstaining eating. CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
actually-- raises important risk haven't mentioned yet. least
psychiatric patients-- even patients just use keto diet weight
loss, seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: people
aren't sleeping much. also getting kind delusional, thinking going
run president? CHRIS PALMER: No. distinction hypomania
mania-- mania, might become psychotic delusional. Mania, definition,
problematic. causing problem way another. psychotic
symptoms, definitely called mania, full-blown mania. Hypomania, better worse,
something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got
things do. brain running cylinders. feel creative. lots
famous people ages bipolar, probably bipolar.
productive periods time, whether art creating scientific models
what-have-you, probably hypomanic episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
case? obsessed getting sufficient quality sleep. kind
repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't
recognize initially. went six months two four hours sleep every night.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER:
ketogenic diet, getting two four hours sleep every night, not
initially recognize problem. feeling great. feeling keto


high. actually waking 4:00 AM, going 10 20 mile runs days.
finally stopped ketogenic diet six months said, can't
maintain weight. losing much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, didn't
mean interrupt. just thinking social media personalities
associated nutrition might hypomanic. let clinical evaluation.
somebody case? don't know ever hypomanic.
mentioned earlier, unless done high intensity workout early day
need replenish carbohydrates, typically eat meat, fruit, vegetables
throughout day-- minimum amounts fruit some. night, switch
mainly carbohydrate. really helps sleep. replenishes glycogen stores. sleep
really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting
least six hours sleep night, need consider problem. figure way
get 6 hours sleep. people, enough, just education. don't
get bed 3:00 AM. might take hour fall back sleep. fall back
sleep. people, can get three nights decent sleep row,
hypomania goes away. way extinguish it. still go feeling
high it. feel great. brain feels good terms memory, concentration,
motivation, things. not hypomanic anymore. might use


supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher

unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic

bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
compounds? ever prescribe conjunction dietary shifts?
seems me, fall right catalog approaches
available. CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, not expert
medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: thoughts them?
seem weight loss drugs, not unlike fen-phen drugs '90s


banned people didn't handle well. CHRIS PALMER: are.
fen-phen. even that, 1950s, '60s, '70s, Dexedrine--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine. CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine-- ANDREW
HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: --was, yes, treatment
choice women across United States keep slim figures. created
addicts sorts problems. widely used probably millions
women work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: kill appetite. CHRIS
PALMER: kill appetite. overall thoughts this. zero doubt mind
obesity epidemic threat human health potentially human species.
keeps going rate going, threat species. figure
Earth happening, can it. medications, early
studies, highly effective year two. promising. worried, though,
not attacking root cause obesity. root cause obesity ends
kind poisoning metabolic machinery brain body--
argue probably relates mitochondrial health mitochondrial function--
every reason believe taking medication helps lose weight may not
addressing problem. therefore, may not addressing negative
health consequences call obesity. obesity, itself, know
excess fat can become inflammatory can cause problems, itself.
actually see obesity symptom. see obesity symptom metabolic
derangement body brain. people become obese.
really going get anywhere, need identify causing metabolic
derangement. Using symptomatic treatment like GLP-1 medication, best
knowledge, not addressing core problem. just ignoring it. Maybe
wrong. maybe will wonder drug saved human species,
everybody will thin healthy forever ever. not hopeful,
never-- many promising drugs come along. Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
things, many promising drugs. end day,
try muck human metabolism using single processed molecule, manmade,
can't think even one example great large numbers people.
Certainly, manufacturing insulin life-saving people type 1 diabetes.
example. giving massive doses insulin people type 2
diabetes, actually downward spiral. much rather see people type 2
diabetes control diabetes diet lifestyle. might ketogenic


diet, low carb diet, exercise good sleep, thing. it.
much rather see people try control type 2 diabetes
molecule, even though natural molecule insulin, know thats results really
poor health consequences, results higher rates cardiovascular disease, higher rates
mental disorders, higher rates premature mortality. think GLP-1 molecules
going different? No. don't reason think going be.
two cents, see. Time will tell. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will
tell. Meanwhile, want thank is, without question, pioneering work.
Again, not clinician. around space long enough know
indeed no wonder drugs. drugs certainly can help alleviate
symptoms individuals. lifestyle case work--
particular, discussion today-- diet and, ketogenic diet, particular, clear,
can incredible effects, miraculous effects, individuals. positive effects
others might not magnitude nonetheless extremely
important, behalf myself, listeners, certainly, just behalf
everybody there-- everyone need concerned mental

otherwise, impact everybody. Just really want thank viewing
work really pioneering. brave. can see now,

something every human probably craves. feeling extraordinarily good.
getting less sleep. don't need sleep. needs sleep? got

repeating theme podcast many social media posts. always
recommend behavioral tools first, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, occasionally,
people still struggle sleep, supplementation. One
things seen data people following low
carbohydrate diet, inositol, particular, can helpful getting sleep probably
bit an-- bit anti-anxiety effect. presumably,
things there, too. magnesiums will generally that. hot bath will
that, too, matter. talking people going, what,
day half without sleep? just two hours sleep night? CHRIS
PALMER: worst case saw actually mental health professional didn't

really well, wake next morning, repeat. course, goes lot
dogma that, oh, not supposed eat carbohydrates late day
[MUMBLES]. works me. it. somebody like mental
health professional, hypomanic, going off ketogenic diet entirely
best idea? adjusting eat carbohydrates
advantageous order make sure felt alert great day? Maybe
not hypomanic four eight-hour night sleep opposed
two four hours night, really little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, not-
- ANDREW HUBERMAN: can't healthy. CHRIS PALMER: not healthy.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even can feel great, imagine brain
suffering. CHRIS PALMER: is. body suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
friends family suffering. CHRIS PALMER: body repairing
sleep. yeah, it's-- somebody not patient, not mental health
patient. not using ketogenic diet mental health treatment. simply
whatever. actually start everything just outlined. start
behavioral measures first. first intervention education. need least six
hours sleep night. Period, end story. non-negotiable. not getting

supplements, melatonin, others mentioned, magnesium big one.
some, will recommend exactly doing-- eat carbohydrates
evening going bed. Either dinner wait
hours going go bed right going go
bed, just try calm body get going. using clinical
intervention, especially patients serious mental illness, actually want
state ketosis long-term. not going carbohydrate intervention. going
try ones. still can't sleep even supplements,
counter supplements, probably going go prescription, sleeping
medicines, temporary stopgap try get three seven days decent
sleep. usually breaks hypomanic cycle. stay ketogenic
diet ends resulting improvements described.
illness can sometimes go full remission. ANDREW HUBERMAN: low
dose trazodone first line prescription? CHRIS PALMER: not use trazodone.
actually specifically avoid trazodone antidepressant.
already hypomanic. certainly don't want push further. long
somebody without history addiction, going use benzodiazepine either
commonly called Z medicines sleep-- zolpidem Ambien something like that.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: tap opioid pathway? GABA opioid? CHRIS
PALMER: GABA. usually start something like Ativan Klonopin something like
that-- probably Ativan shorter-acting. again, looking use
short-term. let know front. looking three seven days decent
sleep. going try get off medicine.

02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility

usually, people off races can sustain well. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
question hormones. Many Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask--
time talking something like exercise drug treatment behavioral
training, people will say, menstrual cycle? impacted this?
menstrual cycle impact efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates caloric
restriction implicated different interactions-- known interact
endocrine system. patient depressed
psychotic symptoms-- go depression probably bit


familiar people-- low carbohydrate full ketogenic
diet, menstrual cycles cease. deal adjustments?
guess expand conversation say, male fertility also?
caloric diets seem to-- understanding submaintenance caloric
diets, weight loss diets, will improve testosterone-estrogen ratios males
obese. someone not obese, go sub-caloric diet, can start
impair testosterone levels and-- probably not render infertile certainly adjust
whole axis. interactions ketosis, diets, et cetera,
endocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: real answer is, don't think anybody knows.
not one-size-fits-all answer seen examples. aware
science back polar opposite conclusions. first general observation
make-- know many couples, husbands wives, boyfriends girlfriends,
heterosexual couples, tried ketogenic diet lose weight together--
ANDREW HUBERMAN: end baby? No, just kidding. [LAUGHS]
CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, men much easier time
women. not across board. know many examples women
say couldn't tolerate diet. not make feel better. actually made feel
worse. think cases, probably relate hormones. aware
animal models, mice-- particular, ketogenic diet mouse models. One researcher
shared me, thing striking female mice never got pregnant
ketogenic diet. Whereas, mice standard diet just babies right
left. just shocking, difference. surface, makes sense.
ketogenic diet mimicking fasting state. Women trying reproduce
not fasting. body fasting state, probably not want expend
resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, things, creating baby
life threatened by, quote unquote, "fasting" starvation.
even though ketogenic diet sustainable, nonstarvation diet, really
using diet trick body thinking fasting starvation state.
just kind evolutionary stance, makes sense women's bodies may
actually significant changes hormonal status prevent pregnancy
woman not baby starving death. know examples
women opposite, though, benefited dramatically
tremendously ketogenic diet, put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder full
remission. actually know one case, least one case. woman, infertile,


husband trying three years, no pregnancy. went keto. Within
four months, pregnant. make sense that? don't know.
unfortunately, don't think really good control data ketogenic
diet male hormonal systems, ketogenic diet female hormonal
systems. clearly, think changes happening. don't way predict it,
least. somebody else great insights, welcome them. haven't seen
published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: terrific answer things
place bidirectional, depending one circumstance other, think
screams controlled studies, descriptions case studies, anecdotal
data, too. think excellent answer. also calls mind important public
service announcement bidirectional effects described,
please don't use fasting ketogenic diet reliable form

02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications

contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please
don't. final question, relates something much starting get
buzz now-- maybe people hang Twitter space
nutrition space. new class drugs think initially developed
treat diabetes now evaluated efficacy treat obesity.
semaglutide drugs involved in-- tap glucagon related
GLP-1 pathways. story talked little bit podcast
before. many people, imagine, probably haven't heard conversation.
simply like know think drugs. obviously adjust way
glucose insulin managing energy, body brain, can
produce weight loss. me, look data, impressive. good
logical shift diet exercise achieve similar weight loss. lot people just
won't that. question is, thoughts semaglutide
GLP-- think might said GLT before, excuse me-- GLP-1 related
