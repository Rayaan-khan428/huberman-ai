Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love
attachment, tend put much value forget many

maybe just small set people. delusion? Well, work Helen
Fisher others really pointed fact desire, love attachment
three separate phases call romantic relationships. typically, not always,
typically desire tends come first falls early phase. process
romantic/sexual interactions, doesn't necessarily sex itself, certainly
something involves intimacy kind, right? generally touch kind,
eventually transitions call love, eventually transitions
call attachment. just mention touch touch fundamental aspect
whole process. article, research article, say, title is,
"Relationship-specific Encoding Social Touch Somatosensory Insular Cortices."
Cortices cortex. Cortex's plural, cortices. again, friend insula.

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall
category positive delusions. return exactly look like.
also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team
University Washington Seattle. Gottman's have, run laboratory
department psychology long time. also done lot public facing work
around relationships. talked various aspects relationships
interactions people predict either staying together breaking up. much
established method can look video interactions
couples high degree certainty predict whether not
couples will stay together break time. identified call
four horsemen relationships. things essentially, almost always predict
couple will break up. think current number Gottman can
predict divorce 94% accuracy, think pretty remarkable.
even though purely psychological studies, not aware analysis
underlying physiology, things can observe couples
can lead predict whether not couple will stay together break


94% accuracy. things? four behaviors, call Four

powerful predictor breaking up. Criticism, course, not mean no
place criticism stable relationships. course, is.
frequent intensely criticism voiced. Defensiveness, course,
defensiveness. know lack ability hear another adopt stance.
lack empathy, think one way interpret defensiveness. Stonewalling,
actually another form lack empathy. turning off neural circuit
critical desire, love attachment. stonewalling essentially means
emotional response request another completely cut off. it's, don't think
brain imaging this, think, can reasonably imagine involves
untethering insular response dealing with,

perhaps state someone else entirely. talk infidelity moment.
contempt. contempt actually referred sulfuric acid relationship.

want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting

well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory

love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not
neurochemical hormone systems tuned toward particular types behaviors.
mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men
testosterone estrogen, testosterone
women, less estrogen women. Typically women estrogen
testosterone, again, averages. less testosterone men,
estrogen men, forth. hormone systems active
sets individuals. course, humans, far know, manufacture
dopamine serotonin. Dopamine, mentioned earlier, number effects

hormones make ovaries testes, secrete testosterone estrogen.
lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might
relationship financial stability isn't quite there, basic
stability isn't there. imagine, instance, situation relationship
two people called high serotonin preference

point, wasn't enough dynamic tension sometimes
required order keep cycle desire, love, attachment going. Something
will talk moment. point not one necessarily pair

can actually gain control techniques sort
talked earlier previous podcasts, also generally, able adjust

cognitive empathy. talking today

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

exploration fact saying, book, song, example
pretty much relationship dynamic, want now talk article came

simply stance. not basing hardcore neurobiological

related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains
academic science. whole basis article 36 questions lead

can find easily online just putting search engine, 36 questions lead

36 things, embarrassing moment life?

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological
studies psychological studies really point that. instance, never say
serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way
yet. cautious assigning without evidence. However,
interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective
measures humans, meaning asking questions good ways tease

00:22:06 Strange Situation Task, Childhood Attachment Styles

unless say otherwise, data referring today entirely human
beings. talk attachment attachment styles. will offer
opportunity answer important questions yourself, my,
meaning, attachment style relationship? One robust findings
field psychology notion attachment styles. something
discovered beautiful set studies done Mary Ainsworth
1980s, developed laboratory condition called strange situation task.
Now, strange situation task studied different
cultures, different locations throughout world. preparing episode,

adjustments people can change attachment style, indeed people
different attachment styles can change attachment styles others. just
make clear results study were, want review four
different attachment styles are, typically people fall one group another not

third category so-called anxious-ambivalent/resistant-insecure category.
Okay, didn't name categories. blame others one instance.
everything else blame me, instance, blame psychologists

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant

beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control

complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes

people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different

sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.

EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point

anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates

case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair

statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate

00:22:06 Strange Situation Task, Childhood Attachment Styles

unless say otherwise, data referring today entirely human
beings. talk attachment attachment styles. will offer
opportunity answer important questions yourself, my,
meaning, attachment style relationship? One robust findings
field psychology notion attachment styles. something
discovered beautiful set studies done Mary Ainsworth
1980s, developed laboratory condition called strange situation task.
Now, strange situation task studied different
cultures, different locations throughout world. preparing episode,
actually spoke three different psychologists. spoke psychoanalyst, spoke
cognitive behavioral psychologist, actually spoke psychiatrist, excuse me, not
psychologist, psychiatrist medical degree asked, strange
situation task various attachment styles emerge task,
still considered valid? indeed three said ever literature
psychology absolutely tamped firm basis data real
world principles real world examples, notion attachment styles.
strange situation task? strange situation task involves parent, typically
mother studies done, parent caregiver bringing child,
actual child laboratory. room stranger mother
enters room child toys room. typically
mother stranger will talk. Obviously stranger part experiment, not
just random person off street. child allowed move room.
can observe mother interacting person not, can play

reacts mother returning end experiment. oftentimes will
two three different phases mother will bring child leave,
come back leave. also studies behavior child


stranger also examined. lot variations this, basic
findings toddlers, children fall four different categories attachment style.
attachment styles can predict many features adolescent, teen, young
adult, even adult attachment styles, not strange situations sort just

attachment styles rigid fixed entire lifespan. also terrific data
indicate specific processes, psychological biological
adjustments people can change attachment style, indeed people
different attachment styles can change attachment styles others. just
make clear results study were, want review four
different attachment styles are, typically people fall one group another not
several. four patterns attachment revealed studies, again,
revealed examining behavior child response mother leaving

changes heart rate tend less dramatic anxious-avoidant insecure
attachment style secure attachment style. Okay, second one.
third category so-called anxious-ambivalent/resistant-insecure category.
Okay, didn't name categories. blame others one instance.
everything else blame me, instance, blame psychologists
named category. anxious-ambivalent/resistant-insecure category also
called C babies, letter C just categorization. anxious-ambivalent,
resistant-insecure toddlers, really, show distress even separation
mother caregiver. tend clingy difficult comfort
caregiver returns, okay? distressed even mother leaves
room tend clingy really hard calm mother
returns. tend show either seems resentment response
parent's absence. don't really know feeling. helpless passivity.
actually subcategorizations psychologists come with, C one
subtypes C two subtypes. don't get bogged that. just know
isn't one absolute measure says, oh, well, person anxious-
ambivalent, resistant-insecure. somewhat passive, be,


seem somewhat angry caregiver. basic idea

large, way done. certainly way done historically
not tens thousands hundreds thousands years. process also
happens mammalian species mate. Okay, overlooking entire
literature animal studies classic studies done two individuals,
just briefly mention case want look literature. guy
Rockefeller University named Donald Pfaff, P-F-A-F-F, done beautiful studies
identifying neural circuitry, called lordosis response. Unlike humans,
mating behavior animals rather stereotyped terms positions
occupy. lordosis response U-shaping bending hindquarters
typically rodents, animals well. male mounting almost
always behind except species primates. lordosis response


going occur particular phases estrous cycle. estrous cycle
analog menstrual cycle, not 28 days, four days
duration animals, depending animal. lordosis response strongly
regulated odors, contact estrogen testosterone controlled.
male portion mating sequence animals, mounting thrusting
ejaculation called mounting, thrusting, intromission ejaculation.
four scientific categories described, presence rodents
also dogs primarily studied Frank Beach, University
California, Berkeley long time. entire literature around neural circuitry
sexual mating behavior animals largely stemmed work Donald Pfaff
Frank Beach scientific offspring, not actual offspring. can look
literature, like. human neuroimaging studies process
described minutes ago, believe not, people brain scanners, not
necessarily mating people, going arc arousal, sympathetic
activation orgasm ejaculation post-ejaculatory orgasmic phase
men women. brain areas associated
mapped now. spinal cord areas control things like erection, vaginal
lubrication, ejaculation orgasm, also mapped out.
explored perspective basic science, just get understanding
species sexual interactions reproduces, also
perspective of, instance, trying repair sexual function spinal cord injury,
prominent concern lot people, depending injury,
number people spinal cord injuries. vital biological
clinical data. neural circuits everything just described reside
autonomic nervous system coordinated neural circuits
associated empathy. neural circuits empathy, again, many,
mainly two structures know about, prefrontal cortex,
perceive things outside us make decisions basis perceptions,
organize decisions, area brain called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.
insula really interesting brain area allows us interocept, pay attention
going inside body split attention, exterocept.
mating dance, whether not dinner date portion mating dance,
actual physical dance part main dance, actual mating sexual behavior,
kissing otherwise, coordinated activity two bodies, typically two.


realize sometimes more, sometimes one, typically two bodies least
framework using here. coordinated dance one

autonomic nervous system individual. insula essentially splitting

thinking bodily sensations other. can communicated,
obviously, words, can communicated sounds, can

depending whether not person's seesaw tilted higher lower
other. Okay, autonomic nervous system, thing
calling empathy, really autonomic matching. again,
insula prefrontal cortex neural circuits crucial autonomic
matching,

01:10:02 Positive Delusion, Touch

allow us say, there, want match not?
Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love
attachment, tend put much value forget many
processes going brain body actually evoked many
people too. think somewhat overlooks enormous power attachment
ways somebody's smell, somebody's voice, somebody's everything,


somebody's particular thing things can really become vital autonomic
nervous system feel soothed feel elated, et cetera. think
quote accurate, one sense, think overlook neural circuits
attachment just deeply wired can become us. will balance
quote enormous number quotes won't mention, can
find really point incredible person one tends
attached really one several people ever exist
evoke feelings us. course can read Neruda poetry,
can find things place, music, poetry, writing. every
cynical quote neural circuits generic activated
anybody, think find ample number opposing quotes neural
circuits can activated special someone, particular person,
maybe just small set people. delusion? Well, work Helen
Fisher others really pointed fact desire, love attachment
three separate phases call romantic relationships. typically, not always,
typically desire tends come first falls early phase. process
romantic/sexual interactions, doesn't necessarily sex itself, certainly
something involves intimacy kind, right? generally touch kind,
eventually transitions call love, eventually transitions
call attachment. just mention touch touch fundamental aspect
whole process. article, research article, say, title is,
"Relationship-specific Encoding Social Touch Somatosensory Insular Cortices."
Cortices cortex. Cortex's plural, cortices. again, friend insula.
study explored brain areas body areas activated
specific forms attachment social touch. found not surprisingly
areas brain associated touch, somatosensory areas,
interestingly, insular cortex strongly activated touch. touch
amount touching, proximity, skin contact, not surprisingly activates brain
areas associated somatosensory, touch, also insular cortex, again,
brain area links internal feelings going inside us
surface skin events external. found activation number
brain areas, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, on. not
essential just understanding insular place start take
experience internal landscape, attach perceptions external


landscape, assign value assign sort interpretation.
positive delusion predictive long-term attachment. mean positive
delusion? Positive delusion contradiction George Bernard Shaw quote.
belief person can make feel way. person holds
capacity make feel way physically emotionally both. so, move
desire love attachment, brain circuitry literally getting tuned
individual happen attached to, again, thinking
monogamous relationships, guess non-monogamous relationship individuals
way autonomic nervous system can regulated. actually
get access control panel.

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall
category positive delusions. return exactly look like.
also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team
University Washington Seattle. Gottman's have, run laboratory
department psychology long time. also done lot public facing work
around relationships. talked various aspects relationships
interactions people predict either staying together breaking up. much
established method can look video interactions
couples high degree certainty predict whether not
couples will stay together break time. identified call
four horsemen relationships. things essentially, almost always predict
couple will break up. think current number Gottman can
predict divorce 94% accuracy, think pretty remarkable.
even though purely psychological studies, not aware analysis
underlying physiology, things can observe couples
can lead predict whether not couple will stay together break


94% accuracy. things? four behaviors, call Four
Horsemen Apocalypse [laughs] relationships one, criticism, two,
defensiveness, three, stonewalling, four, contempt, contempt
powerful predictor breaking up. Criticism, course, not mean no
place criticism stable relationships. course, is.
frequent intensely criticism voiced. Defensiveness, course,
defensiveness. know lack ability hear another adopt stance.
lack empathy, think one way interpret defensiveness. Stonewalling,
actually another form lack empathy. turning off neural circuit
critical desire, love attachment. stonewalling essentially means
emotional response request another completely cut off. it's, don't think
brain imaging this, think, can reasonably imagine involves
untethering insular response dealing with,
focusing insular response, [giggles] no pun intended, internal state
perhaps state someone else entirely. talk infidelity moment.
contempt. contempt actually referred sulfuric acid relationship.
didn't say that, Gottman colleagues have. powerful predictor
divorce breakups future. contempt, course, definition feeling
person thing beneath consideration, worthlessness deserving scorn.
apparently can identify videos couples discussions
interacting elaborate eye rolls, expressions anger one individual
partner actually expressing enthusiasm excitement something. the,
oh yeah, say that, deep seated resentment toward other, much
apparent one actively dislikes partner. contempt, disregard
something taken account way think it. runs
counter neural circuits, three neural circuits talked
before. certainly, antithesis empathy. anything positive delusion.
really looking individual, either accurately inaccurately somebody
despise. absolute inversion autonomic seesaw matching
talking before. dissociating seesaw seesaw.
excited something, unexcited it. fact, inversion
seesaw excited, down. down, up, okay?
basically inversion neural circuits Helen Fisher others
identified critical desire, love, attachment. therefore not surprising


strongly predictive breakups, case married couples, divorce.
interested work Gottman's similar work,
written several popular books. fairly easy find. can link one
caption. also developed quite interesting online resources
so-called Love Lab. guess fortunate didn't call Hate Lab
Breakup Lab, 'cause focused lot predicts breakups. also
written extensively researched extensively peer-reviewed studies makes
people find appropriate partners them, maintain partnerships time.
can go, can search Love Lab, University Washington, Gottman,

01:21:22 Selecting Mates, Recognition Autonomic Tone

number various books. think find useful resources there.
want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory
setting. idea sex drive way forage potential love partners
love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not
neurochemical hormone systems tuned toward particular types behaviors.
mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men
testosterone estrogen, testosterone
women, less estrogen women. Typically women estrogen
testosterone, again, averages. less testosterone men,
estrogen men, forth. hormone systems active
sets individuals. course, humans, far know, manufacture
dopamine serotonin. Dopamine, mentioned earlier, number effects
brain body. one primary effects places us states
motivation pursuit various things. somewhat close relationship
dopamine system testosterone system hypothalamus, brain area
roof mouth. pituitary gland, responsible making
hormones make ovaries testes, secrete testosterone estrogen.
lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might
relationship financial stability isn't quite there, basic
stability isn't there. imagine, instance, situation relationship
two people called high serotonin preference
relationship actually dull, found bored
point, wasn't enough dynamic tension sometimes
required order keep cycle desire, love, attachment going. Something
will talk moment. point not one necessarily pair
according arrangements described. point average,
tends happen. recognition categorizations exist
similar recognition type A, B, C, D infant toddler type attachments
exist, can gain better self-awareness tend show
romantic attachments, thereby navigate healthier mate seeking, healthier


breakups, case dictates it, cases healthy long-term relationships
understanding person can either similar complimentary us. One
neither better other. simply case romantic attachments,
initial inception romantic attachment, desire, love, attachment,
autonomic coordination. course coordination sorts things like
food, sex, sleep, finances, people going live, many
features, core seeking either autonomic likeness
autonomic differences. think recognition can extremely valuable thinking
tools enter maintain relationships. one thinks autonomic
nervous system, not simply something driven external people events,
can actually gain control techniques sort
talked earlier previous podcasts, also generally, able adjust
autonomic nervous system order least appreciate get empathy
someone else experiencing, gain actual cognitive empathy.
episode isn't empathy per se, theme keeps coming again.
think worth mentioning talk psychologists, whether not
psychoanalyst another source training, find don't
talk empathy general term, will talk emotional empathy, talk
cognitive empathy. talking today

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

01:47:43 Autonomic Coordination Relationships

play driving calling desire, love attachment. keeping
exploration fact saying, book, song, example
pretty much relationship dynamic, want now talk article came
little 10 years ago talked universality love ability
fall love. much line George Bernard Shaw quote
mentioned earlier "Love really overestimating differences
individuals." again, say not something personally believe,
although maybe just diluting myself. like think people fall love
really special us, not easily replaced anybody else.


simply stance. not basing hardcore neurobiological
mechanism. nonetheless, article published New York Times 2015
related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains
academic science. whole basis article 36 questions lead
love. involved listing indeed 36 questions, divided set one, set two,
set three progressed somewhat ordinary questions life experience
self-report more, call deep questions people's values things
emotionally close them. just give example these.
can find easily online just putting search engine, 36 questions lead
love. questions set number one, instance,
constitute perfect day you? life feel grateful? Kind
standard questionnaire stuff. set two, treasured memory?
terrible memory? these, can tell, drilling little bit deeper
one's personal experience emotional system. set three, questions 25
36 things, embarrassing moment life?
last cry front another person yourself? something serious
joked about? going deeper one's emotional system. even questions
like, people family, whose death find disturbing
why? pretty, pretty heavy stuff end. Now, reason article got
much traction, reason bringing today statement
made around article two people went date simply sat
asked questions, answered questions
paying attention carefully level emotionally responding not
responding, certainly paying attention answers person,
end exchange, one person asks 36 questions person
answers 36, person asks 36 person answers
36, fall love, right? seems like ridiculous thing. yet
case people go exercise report feeling know
person quite well feeling certain levels attachment even love desire
person were, not predicted, excuse me, not
predicted not gone process. going exchange
questions answers progressively emotional deep level? Well,
predict going inside exchange, people creating delusional


story nature exchange reflection deeper attachment.
even though people just exchanging words, not physically touching,
not, least not point running kinds questionnaire
studies. may touch afterwards know, probably cases,
not exchanging life experience immediate way. not actually going
off world things together yet. simply exchanging narrative.
know based recent studies covered podcast,
mention again, study published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal showing individuals listen narrative, heart
rates tend synchronize least follow similar pattern, even not
room listening given narrative. Whereas case, people facing
one another listening narratives other. Certainly
autonomic responses. stands reason autonomic nervous systems
synchronizing much way Cell Report study found people will
synchronize autonomic nervous systems shared, heard story another.
words, whether not hear story, watch movie, listen song,
exchange individual stories, autonomic nervous systems potential
map onto one another. not surprised people find fall
love, quotes, answering questions one another, essentially
way questions laid establish narrative. establish
personal narrative person listening closely. don't
physiological brain imaging studies support say,
reasonable interpretation causing autonomic synchronization.
want try date even actually hypothesized
useful existing couples, even already know answers
questions. doesn't surprise either. think autonomic coordination

established sharing one's narrative personal experience. don't
want seem overly reductionist. never propose sensation, perception,
action experience life boils us just bags chemicals action
chemicals, aspect nervous system. yet looking across
psychological literature development attachment, psychological literature
adult romantic attachment, makes breaks attachments,


clear me. think courses literature multiple levels, autonomic
coordination absolutely key establishment desire, love attachment.
fact, talked earlier actual conception born autonomic
coordination one sort another. again, doesn't necessarily mean autonomic
nervous systems always synchronized case two categorizations
Fisher proposed director/testosterone type nurturing follower/estrogen

categories led stable attachments seeking

simply required mating behavior also reflected autonomic nervous
system. case, failure coordinate

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological
studies psychological studies really point that. instance, never say
serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way
yet. cautious assigning without evidence. However,
interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective
measures humans, meaning asking questions good ways tease
lies truths sorts studies whether not people tend find
partner others less attractive depending people feel


themselves. think interesting aspect desire, love, attachment
following reason. hear lot order form really strong
relationship, good relationship yourself, love
yourself. often hear instance exactly not looking
relationship going find one. hear stuff, right? none
really grounded studies. Again, like sight mind, absence
makes heart grow fonder. many life examples support
statements. many life examples support statements opposite.
particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal
excitement, again, hallmark features autonomic nervous system function,
pleasure, arousal excitement, give rise self-expansion, meaning self-efficacy.
self-expansion model really great people
close romantically attached can potentially make us feel, terms
say, terms do, terms way believe feel us.
doesn't necessarily involve explicit statements telling us great
are, great gestures us, actually feel feel us.
Turns strong parameter terms feel

thing love languages?" Right? don't neuroscience support,


think, love languages, not super familiar this, didn't list out,
people are... autonomic nervous system, will, tends

00:22:06 Strange Situation Task, Childhood Attachment Styles

unless say otherwise, data referring today entirely human
beings. talk attachment attachment styles. will offer
opportunity answer important questions yourself, my,
meaning, attachment style relationship? One robust findings
field psychology notion attachment styles. something
discovered beautiful set studies done Mary Ainsworth
1980s, developed laboratory condition called strange situation task.
Now, strange situation task studied different
cultures, different locations throughout world. preparing episode,
actually spoke three different psychologists. spoke psychoanalyst, spoke
cognitive behavioral psychologist, actually spoke psychiatrist, excuse me, not
psychologist, psychiatrist medical degree asked, strange
situation task various attachment styles emerge task,
still considered valid? indeed three said ever literature
psychology absolutely tamped firm basis data real
world principles real world examples, notion attachment styles.
strange situation task? strange situation task involves parent, typically
mother studies done, parent caregiver bringing child,

third category so-called anxious-ambivalent/resistant-insecure category.
Okay, didn't name categories. blame others one instance.
everything else blame me, instance, blame psychologists
named category. anxious-ambivalent/resistant-insecure category also

caregiver returns, okay? distressed even mother leaves
room tend clingy really hard calm mother

Indeed, is. secure attachment style one leads stable

high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel

moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain

romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,

studies important know autonomic nervous systems

first kind start looking neural synchronization

go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:

space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.

Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair

particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-

Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good

opportunity answer important questions yourself, my,
meaning, attachment style relationship? One robust findings
field psychology notion attachment styles. something
discovered beautiful set studies done Mary Ainsworth
1980s, developed laboratory condition called strange situation task.
Now, strange situation task studied different
cultures, different locations throughout world. preparing episode,

want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory
setting. idea sex drive way forage potential love partners
love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not

mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men

lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might
relationship financial stability isn't quite there, basic
stability isn't there. imagine, instance, situation relationship

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

discovered beautiful set studies done Mary Ainsworth
1980s, developed laboratory condition called strange situation task.
Now, strange situation task studied different

Rockefeller University named Donald Pfaff, P-F-A-F-F, done beautiful studies

Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love
attachment, tend put much value forget many

Fisher others really pointed fact desire, love attachment
three separate phases call romantic relationships. typically, not always,
typically desire tends come first falls early phase. process
romantic/sexual interactions, doesn't necessarily sex itself, certainly
something involves intimacy kind, right? generally touch kind,
eventually transitions call love, eventually transitions
call attachment. just mention touch touch fundamental aspect
whole process. article, research article, say, title is,
"Relationship-specific Encoding Social Touch Somatosensory Insular Cortices."
Cortices cortex. Cortex's plural, cortices. again, friend insula.

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall
category positive delusions. return exactly look like.
also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team
University Washington Seattle. Gottman's have, run laboratory
department psychology long time. also done lot public facing work
around relationships. talked various aspects relationships
interactions people predict either staying together breaking up. much
established method can look video interactions
couples high degree certainty predict whether not
couples will stay together break time. identified call
four horsemen relationships. things essentially, almost always predict
couple will break up. think current number Gottman can
predict divorce 94% accuracy, think pretty remarkable.
even though purely psychological studies, not aware analysis
underlying physiology, things can observe couples
can lead predict whether not couple will stay together break


94% accuracy. things? four behaviors, call Four

defensiveness, three, stonewalling, four, contempt, contempt
powerful predictor breaking up. Criticism, course, not mean no
place criticism stable relationships. course, is.
frequent intensely criticism voiced. Defensiveness, course,
defensiveness. know lack ability hear another adopt stance.
lack empathy, think one way interpret defensiveness. Stonewalling,
actually another form lack empathy. turning off neural circuit
critical desire, love attachment. stonewalling essentially means
emotional response request another completely cut off. it's, don't think
brain imaging this, think, can reasonably imagine involves
untethering insular response dealing with,
focusing insular response, [giggles] no pun intended, internal state
perhaps state someone else entirely. talk infidelity moment.
contempt. contempt actually referred sulfuric acid relationship.

want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory

love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not
neurochemical hormone systems tuned toward particular types behaviors.
mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men
testosterone estrogen, testosterone
women, less estrogen women. Typically women estrogen
testosterone, again, averages. less testosterone men,
estrogen men, forth. hormone systems active
sets individuals. course, humans, far know, manufacture
dopamine serotonin. Dopamine, mentioned earlier, number effects

lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might
relationship financial stability isn't quite there, basic
stability isn't there. imagine, instance, situation relationship

talked earlier previous podcasts, also generally, able adjust

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain

actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

01:47:43 Autonomic Coordination Relationships

exploration fact saying, book, song, example
pretty much relationship dynamic, want now talk article came

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological
studies psychological studies really point that. instance, never say
serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way
yet. cautious assigning without evidence. However,
interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective
measures humans, meaning asking questions good ways tease
lies truths sorts studies whether not people tend find

Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,

three separate phases call romantic relationships. typically, not always,
typically desire tends come first falls early phase. process
romantic/sexual interactions, doesn't necessarily sex itself, certainly

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall

also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team

aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically

match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel

think largely true. look conditions dopamine super

take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy

sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing

unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name

called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation

selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic

Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director

not two individuals match, rather whole

gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened

case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.

Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair

Aron Aron. last name. assuming either

unless say otherwise, data referring today entirely human

opportunity answer important questions yourself, my,
meaning, attachment style relationship? One robust findings
field psychology notion attachment styles. something
discovered beautiful set studies done Mary Ainsworth
1980s, developed laboratory condition called strange situation task.
Now, strange situation task studied different
cultures, different locations throughout world. preparing episode,

Okay, didn't name categories. blame others one instance.

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

simply stance. not basing hardcore neurobiological
mechanism. nonetheless, article published New York Times 2015
related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains
academic science. whole basis article 36 questions lead
love. involved listing indeed 36 questions, divided set one, set two,
set three progressed somewhat ordinary questions life experience
self-report more, call deep questions people's values things
emotionally close them. just give example these.
can find easily online just putting search engine, 36 questions lead
love. questions set number one, instance,
constitute perfect day you? life feel grateful? Kind
standard questionnaire stuff. set two, treasured memory?
terrible memory? these, can tell, drilling little bit deeper

36 things, embarrassing moment life?
last cry front another person yourself? something serious
joked about? going deeper one's emotional system. even questions
like, people family, whose death find disturbing

predict going inside exchange, people creating delusional

even though people just exchanging words, not physically touching,

clear me. think courses literature multiple levels, autonomic

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological
studies psychological studies really point that. instance, never say
serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way
yet. cautious assigning without evidence. However,
interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective
measures humans, meaning asking questions good ways tease
lies truths sorts studies whether not people tend find
partner others less attractive depending people feel

particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal

pleasure, arousal excitement, give rise self-expansion, meaning self-efficacy.
self-expansion model really great people

say, terms do, terms way believe feel us.
doesn't necessarily involve explicit statements telling us great

Turns strong parameter terms feel

Again, attractive alternative partners, literally language title paper,

aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within

hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional

again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone

actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

01:10:02 Positive Delusion, Touch

allow us say, there, want match not?
Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love
attachment, tend put much value forget many

maybe just small set people. delusion? Well, work Helen
Fisher others really pointed fact desire, love attachment
three separate phases call romantic relationships. typically, not always,
typically desire tends come first falls early phase. process
romantic/sexual interactions, doesn't necessarily sex itself, certainly
something involves intimacy kind, right? generally touch kind,
eventually transitions call love, eventually transitions
call attachment. just mention touch touch fundamental aspect
whole process. article, research article, say, title is,
"Relationship-specific Encoding Social Touch Somatosensory Insular Cortices."

way autonomic nervous system can regulated. actually
get access control panel.

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall
category positive delusions. return exactly look like.
also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team

frequent intensely criticism voiced. Defensiveness, course,
defensiveness. know lack ability hear another adopt stance.
lack empathy, think one way interpret defensiveness. Stonewalling,
actually another form lack empathy. turning off neural circuit

want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory
setting. idea sex drive way forage potential love partners
love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not
neurochemical hormone systems tuned toward particular types behaviors.
mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men
testosterone estrogen, testosterone
women, less estrogen women. Typically women estrogen
testosterone, again, averages. less testosterone men,
estrogen men, forth. hormone systems active

dopamine serotonin. Dopamine, mentioned earlier, number effects

hormones make ovaries testes, secrete testosterone estrogen.
lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might
relationship financial stability isn't quite there, basic
stability isn't there. imagine, instance, situation relationship
two people called high serotonin preference

point, wasn't enough dynamic tension sometimes

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

01:10:02 Positive Delusion, Touch

allow us say, there, want match not?
Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love

extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals

number various books. think find useful resources there.
want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory
setting. idea sex drive way forage potential love partners
love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not

mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men

lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might
relationship financial stability isn't quite there, basic
stability isn't there. imagine, instance, situation relationship
two people called high serotonin preference

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat

number various books. think find useful resources there.
want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory
setting. idea sex drive way forage potential love partners
love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not
neurochemical hormone systems tuned toward particular types behaviors.
mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men
testosterone estrogen, testosterone
women, less estrogen women. Typically women estrogen
testosterone, again, averages. less testosterone men,
estrogen men, forth. hormone systems active

hormones make ovaries testes, secrete testosterone estrogen.
lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might
relationship financial stability isn't quite there, basic
stability isn't there. imagine, instance, situation relationship
two people called high serotonin preference

point, wasn't enough dynamic tension sometimes

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat

serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,

identified large number brain areas associated different aspects
desire, love, attachment. just throw names brain areas

neural circuits essential desire, love, attachment. not surprisingly
dopamine system brain associated desire, love, attachment,
mainly desire, although extent, love. Dopamine neurochemical
sometimes associated reward. heard say before,
mainly molecule motivation, craving pursuit. motivation, craving
pursuit relates dopamine not unique attachment, love, sex, mating, et

01:10:02 Positive Delusion, Touch

allow us say, there, want match not?
Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love
attachment, tend put much value forget many

circuits can activated special someone, particular person,
maybe just small set people. delusion? Well, work Helen
Fisher others really pointed fact desire, love attachment
three separate phases call romantic relationships. typically, not always,
typically desire tends come first falls early phase. process
romantic/sexual interactions, doesn't necessarily sex itself, certainly
something involves intimacy kind, right? generally touch kind,
eventually transitions call love, eventually transitions
call attachment. just mention touch touch fundamental aspect
whole process. article, research article, say, title is,
"Relationship-specific Encoding Social Touch Somatosensory Insular Cortices."
Cortices cortex. Cortex's plural, cortices. again, friend insula.

desire love attachment, brain circuitry literally getting tuned
individual happen attached to, again, thinking
monogamous relationships, guess non-monogamous relationship individuals
way autonomic nervous system can regulated. actually
get access control panel.

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall
category positive delusions. return exactly look like.
also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team

frequent intensely criticism voiced. Defensiveness, course,
defensiveness. know lack ability hear another adopt stance.
lack empathy, think one way interpret defensiveness. Stonewalling,
actually another form lack empathy. turning off neural circuit

perhaps state someone else entirely. talk infidelity moment.
contempt. contempt actually referred sulfuric acid relationship.
didn't say that, Gottman colleagues have. powerful predictor
divorce breakups future. contempt, course, definition feeling
person thing beneath consideration, worthlessness deserving scorn.

number various books. think find useful resources there.
want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory
setting. idea sex drive way forage potential love partners
love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not

mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men

lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

00:53:11 Neurobiology Desire, Love & Attachment

one neural circuitries, absolutely crucial autonomic nervous
system. autonomic nervous system one key component desire, love
attachment, two? going tell next largely
pioneering work Helen Fisher, really anthropologist, become bit
neuroscientist collaborated neuroscientists establish brain areas
neural circuits associated different aspects attachment, love desire.
think first really high quality study neural circuits associated themes
paper published 2005 fine anatomical journal, perhaps best neural
anatomical journal, Journal Comparative Neurology. Journal
Comparative Neurology around 100 years considered
archival location placing really high quality anatomy. tremendously high
standards. study referring entitled, "Romantic Love: fMRI,"
meaning functional magnetic resonance imaging, "Study Neural Mechanism
Mate Choice." Dr. Fisher author paper Arthur Aron, Lucy
Brown. fine researchers. study well several studies using
magnetic resonance imaging, things like EEG, neuro anatomical tracing, et cetera,
identified large number brain areas associated different aspects
desire, love, attachment. just throw names brain areas
control. tell anchor two categories
neural circuits essential desire, love, attachment. not surprisingly
dopamine system brain associated desire, love, attachment,
mainly desire, although extent, love. Dopamine neurochemical
sometimes associated reward. heard say before,
mainly molecule motivation, craving pursuit. motivation, craving
pursuit relates dopamine not unique attachment, love, sex, mating, et
cetera. universal generic currency brain pursuing something. Food
hungry, mate want one, mate want to, warmth
cold, et cetera, et cetera, okay? not one specific purpose. brain
areas associated dopamine involve, instance, ventral tegmental area,
substantia nigra, areas sort, basal ganglia. don't need know
names, just understand networks neurons tend put
person, state forward action pursuit craving motivation.


not quiescent, relaxed, et cetera. neural circuits quiescence

Rockefeller University named Donald Pfaff, P-F-A-F-F, done beautiful studies

01:10:02 Positive Delusion, Touch

allow us say, there, want match not?
Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love
attachment, tend put much value forget many

Fisher others really pointed fact desire, love attachment
three separate phases call romantic relationships. typically, not always,
typically desire tends come first falls early phase. process
romantic/sexual interactions, doesn't necessarily sex itself, certainly
something involves intimacy kind, right? generally touch kind,
eventually transitions call love, eventually transitions
call attachment. just mention touch touch fundamental aspect
whole process. article, research article, say, title is,
"Relationship-specific Encoding Social Touch Somatosensory Insular Cortices."
Cortices cortex. Cortex's plural, cortices. again, friend insula.

get access control panel.

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall
category positive delusions. return exactly look like.
also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team

even though purely psychological studies, not aware analysis

powerful predictor breaking up. Criticism, course, not mean no

frequent intensely criticism voiced. Defensiveness, course,
defensiveness. know lack ability hear another adopt stance.
lack empathy, think one way interpret defensiveness. Stonewalling,
actually another form lack empathy. turning off neural circuit

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing

complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes

people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain

studies important know autonomic nervous systems

go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:

kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,

space. fast events can monitored precise location events can

EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point

anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates

experienced believe true sight mind also exists

case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair

statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate

00:53:11 Neurobiology Desire, Love & Attachment

one neural circuitries, absolutely crucial autonomic nervous
system. autonomic nervous system one key component desire, love
attachment, two? going tell next largely
pioneering work Helen Fisher, really anthropologist, become bit
neuroscientist collaborated neuroscientists establish brain areas
neural circuits associated different aspects attachment, love desire.
think first really high quality study neural circuits associated themes
paper published 2005 fine anatomical journal, perhaps best neural
anatomical journal, Journal Comparative Neurology. Journal
Comparative Neurology around 100 years considered
archival location placing really high quality anatomy. tremendously high
standards. study referring entitled, "Romantic Love: fMRI,"
meaning functional magnetic resonance imaging, "Study Neural Mechanism
Mate Choice." Dr. Fisher author paper Arthur Aron, Lucy
Brown. fine researchers. study well several studies using
magnetic resonance imaging, things like EEG, neuro anatomical tracing, et cetera,
identified large number brain areas associated different aspects
desire, love, attachment. just throw names brain areas
control. tell anchor two categories
neural circuits essential desire, love, attachment. not surprisingly
dopamine system brain associated desire, love, attachment,
mainly desire, although extent, love. Dopamine neurochemical
sometimes associated reward. heard say before,
mainly molecule motivation, craving pursuit. motivation, craving
pursuit relates dopamine not unique attachment, love, sex, mating, et
cetera. universal generic currency brain pursuing something. Food
hungry, mate want one, mate want to, warmth
cold, et cetera, et cetera, okay? not one specific purpose. brain
areas associated dopamine involve, instance, ventral tegmental area,
substantia nigra, areas sort, basal ganglia. don't need know
names, just understand networks neurons tend put
person, state forward action pursuit craving motivation.


not quiescent, relaxed, et cetera. neural circuits quiescence

case, mean, actually someone mate with, typically, well, scenarios vary,
typically, one elevated autonomic arousal, meaning increased activation so-
called sympathetic nervous system. related dopamine release related

happens mammalian species mate. Okay, overlooking entire
literature animal studies classic studies done two individuals,
just briefly mention case want look literature. guy
Rockefeller University named Donald Pfaff, P-F-A-F-F, done beautiful studies
identifying neural circuitry, called lordosis response. Unlike humans,
mating behavior animals rather stereotyped terms positions
occupy. lordosis response U-shaping bending hindquarters

associated empathy. neural circuits empathy, again, many,
mainly two structures know about, prefrontal cortex,
perceive things outside us make decisions basis perceptions,
organize decisions, area brain called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.
insula really interesting brain area allows us interocept, pay attention

01:10:02 Positive Delusion, Touch

allow us say, there, want match not?
Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love
attachment, tend put much value forget many
processes going brain body actually evoked many
people too. think somewhat overlooks enormous power attachment
ways somebody's smell, somebody's voice, somebody's everything,


somebody's particular thing things can really become vital autonomic
nervous system feel soothed feel elated, et cetera. think
quote accurate, one sense, think overlook neural circuits
attachment just deeply wired can become us. will balance
quote enormous number quotes won't mention, can
find really point incredible person one tends
attached really one several people ever exist
evoke feelings us. course can read Neruda poetry,
can find things place, music, poetry, writing. every
cynical quote neural circuits generic activated
anybody, think find ample number opposing quotes neural
circuits can activated special someone, particular person,
maybe just small set people. delusion? Well, work Helen
Fisher others really pointed fact desire, love attachment
three separate phases call romantic relationships. typically, not always,
typically desire tends come first falls early phase. process
romantic/sexual interactions, doesn't necessarily sex itself, certainly
something involves intimacy kind, right? generally touch kind,
eventually transitions call love, eventually transitions
call attachment. just mention touch touch fundamental aspect
whole process. article, research article, say, title is,
"Relationship-specific Encoding Social Touch Somatosensory Insular Cortices."
Cortices cortex. Cortex's plural, cortices. again, friend insula.
study explored brain areas body areas activated
specific forms attachment social touch. found not surprisingly
areas brain associated touch, somatosensory areas,
interestingly, insular cortex strongly activated touch. touch
amount touching, proximity, skin contact, not surprisingly activates brain
areas associated somatosensory, touch, also insular cortex, again,

positive delusion predictive long-term attachment. mean positive
delusion? Positive delusion contradiction George Bernard Shaw quote.
belief person can make feel way. person holds
capacity make feel way physically emotionally both. so, move
desire love attachment, brain circuitry literally getting tuned
individual happen attached to, again, thinking
monogamous relationships, guess non-monogamous relationship individuals
way autonomic nervous system can regulated. actually
get access control panel.

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall
category positive delusions. return exactly look like.
also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team
University Washington Seattle. Gottman's have, run laboratory
department psychology long time. also done lot public facing work
around relationships. talked various aspects relationships
interactions people predict either staying together breaking up. much
established method can look video interactions
couples high degree certainty predict whether not
couples will stay together break time. identified call
four horsemen relationships. things essentially, almost always predict
couple will break up. think current number Gottman can
predict divorce 94% accuracy, think pretty remarkable.
even though purely psychological studies, not aware analysis
underlying physiology, things can observe couples
can lead predict whether not couple will stay together break


94% accuracy. things? four behaviors, call Four

powerful predictor breaking up. Criticism, course, not mean no
place criticism stable relationships. course, is.
frequent intensely criticism voiced. Defensiveness, course,
defensiveness. know lack ability hear another adopt stance.
lack empathy, think one way interpret defensiveness. Stonewalling,
actually another form lack empathy. turning off neural circuit
critical desire, love attachment. stonewalling essentially means
emotional response request another completely cut off. it's, don't think
brain imaging this, think, can reasonably imagine involves
untethering insular response dealing with,

perhaps state someone else entirely. talk infidelity moment.
contempt. contempt actually referred sulfuric acid relationship.

organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions

that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love

confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least

frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural

love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know

tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group

hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional

again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

simply stance. not basing hardcore neurobiological
mechanism. nonetheless, article published New York Times 2015
related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains
academic science. whole basis article 36 questions lead
love. involved listing indeed 36 questions, divided set one, set two,
set three progressed somewhat ordinary questions life experience
self-report more, call deep questions people's values things
emotionally close them. just give example these.
can find easily online just putting search engine, 36 questions lead
love. questions set number one, instance,
constitute perfect day you? life feel grateful? Kind
standard questionnaire stuff. set two, treasured memory?
terrible memory? these, can tell, drilling little bit deeper

36 things, embarrassing moment life?

clear me. think courses literature multiple levels, autonomic

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological
studies psychological studies really point that. instance, never say
serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way
yet. cautious assigning without evidence. However,
interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective
measures humans, meaning asking questions good ways tease
lies truths sorts studies whether not people tend find

particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal

pleasure, arousal excitement, give rise self-expansion, meaning self-efficacy.
self-expansion model really great people

say, terms do, terms way believe feel us.
doesn't necessarily involve explicit statements telling us great

Turns strong parameter terms feel

pioneering work Helen Fisher, really anthropologist, become bit
neuroscientist collaborated neuroscientists establish brain areas
neural circuits associated different aspects attachment, love desire.
think first really high quality study neural circuits associated themes

magnetic resonance imaging, things like EEG, neuro anatomical tracing, et cetera,
identified large number brain areas associated different aspects
desire, love, attachment. just throw names brain areas

neural circuits essential desire, love, attachment. not surprisingly
dopamine system brain associated desire, love, attachment,
mainly desire, although extent, love. Dopamine neurochemical
sometimes associated reward. heard say before,
mainly molecule motivation, craving pursuit. motivation, craving
pursuit relates dopamine not unique attachment, love, sex, mating, et
cetera. universal generic currency brain pursuing something. Food
hungry, mate want one, mate want to, warmth

01:10:02 Positive Delusion, Touch

allow us say, there, want match not?
Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love

Fisher others really pointed fact desire, love attachment
three separate phases call romantic relationships. typically, not always,
typically desire tends come first falls early phase. process
romantic/sexual interactions, doesn't necessarily sex itself, certainly
something involves intimacy kind, right? generally touch kind,
eventually transitions call love, eventually transitions
call attachment. just mention touch touch fundamental aspect
whole process. article, research article, say, title is,
"Relationship-specific Encoding Social Touch Somatosensory Insular Cortices."

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall
category positive delusions. return exactly look like.
also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team

defensiveness. know lack ability hear another adopt stance.
lack empathy, think one way interpret defensiveness. Stonewalling,
actually another form lack empathy. turning off neural circuit

meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups

aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look

don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name

three four matters here. interesting seeing different

pair people opposite categories. studies reveal

again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,

meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not

bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,

fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain

things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different

studies important know autonomic nervous systems

first kind start looking neural synchronization

go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:

EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate

large, way done. certainly way done historically
not tens thousands hundreds thousands years. process also
happens mammalian species mate. Okay, overlooking entire
literature animal studies classic studies done two individuals,
just briefly mention case want look literature. guy
Rockefeller University named Donald Pfaff, P-F-A-F-F, done beautiful studies
identifying neural circuitry, called lordosis response. Unlike humans,
mating behavior animals rather stereotyped terms positions
occupy. lordosis response U-shaping bending hindquarters
typically rodents, animals well. male mounting almost
always behind except species primates. lordosis response


going occur particular phases estrous cycle. estrous cycle
analog menstrual cycle, not 28 days, four days
duration animals, depending animal. lordosis response strongly
regulated odors, contact estrogen testosterone controlled.
male portion mating sequence animals, mounting thrusting
ejaculation called mounting, thrusting, intromission ejaculation.
four scientific categories described, presence rodents
also dogs primarily studied Frank Beach, University
California, Berkeley long time. entire literature around neural circuitry
sexual mating behavior animals largely stemmed work Donald Pfaff
Frank Beach scientific offspring, not actual offspring. can look
literature, like. human neuroimaging studies process
described minutes ago, believe not, people brain scanners, not
necessarily mating people, going arc arousal, sympathetic
activation orgasm ejaculation post-ejaculatory orgasmic phase
men women. brain areas associated
mapped now. spinal cord areas control things like erection, vaginal
lubrication, ejaculation orgasm, also mapped out.
explored perspective basic science, just get understanding
species sexual interactions reproduces, also
perspective of, instance, trying repair sexual function spinal cord injury,
prominent concern lot people, depending injury,
number people spinal cord injuries. vital biological
clinical data. neural circuits everything just described reside
autonomic nervous system coordinated neural circuits
associated empathy. neural circuits empathy, again, many,
mainly two structures know about, prefrontal cortex,
perceive things outside us make decisions basis perceptions,
organize decisions, area brain called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.
insula really interesting brain area allows us interocept, pay attention
going inside body split attention, exterocept.
mating dance, whether not dinner date portion mating dance,
actual physical dance part main dance, actual mating sexual behavior,
kissing otherwise, coordinated activity two bodies, typically two.


realize sometimes more, sometimes one, typically two bodies least
framework using here. coordinated dance one

autonomic nervous system individual. insula essentially splitting

thinking bodily sensations other. can communicated,
obviously, words, can communicated sounds, can

depending whether not person's seesaw tilted higher lower
other. Okay, autonomic nervous system, thing
calling empathy, really autonomic matching. again,
insula prefrontal cortex neural circuits crucial autonomic
matching,

01:10:02 Positive Delusion, Touch

allow us say, there, want match not?
Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love
attachment, tend put much value forget many
processes going brain body actually evoked many
people too. think somewhat overlooks enormous power attachment
ways somebody's smell, somebody's voice, somebody's everything,


somebody's particular thing things can really become vital autonomic
nervous system feel soothed feel elated, et cetera. think
quote accurate, one sense, think overlook neural circuits
attachment just deeply wired can become us. will balance
quote enormous number quotes won't mention, can
find really point incredible person one tends
attached really one several people ever exist
evoke feelings us. course can read Neruda poetry,
can find things place, music, poetry, writing. every
cynical quote neural circuits generic activated
anybody, think find ample number opposing quotes neural
circuits can activated special someone, particular person,
maybe just small set people. delusion? Well, work Helen
Fisher others really pointed fact desire, love attachment
three separate phases call romantic relationships. typically, not always,
typically desire tends come first falls early phase. process
romantic/sexual interactions, doesn't necessarily sex itself, certainly
something involves intimacy kind, right? generally touch kind,
eventually transitions call love, eventually transitions
call attachment. just mention touch touch fundamental aspect
whole process. article, research article, say, title is,
"Relationship-specific Encoding Social Touch Somatosensory Insular Cortices."
Cortices cortex. Cortex's plural, cortices. again, friend insula.
study explored brain areas body areas activated
specific forms attachment social touch. found not surprisingly
areas brain associated touch, somatosensory areas,
interestingly, insular cortex strongly activated touch. touch
amount touching, proximity, skin contact, not surprisingly activates brain
areas associated somatosensory, touch, also insular cortex, again,
brain area links internal feelings going inside us
surface skin events external. found activation number
brain areas, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, on. not
essential just understanding insular place start take
experience internal landscape, attach perceptions external


landscape, assign value assign sort interpretation.
positive delusion predictive long-term attachment. mean positive
delusion? Positive delusion contradiction George Bernard Shaw quote.
belief person can make feel way. person holds
capacity make feel way physically emotionally both. so, move
desire love attachment, brain circuitry literally getting tuned
individual happen attached to, again, thinking
monogamous relationships, guess non-monogamous relationship individuals
way autonomic nervous system can regulated. actually
get access control panel.

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall
category positive delusions. return exactly look like.
also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team
University Washington Seattle. Gottman's have, run laboratory
department psychology long time. also done lot public facing work
around relationships. talked various aspects relationships
interactions people predict either staying together breaking up. much
established method can look video interactions
couples high degree certainty predict whether not
couples will stay together break time. identified call
four horsemen relationships. things essentially, almost always predict
couple will break up. think current number Gottman can
predict divorce 94% accuracy, think pretty remarkable.
even though purely psychological studies, not aware analysis
underlying physiology, things can observe couples
can lead predict whether not couple will stay together break


94% accuracy. things? four behaviors, call Four
Horsemen Apocalypse [laughs] relationships one, criticism, two,
defensiveness, three, stonewalling, four, contempt, contempt
powerful predictor breaking up. Criticism, course, not mean no
place criticism stable relationships. course, is.
frequent intensely criticism voiced. Defensiveness, course,
defensiveness. know lack ability hear another adopt stance.
lack empathy, think one way interpret defensiveness. Stonewalling,
actually another form lack empathy. turning off neural circuit
critical desire, love attachment. stonewalling essentially means
emotional response request another completely cut off. it's, don't think
brain imaging this, think, can reasonably imagine involves
untethering insular response dealing with,
focusing insular response, [giggles] no pun intended, internal state
perhaps state someone else entirely. talk infidelity moment.
contempt. contempt actually referred sulfuric acid relationship.
didn't say that, Gottman colleagues have. powerful predictor
divorce breakups future. contempt, course, definition feeling
person thing beneath consideration, worthlessness deserving scorn.
apparently can identify videos couples discussions
interacting elaborate eye rolls, expressions anger one individual
partner actually expressing enthusiasm excitement something. the,
oh yeah, say that, deep seated resentment toward other, much
apparent one actively dislikes partner. contempt, disregard
something taken account way think it. runs
counter neural circuits, three neural circuits talked
before. certainly, antithesis empathy. anything positive delusion.
really looking individual, either accurately inaccurately somebody
despise. absolute inversion autonomic seesaw matching
talking before. dissociating seesaw seesaw.
excited something, unexcited it. fact, inversion
seesaw excited, down. down, up, okay?
basically inversion neural circuits Helen Fisher others
identified critical desire, love, attachment. therefore not surprising


strongly predictive breakups, case married couples, divorce.
interested work Gottman's similar work,
written several popular books. fairly easy find. can link one
caption. also developed quite interesting online resources
so-called Love Lab. guess fortunate didn't call Hate Lab
Breakup Lab, 'cause focused lot predicts breakups. also
written extensively researched extensively peer-reviewed studies makes
people find appropriate partners them, maintain partnerships time.
can go, can search Love Lab, University Washington, Gottman,

01:21:22 Selecting Mates, Recognition Autonomic Tone

number various books. think find useful resources there.
want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory
setting. idea sex drive way forage potential love partners
love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not
neurochemical hormone systems tuned toward particular types behaviors.
mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men
testosterone estrogen, testosterone
women, less estrogen women. Typically women estrogen
testosterone, again, averages. less testosterone men,
estrogen men, forth. hormone systems active
sets individuals. course, humans, far know, manufacture
dopamine serotonin. Dopamine, mentioned earlier, number effects
brain body. one primary effects places us states
motivation pursuit various things. somewhat close relationship
dopamine system testosterone system hypothalamus, brain area
roof mouth. pituitary gland, responsible making
hormones make ovaries testes, secrete testosterone estrogen.
lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might
relationship financial stability isn't quite there, basic
stability isn't there. imagine, instance, situation relationship
two people called high serotonin preference
relationship actually dull, found bored
point, wasn't enough dynamic tension sometimes
required order keep cycle desire, love, attachment going. Something
will talk moment. point not one necessarily pair
according arrangements described. point average,
tends happen. recognition categorizations exist
similar recognition type A, B, C, D infant toddler type attachments
exist, can gain better self-awareness tend show
romantic attachments, thereby navigate healthier mate seeking, healthier


breakups, case dictates it, cases healthy long-term relationships
understanding person can either similar complimentary us. One
neither better other. simply case romantic attachments,
initial inception romantic attachment, desire, love, attachment,
autonomic coordination. course coordination sorts things like
food, sex, sleep, finances, people going live, many
features, core seeking either autonomic likeness
autonomic differences. think recognition can extremely valuable thinking
tools enter maintain relationships. one thinks autonomic
nervous system, not simply something driven external people events,
can actually gain control techniques sort
talked earlier previous podcasts, also generally, able adjust
autonomic nervous system order least appreciate get empathy
someone else experiencing, gain actual cognitive empathy.
episode isn't empathy per se, theme keeps coming again.
think worth mentioning talk psychologists, whether not
psychoanalyst another source training, find don't
talk empathy general term, will talk emotional empathy, talk
cognitive empathy. talking today

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

01:47:43 Autonomic Coordination Relationships

play driving calling desire, love attachment. keeping
exploration fact saying, book, song, example
pretty much relationship dynamic, want now talk article came
little 10 years ago talked universality love ability
fall love. much line George Bernard Shaw quote
mentioned earlier "Love really overestimating differences
individuals." again, say not something personally believe,
although maybe just diluting myself. like think people fall love
really special us, not easily replaced anybody else.


simply stance. not basing hardcore neurobiological
mechanism. nonetheless, article published New York Times 2015
related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains
academic science. whole basis article 36 questions lead
love. involved listing indeed 36 questions, divided set one, set two,
set three progressed somewhat ordinary questions life experience
self-report more, call deep questions people's values things
emotionally close them. just give example these.
can find easily online just putting search engine, 36 questions lead
love. questions set number one, instance,
constitute perfect day you? life feel grateful? Kind
standard questionnaire stuff. set two, treasured memory?
terrible memory? these, can tell, drilling little bit deeper
one's personal experience emotional system. set three, questions 25
36 things, embarrassing moment life?
last cry front another person yourself? something serious
joked about? going deeper one's emotional system. even questions
like, people family, whose death find disturbing
why? pretty, pretty heavy stuff end. Now, reason article got
much traction, reason bringing today statement
made around article two people went date simply sat
asked questions, answered questions
paying attention carefully level emotionally responding not
responding, certainly paying attention answers person,
end exchange, one person asks 36 questions person
answers 36, person asks 36 person answers
36, fall love, right? seems like ridiculous thing. yet
case people go exercise report feeling know
person quite well feeling certain levels attachment even love desire
person were, not predicted, excuse me, not
predicted not gone process. going exchange
questions answers progressively emotional deep level? Well,
predict going inside exchange, people creating delusional


story nature exchange reflection deeper attachment.
even though people just exchanging words, not physically touching,
not, least not point running kinds questionnaire
studies. may touch afterwards know, probably cases,
not exchanging life experience immediate way. not actually going
off world things together yet. simply exchanging narrative.
know based recent studies covered podcast,
mention again, study published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal showing individuals listen narrative, heart
rates tend synchronize least follow similar pattern, even not
room listening given narrative. Whereas case, people facing
one another listening narratives other. Certainly
autonomic responses. stands reason autonomic nervous systems
synchronizing much way Cell Report study found people will
synchronize autonomic nervous systems shared, heard story another.
words, whether not hear story, watch movie, listen song,
exchange individual stories, autonomic nervous systems potential
map onto one another. not surprised people find fall
love, quotes, answering questions one another, essentially
way questions laid establish narrative. establish
personal narrative person listening closely. don't
physiological brain imaging studies support say,
reasonable interpretation causing autonomic synchronization.
want try date even actually hypothesized
useful existing couples, even already know answers
questions. doesn't surprise either. think autonomic coordination

established sharing one's narrative personal experience. don't
want seem overly reductionist. never propose sensation, perception,
action experience life boils us just bags chemicals action
chemicals, aspect nervous system. yet looking across
psychological literature development attachment, psychological literature
adult romantic attachment, makes breaks attachments,


clear me. think courses literature multiple levels, autonomic
coordination absolutely key establishment desire, love attachment.
fact, talked earlier actual conception born autonomic
coordination one sort another. again, doesn't necessarily mean autonomic
nervous systems always synchronized case two categorizations
Fisher proposed director/testosterone type nurturing follower/estrogen

categories led stable attachments seeking

simply required mating behavior also reflected autonomic nervous
system. case, failure coordinate

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological
studies psychological studies really point that. instance, never say
serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way
yet. cautious assigning without evidence. However,
interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective
measures humans, meaning asking questions good ways tease
lies truths sorts studies whether not people tend find
partner others less attractive depending people feel


themselves. think interesting aspect desire, love, attachment
following reason. hear lot order form really strong
relationship, good relationship yourself, love
yourself. often hear instance exactly not looking
relationship going find one. hear stuff, right? none
really grounded studies. Again, like sight mind, absence
makes heart grow fonder. many life examples support
statements. many life examples support statements opposite.
particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal
excitement, again, hallmark features autonomic nervous system function,
pleasure, arousal excitement, give rise self-expansion, meaning self-efficacy.
self-expansion model really great people
close romantically attached can potentially make us feel, terms
say, terms do, terms way believe feel us.
doesn't necessarily involve explicit statements telling us great
are, great gestures us, actually feel feel us.
Turns strong parameter terms feel

thing love languages?" Right? don't neuroscience support,


think, love languages, not super familiar this, didn't list out,
people are... autonomic nervous system, will, tends

01:10:02 Positive Delusion, Touch

allow us say, there, want match not?
Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love
attachment, tend put much value forget many
processes going brain body actually evoked many
people too. think somewhat overlooks enormous power attachment

can find things place, music, poetry, writing. every
cynical quote neural circuits generic activated
anybody, think find ample number opposing quotes neural
circuits can activated special someone, particular person,
maybe just small set people. delusion? Well, work Helen
Fisher others really pointed fact desire, love attachment
three separate phases call romantic relationships. typically, not always,
typically desire tends come first falls early phase. process
romantic/sexual interactions, doesn't necessarily sex itself, certainly
something involves intimacy kind, right? generally touch kind,
eventually transitions call love, eventually transitions
call attachment. just mention touch touch fundamental aspect
whole process. article, research article, say, title is,
"Relationship-specific Encoding Social Touch Somatosensory Insular Cortices."
Cortices cortex. Cortex's plural, cortices. again, friend insula.
study explored brain areas body areas activated

areas brain associated touch, somatosensory areas,
interestingly, insular cortex strongly activated touch. touch

delusion? Positive delusion contradiction George Bernard Shaw quote.
belief person can make feel way. person holds
capacity make feel way physically emotionally both. so, move
desire love attachment, brain circuitry literally getting tuned
individual happen attached to, again, thinking
monogamous relationships, guess non-monogamous relationship individuals
way autonomic nervous system can regulated. actually
get access control panel.

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall
category positive delusions. return exactly look like.
also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team

want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory
setting. idea sex drive way forage potential love partners
love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not

lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

nonetheless, significant positive effect libido dosage 1.5
three grams per day Maca. several studies also show this.
Again, people taking SSRIs people not taking SSRIs, chronically
over-trained athletes, also found case. seems like across
board, Maca fairly useful supplement seeking increase
libido. fewer studies involving women, studies
also point general positive effect libido women taking Maca

02:25:58 Tongkat Ali (Longjack)

indeed can shift levels desire, independent changing levels circulating
hormones. Another substance shown increase libido across range
human populations so-called Tongkat Ali. talked little bit

00:53:11 Neurobiology Desire, Love & Attachment

one neural circuitries, absolutely crucial autonomic nervous
system. autonomic nervous system one key component desire, love
attachment, two? going tell next largely
pioneering work Helen Fisher, really anthropologist, become bit
neuroscientist collaborated neuroscientists establish brain areas
neural circuits associated different aspects attachment, love desire.
think first really high quality study neural circuits associated themes
paper published 2005 fine anatomical journal, perhaps best neural
anatomical journal, Journal Comparative Neurology. Journal
Comparative Neurology around 100 years considered
archival location placing really high quality anatomy. tremendously high
standards. study referring entitled, "Romantic Love: fMRI,"
meaning functional magnetic resonance imaging, "Study Neural Mechanism
Mate Choice." Dr. Fisher author paper Arthur Aron, Lucy
Brown. fine researchers. study well several studies using
magnetic resonance imaging, things like EEG, neuro anatomical tracing, et cetera,
identified large number brain areas associated different aspects
desire, love, attachment. just throw names brain areas
control. tell anchor two categories
neural circuits essential desire, love, attachment. not surprisingly
dopamine system brain associated desire, love, attachment,
mainly desire, although extent, love. Dopamine neurochemical
sometimes associated reward. heard say before,
mainly molecule motivation, craving pursuit. motivation, craving
pursuit relates dopamine not unique attachment, love, sex, mating, et
cetera. universal generic currency brain pursuing something. Food
hungry, mate want one, mate want to, warmth
cold, et cetera, et cetera, okay? not one specific purpose. brain
areas associated dopamine involve, instance, ventral tegmental area,
substantia nigra, areas sort, basal ganglia. don't need know
names, just understand networks neurons tend put
person, state forward action pursuit craving motivation.


not quiescent, relaxed, et cetera. neural circuits quiescence
relaxation associated love attachment, not surprisingly,
neurochemical serotonin, extent, oxytocin predominant
neurochemicals involved. released brain areas, raphe
nucleus back brain. may heard majority serotonin
body made gut, indeed, true, hate break you,
serotonin gut not responsible feelings love attachment, least
not high degree. mainly going reflection neurons brain
make serotonin. areas brain make serotonin well
oxytocin well, tend associated warmth calm,
soothing feel presence another. again, not strictly divided
circuits. can dopamine serotonin present brain body
time equal different degrees. return little bit happens
levels dopamine high levels serotonin low vice versa
on, including states neurochemically modified states, in,
talk things like MDMA, so-called ecstasy. meantime, want just
discuss two neural circuits use dopamine, use serotonin oxytocin,
collaborate autonomic nervous system drive call desire, love
attachment. three circuits autonomic nervous system, talked
one. nervous system components neural circuits
empathy, able see respond indeed match emotional tone
autonomic tone another. third category, might surprise
you, certainly surprised me, data point fact third neural
circuit

00:58:02 Empathy & Mating & Autonomic Nervous System

important establishing bonds one associated positive delusions.
given neural circuits empathy absolutely crucial falling love
maintaining stable attachments, like talk neural circuits
are. Now, often hear empathy, think, oh, empathy really listening
really understanding somebody else feeling. Maybe even feeling
feeling. indeed case, mean that? Right?
feel another feels? Well, means seesaw driving


seesaw, seesaw somehow driving seesaw. match terms
tilt seesaws. Now doesn't exact match, right? someone
really care very, stressed, also become
stressed. form empathic matching, indeed neural circuits
that. describe neural circuits moment. sometimes best role
us take actually one calm person care
romantically involved very, anxious. minutes,
talk matching emotional tone can good bad stability
relationship, complementarity autonomic matching can good bad.
words, sometimes beneficial relationship go state other.
sometimes beneficial us not go state other.
important feature talk emotional matching empathy
going state not going state, really talking
whether not autonomic seesaw one individual driving autonomic
seesaw individual. vital principle fall love
form attachments. actually part desire mating process itself.
go far say one prerequisites propagation expansion
species notion autonomic regulation. extent, matching
autonomic nervous systems. Let explain mean. Last checked, way
new humans can created way sperm meeting egg, either body
dish, sperm meets egg typically nine months later, human baby.
process bringing sperm egg, right? Mating behavior, sex behavior humans
one autonomic regulation. mean process finding mate,
case, mean, actually someone mate with, typically, well, scenarios vary,
typically, one elevated autonomic arousal, meaning increased activation so-
called sympathetic nervous system. related dopamine release related
epinephrine release. pursuit least
mobilization arrive location whereby one can mate, right? almost
always case. However, sexual arousal males females
actually driven primarily parasympathetic arm autonomic nervous system.
pursuit one alertness sympathetic drive, say, again, sympathy
not really play here, word simple means together, activation
autonomic nervous system toward alert state sympathetic
nervous system, meaning co-activation together many neurons brain


spinal cord. actual physiological arousal state call sexual arousal
predominantly parasympathetically driven, okay? quite direct this,
sympathetic nervous system activation high, sexual arousal response cannot
happen either males females, inhibited. However, orgasm ejaculation
response, think required sperm meet egg sympathetic
driven. orgasm ejaculation, parasympathetic nervousness system
kicks back in, calming relaxation. arc mating involves
sympathetic arousal, okay? Not sympathy, alertness arousal pursuit,
tilt seesaw least degree arousal sort typically hear
sexual arousal. point orgasm ejaculation back sympathetic
response. can say that? know that? sympathetic nervous
system meaning neurons within sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system
drive ejaculation orgasm. afterward return increased
parasympathetic activation. don't know sure happens,
thought species pair bond, humans generally pair bond, not always,
return parasympathetic activation orgasm ejaculation thought
increase exchange pheromonal orders, odors, excuse me, increase pillow
talk pair bonding different kinds, okay? seesaw going back forth
actually built process entire species propagates.
ways, every human required navigate process want offspring
persist. course, nowadays technologies like vitro fertilization,
intrauterine insemination, variety ways technology allowed people
circumvent actual physical mating process way described.
large, way done. certainly way done historically
not tens thousands hundreds thousands years. process also
happens mammalian species mate. Okay, overlooking entire
literature animal studies classic studies done two individuals,
just briefly mention case want look literature. guy
Rockefeller University named Donald Pfaff, P-F-A-F-F, done beautiful studies
identifying neural circuitry, called lordosis response. Unlike humans,
mating behavior animals rather stereotyped terms positions
occupy. lordosis response U-shaping bending hindquarters
typically rodents, animals well. male mounting almost
always behind except species primates. lordosis response


going occur particular phases estrous cycle. estrous cycle
analog menstrual cycle, not 28 days, four days
duration animals, depending animal. lordosis response strongly
regulated odors, contact estrogen testosterone controlled.
male portion mating sequence animals, mounting thrusting
ejaculation called mounting, thrusting, intromission ejaculation.
four scientific categories described, presence rodents
also dogs primarily studied Frank Beach, University
California, Berkeley long time. entire literature around neural circuitry
sexual mating behavior animals largely stemmed work Donald Pfaff
Frank Beach scientific offspring, not actual offspring. can look
literature, like. human neuroimaging studies process
described minutes ago, believe not, people brain scanners, not
necessarily mating people, going arc arousal, sympathetic
activation orgasm ejaculation post-ejaculatory orgasmic phase
men women. brain areas associated
mapped now. spinal cord areas control things like erection, vaginal
lubrication, ejaculation orgasm, also mapped out.
explored perspective basic science, just get understanding
species sexual interactions reproduces, also
perspective of, instance, trying repair sexual function spinal cord injury,
prominent concern lot people, depending injury,
number people spinal cord injuries. vital biological
clinical data. neural circuits everything just described reside
autonomic nervous system coordinated neural circuits
associated empathy. neural circuits empathy, again, many,
mainly two structures know about, prefrontal cortex,
perceive things outside us make decisions basis perceptions,
organize decisions, area brain called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.
insula really interesting brain area allows us interocept, pay attention
going inside body split attention, exterocept.
mating dance, whether not dinner date portion mating dance,
actual physical dance part main dance, actual mating sexual behavior,
kissing otherwise, coordinated activity two bodies, typically two.


realize sometimes more, sometimes one, typically two bodies least
framework using here. coordinated dance one
autonomic nervous system one individual general coordinating
autonomic nervous system individual. insula essentially splitting

thinking bodily sensations other. can communicated,
obviously, words, can communicated sounds, can

calling empathy, really autonomic matching. again,
insula prefrontal cortex neural circuits crucial autonomic
matching,

01:10:02 Positive Delusion, Touch

allow us say, there, want match not?
Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love
attachment, tend put much value forget many
processes going brain body actually evoked many
people too. think somewhat overlooks enormous power attachment
ways somebody's smell, somebody's voice, somebody's everything,


somebody's particular thing things can really become vital autonomic
nervous system feel soothed feel elated, et cetera. think
quote accurate, one sense, think overlook neural circuits
attachment just deeply wired can become us. will balance
quote enormous number quotes won't mention, can
find really point incredible person one tends
attached really one several people ever exist
evoke feelings us. course can read Neruda poetry,
can find things place, music, poetry, writing. every
cynical quote neural circuits generic activated
anybody, think find ample number opposing quotes neural
circuits can activated special someone, particular person,
maybe just small set people. delusion? Well, work Helen
Fisher others really pointed fact desire, love attachment
three separate phases call romantic relationships. typically, not always,
typically desire tends come first falls early phase. process
romantic/sexual interactions, doesn't necessarily sex itself, certainly
something involves intimacy kind, right? generally touch kind,
eventually transitions call love, eventually transitions
call attachment. just mention touch touch fundamental aspect
whole process. article, research article, say, title is,
"Relationship-specific Encoding Social Touch Somatosensory Insular Cortices."
Cortices cortex. Cortex's plural, cortices. again, friend insula.
study explored brain areas body areas activated
specific forms attachment social touch. found not surprisingly
areas brain associated touch, somatosensory areas,
interestingly, insular cortex strongly activated touch. touch
amount touching, proximity, skin contact, not surprisingly activates brain
areas associated somatosensory, touch, also insular cortex, again,
brain area links internal feelings going inside us
surface skin events external. found activation number
brain areas, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, on. not
essential just understanding insular place start take
experience internal landscape, attach perceptions external


landscape, assign value assign sort interpretation.
positive delusion predictive long-term attachment. mean positive
delusion? Positive delusion contradiction George Bernard Shaw quote.
belief person can make feel way. person holds
capacity make feel way physically emotionally both. so, move
desire love attachment, brain circuitry literally getting tuned
individual happen attached to, again, thinking
monogamous relationships, guess non-monogamous relationship individuals
way autonomic nervous system can regulated. actually
get access control panel.

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall
category positive delusions. return exactly look like.
also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team
University Washington Seattle. Gottman's have, run laboratory
department psychology long time. also done lot public facing work
around relationships. talked various aspects relationships
interactions people predict either staying together breaking up. much
established method can look video interactions
couples high degree certainty predict whether not
couples will stay together break time. identified call
four horsemen relationships. things essentially, almost always predict
couple will break up. think current number Gottman can
predict divorce 94% accuracy, think pretty remarkable.
even though purely psychological studies, not aware analysis
underlying physiology, things can observe couples
can lead predict whether not couple will stay together break


94% accuracy. things? four behaviors, call Four
Horsemen Apocalypse [laughs] relationships one, criticism, two,
defensiveness, three, stonewalling, four, contempt, contempt
powerful predictor breaking up. Criticism, course, not mean no
place criticism stable relationships. course, is.
frequent intensely criticism voiced. Defensiveness, course,
defensiveness. know lack ability hear another adopt stance.
lack empathy, think one way interpret defensiveness. Stonewalling,
actually another form lack empathy. turning off neural circuit
critical desire, love attachment. stonewalling essentially means
emotional response request another completely cut off. it's, don't think
brain imaging this, think, can reasonably imagine involves
untethering insular response dealing with,
focusing insular response, [giggles] no pun intended, internal state
perhaps state someone else entirely. talk infidelity moment.
contempt. contempt actually referred sulfuric acid relationship.
didn't say that, Gottman colleagues have. powerful predictor
divorce breakups future. contempt, course, definition feeling
person thing beneath consideration, worthlessness deserving scorn.
apparently can identify videos couples discussions
interacting elaborate eye rolls, expressions anger one individual
partner actually expressing enthusiasm excitement something. the,
oh yeah, say that, deep seated resentment toward other, much
apparent one actively dislikes partner. contempt, disregard
something taken account way think it. runs
counter neural circuits, three neural circuits talked
before. certainly, antithesis empathy. anything positive delusion.
really looking individual, either accurately inaccurately somebody
despise. absolute inversion autonomic seesaw matching
talking before. dissociating seesaw seesaw.
excited something, unexcited it. fact, inversion
seesaw excited, down. down, up, okay?
basically inversion neural circuits Helen Fisher others
identified critical desire, love, attachment. therefore not surprising


strongly predictive breakups, case married couples, divorce.
interested work Gottman's similar work,
written several popular books. fairly easy find. can link one
caption. also developed quite interesting online resources
so-called Love Lab. guess fortunate didn't call Hate Lab
Breakup Lab, 'cause focused lot predicts breakups. also
written extensively researched extensively peer-reviewed studies makes
people find appropriate partners them, maintain partnerships time.
can go, can search Love Lab, University Washington, Gottman,

01:21:22 Selecting Mates, Recognition Autonomic Tone

number various books. think find useful resources there.
want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory
setting. idea sex drive way forage potential love partners
love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not
neurochemical hormone systems tuned toward particular types behaviors.
mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men
testosterone estrogen, testosterone
women, less estrogen women. Typically women estrogen
testosterone, again, averages. less testosterone men,
estrogen men, forth. hormone systems active
sets individuals. course, humans, far know, manufacture
dopamine serotonin. Dopamine, mentioned earlier, number effects
brain body. one primary effects places us states
motivation pursuit various things. somewhat close relationship
dopamine system testosterone system hypothalamus, brain area
roof mouth. pituitary gland, responsible making
hormones make ovaries testes, secrete testosterone estrogen.
lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might
relationship financial stability isn't quite there, basic
stability isn't there. imagine, instance, situation relationship
two people called high serotonin preference
relationship actually dull, found bored
point, wasn't enough dynamic tension sometimes
required order keep cycle desire, love, attachment going. Something
will talk moment. point not one necessarily pair
according arrangements described. point average,
tends happen. recognition categorizations exist
similar recognition type A, B, C, D infant toddler type attachments

romantic attachments, thereby navigate healthier mate seeking, healthier


breakups, case dictates it, cases healthy long-term relationships
understanding person can either similar complimentary us. One
neither better other. simply case romantic attachments,
initial inception romantic attachment, desire, love, attachment,
autonomic coordination. course coordination sorts things like

autonomic differences. think recognition can extremely valuable thinking
tools enter maintain relationships. one thinks autonomic
nervous system, not simply something driven external people events,
can actually gain control techniques sort
talked earlier previous podcasts, also generally, able adjust
autonomic nervous system order least appreciate get empathy
someone else experiencing, gain actual cognitive empathy.
episode isn't empathy per se, theme keeps coming again.
think worth mentioning talk psychologists, whether not
psychoanalyst another source training, find don't
talk empathy general term, will talk emotional empathy, talk
cognitive empathy. talking today

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain

studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known

study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:

EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs

particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-

Aron Aron. last name. assuming either

O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good

identifying neural circuitry, called lordosis response. Unlike humans,
mating behavior animals rather stereotyped terms positions
occupy. lordosis response U-shaping bending hindquarters
typically rodents, animals well. male mounting almost
always behind except species primates. lordosis response


going occur particular phases estrous cycle. estrous cycle
analog menstrual cycle, not 28 days, four days
duration animals, depending animal. lordosis response strongly
regulated odors, contact estrogen testosterone controlled.
male portion mating sequence animals, mounting thrusting
ejaculation called mounting, thrusting, intromission ejaculation.
four scientific categories described, presence rodents
also dogs primarily studied Frank Beach, University
California, Berkeley long time. entire literature around neural circuitry
sexual mating behavior animals largely stemmed work Donald Pfaff
Frank Beach scientific offspring, not actual offspring. can look
literature, like. human neuroimaging studies process
described minutes ago, believe not, people brain scanners, not
necessarily mating people, going arc arousal, sympathetic
activation orgasm ejaculation post-ejaculatory orgasmic phase
men women. brain areas associated
mapped now. spinal cord areas control things like erection, vaginal
lubrication, ejaculation orgasm, also mapped out.
explored perspective basic science, just get understanding
species sexual interactions reproduces, also
perspective of, instance, trying repair sexual function spinal cord injury,
prominent concern lot people, depending injury,
number people spinal cord injuries. vital biological
clinical data. neural circuits everything just described reside
autonomic nervous system coordinated neural circuits
associated empathy. neural circuits empathy, again, many,
mainly two structures know about, prefrontal cortex,
perceive things outside us make decisions basis perceptions,
organize decisions, area brain called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.
insula really interesting brain area allows us interocept, pay attention
going inside body split attention, exterocept.
mating dance, whether not dinner date portion mating dance,
actual physical dance part main dance, actual mating sexual behavior,
kissing otherwise, coordinated activity two bodies, typically two.


realize sometimes more, sometimes one, typically two bodies least
framework using here. coordinated dance one
autonomic nervous system one individual general coordinating
autonomic nervous system individual. insula essentially splitting
one's attention feel ourselves, body feels, thinking
thinking bodily sensations other. can communicated,
obviously, words, can communicated sounds, can
communicated touch, can communicated number
subtle cues like pupil size whether not, certainly cases recognize
person know responses, autonomic responses different
conditions. can assess, person comfortable? uncomfortable?
focused themselves? coordinated silent dance
look neurobiological terms, can really see autonomic
nervous system, whether not time tip seesaw one side other,
depending whether not person's seesaw tilted higher lower
other. Okay, autonomic nervous system, thing
calling empathy, really autonomic matching. again,
insula prefrontal cortex neural circuits crucial autonomic
matching,

01:10:02 Positive Delusion, Touch

allow us say, there, want match not?
Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love
attachment, tend put much value forget many
processes going brain body actually evoked many
people too. think somewhat overlooks enormous power attachment
ways somebody's smell, somebody's voice, somebody's everything,


somebody's particular thing things can really become vital autonomic
nervous system feel soothed feel elated, et cetera. think
quote accurate, one sense, think overlook neural circuits
attachment just deeply wired can become us. will balance
quote enormous number quotes won't mention, can
find really point incredible person one tends
attached really one several people ever exist
evoke feelings us. course can read Neruda poetry,
can find things place, music, poetry, writing. every
cynical quote neural circuits generic activated
anybody, think find ample number opposing quotes neural
circuits can activated special someone, particular person,
maybe just small set people. delusion? Well, work Helen
Fisher others really pointed fact desire, love attachment
three separate phases call romantic relationships. typically, not always,
typically desire tends come first falls early phase. process
romantic/sexual interactions, doesn't necessarily sex itself, certainly
something involves intimacy kind, right? generally touch kind,
eventually transitions call love, eventually transitions
call attachment. just mention touch touch fundamental aspect
whole process. article, research article, say, title is,
"Relationship-specific Encoding Social Touch Somatosensory Insular Cortices."
Cortices cortex. Cortex's plural, cortices. again, friend insula.
study explored brain areas body areas activated
specific forms attachment social touch. found not surprisingly
areas brain associated touch, somatosensory areas,
interestingly, insular cortex strongly activated touch. touch
amount touching, proximity, skin contact, not surprisingly activates brain
areas associated somatosensory, touch, also insular cortex, again,
brain area links internal feelings going inside us
surface skin events external. found activation number
brain areas, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, on. not
essential just understanding insular place start take
experience internal landscape, attach perceptions external


landscape, assign value assign sort interpretation.
positive delusion predictive long-term attachment. mean positive
delusion? Positive delusion contradiction George Bernard Shaw quote.
belief person can make feel way. person holds
capacity make feel way physically emotionally both. so, move
desire love attachment, brain circuitry literally getting tuned
individual happen attached to, again, thinking
monogamous relationships, guess non-monogamous relationship individuals
way autonomic nervous system can regulated. actually
get access control panel.

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall
category positive delusions. return exactly look like.
also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team
University Washington Seattle. Gottman's have, run laboratory
department psychology long time. also done lot public facing work
around relationships. talked various aspects relationships
interactions people predict either staying together breaking up. much
established method can look video interactions
couples high degree certainty predict whether not
couples will stay together break time. identified call
four horsemen relationships. things essentially, almost always predict
couple will break up. think current number Gottman can
predict divorce 94% accuracy, think pretty remarkable.
even though purely psychological studies, not aware analysis
underlying physiology, things can observe couples
can lead predict whether not couple will stay together break


94% accuracy. things? four behaviors, call Four
Horsemen Apocalypse [laughs] relationships one, criticism, two,
defensiveness, three, stonewalling, four, contempt, contempt
powerful predictor breaking up. Criticism, course, not mean no
place criticism stable relationships. course, is.
frequent intensely criticism voiced. Defensiveness, course,
defensiveness. know lack ability hear another adopt stance.
lack empathy, think one way interpret defensiveness. Stonewalling,
actually another form lack empathy. turning off neural circuit
critical desire, love attachment. stonewalling essentially means
emotional response request another completely cut off. it's, don't think
brain imaging this, think, can reasonably imagine involves
untethering insular response dealing with,
focusing insular response, [giggles] no pun intended, internal state
perhaps state someone else entirely. talk infidelity moment.
contempt. contempt actually referred sulfuric acid relationship.
didn't say that, Gottman colleagues have. powerful predictor
divorce breakups future. contempt, course, definition feeling
person thing beneath consideration, worthlessness deserving scorn.
apparently can identify videos couples discussions
interacting elaborate eye rolls, expressions anger one individual
partner actually expressing enthusiasm excitement something. the,
oh yeah, say that, deep seated resentment toward other, much
apparent one actively dislikes partner. contempt, disregard
something taken account way think it. runs
counter neural circuits, three neural circuits talked
before. certainly, antithesis empathy. anything positive delusion.
really looking individual, either accurately inaccurately somebody
despise. absolute inversion autonomic seesaw matching
talking before. dissociating seesaw seesaw.
excited something, unexcited it. fact, inversion
seesaw excited, down. down, up, okay?
basically inversion neural circuits Helen Fisher others
identified critical desire, love, attachment. therefore not surprising


strongly predictive breakups, case married couples, divorce.
interested work Gottman's similar work,
written several popular books. fairly easy find. can link one
caption. also developed quite interesting online resources
so-called Love Lab. guess fortunate didn't call Hate Lab
Breakup Lab, 'cause focused lot predicts breakups. also
written extensively researched extensively peer-reviewed studies makes
people find appropriate partners them, maintain partnerships time.
can go, can search Love Lab, University Washington, Gottman,

01:21:22 Selecting Mates, Recognition Autonomic Tone

number various books. think find useful resources there.
want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory
setting. idea sex drive way forage potential love partners
love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not
neurochemical hormone systems tuned toward particular types behaviors.
mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men
testosterone estrogen, testosterone
women, less estrogen women. Typically women estrogen
testosterone, again, averages. less testosterone men,
estrogen men, forth. hormone systems active
sets individuals. course, humans, far know, manufacture
dopamine serotonin. Dopamine, mentioned earlier, number effects
brain body. one primary effects places us states
motivation pursuit various things. somewhat close relationship
dopamine system testosterone system hypothalamus, brain area
roof mouth. pituitary gland, responsible making
hormones make ovaries testes, secrete testosterone estrogen.
lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might
relationship financial stability isn't quite there, basic
stability isn't there. imagine, instance, situation relationship
two people called high serotonin preference
relationship actually dull, found bored
point, wasn't enough dynamic tension sometimes
required order keep cycle desire, love, attachment going. Something
will talk moment. point not one necessarily pair
according arrangements described. point average,
tends happen. recognition categorizations exist
similar recognition type A, B, C, D infant toddler type attachments
exist, can gain better self-awareness tend show
romantic attachments, thereby navigate healthier mate seeking, healthier


breakups, case dictates it, cases healthy long-term relationships
understanding person can either similar complimentary us. One
neither better other. simply case romantic attachments,
initial inception romantic attachment, desire, love, attachment,
autonomic coordination. course coordination sorts things like
food, sex, sleep, finances, people going live, many
features, core seeking either autonomic likeness
autonomic differences. think recognition can extremely valuable thinking
tools enter maintain relationships. one thinks autonomic
nervous system, not simply something driven external people events,
can actually gain control techniques sort
talked earlier previous podcasts, also generally, able adjust
autonomic nervous system order least appreciate get empathy
someone else experiencing, gain actual cognitive empathy.
episode isn't empathy per se, theme keeps coming again.
think worth mentioning talk psychologists, whether not
psychoanalyst another source training, find don't
talk empathy general term, will talk emotional empathy, talk
cognitive empathy. talking today

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

01:47:43 Autonomic Coordination Relationships

play driving calling desire, love attachment. keeping
exploration fact saying, book, song, example
pretty much relationship dynamic, want now talk article came
little 10 years ago talked universality love ability
fall love. much line George Bernard Shaw quote
mentioned earlier "Love really overestimating differences
individuals." again, say not something personally believe,
although maybe just diluting myself. like think people fall love
really special us, not easily replaced anybody else.


simply stance. not basing hardcore neurobiological
mechanism. nonetheless, article published New York Times 2015
related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains
academic science. whole basis article 36 questions lead
love. involved listing indeed 36 questions, divided set one, set two,
set three progressed somewhat ordinary questions life experience
self-report more, call deep questions people's values things
emotionally close them. just give example these.
can find easily online just putting search engine, 36 questions lead
love. questions set number one, instance,
constitute perfect day you? life feel grateful? Kind
standard questionnaire stuff. set two, treasured memory?
terrible memory? these, can tell, drilling little bit deeper
one's personal experience emotional system. set three, questions 25
36 things, embarrassing moment life?
last cry front another person yourself? something serious
joked about? going deeper one's emotional system. even questions
like, people family, whose death find disturbing
why? pretty, pretty heavy stuff end. Now, reason article got
much traction, reason bringing today statement
made around article two people went date simply sat
asked questions, answered questions
paying attention carefully level emotionally responding not
responding, certainly paying attention answers person,
end exchange, one person asks 36 questions person
answers 36, person asks 36 person answers
36, fall love, right? seems like ridiculous thing. yet
case people go exercise report feeling know
person quite well feeling certain levels attachment even love desire
person were, not predicted, excuse me, not
predicted not gone process. going exchange
questions answers progressively emotional deep level? Well,
predict going inside exchange, people creating delusional


story nature exchange reflection deeper attachment.
even though people just exchanging words, not physically touching,
not, least not point running kinds questionnaire
studies. may touch afterwards know, probably cases,
not exchanging life experience immediate way. not actually going
off world things together yet. simply exchanging narrative.
know based recent studies covered podcast,
mention again, study published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal showing individuals listen narrative, heart
rates tend synchronize least follow similar pattern, even not
room listening given narrative. Whereas case, people facing

psychological literature development attachment, psychological literature
adult romantic attachment, makes breaks attachments,


clear me. think courses literature multiple levels, autonomic
coordination absolutely key establishment desire, love attachment.
fact, talked earlier actual conception born autonomic
coordination one sort another. again, doesn't necessarily mean autonomic

Fisher proposed director/testosterone type nurturing follower/estrogen

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological
studies psychological studies really point that. instance, never say
serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way
yet. cautious assigning without evidence. However,
interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective
measures humans, meaning asking questions good ways tease
lies truths sorts studies whether not people tend find
partner others less attractive depending people feel


themselves. think interesting aspect desire, love, attachment
following reason. hear lot order form really strong
relationship, good relationship yourself, love
yourself. often hear instance exactly not looking
relationship going find one. hear stuff, right? none
really grounded studies. Again, like sight mind, absence
makes heart grow fonder. many life examples support
statements. many life examples support statements opposite.
particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal
excitement, again, hallmark features autonomic nervous system function,
pleasure, arousal excitement, give rise self-expansion, meaning self-efficacy.
self-expansion model really great people
close romantically attached can potentially make us feel, terms
say, terms do, terms way believe feel us.
doesn't necessarily involve explicit statements telling us great

Turns strong parameter terms feel

think, love languages, not super familiar this, didn't list out,

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall

also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team

couples will stay together break time. identified call
four horsemen relationships. things essentially, almost always predict

even though purely psychological studies, not aware analysis

can lead predict whether not couple will stay together break


94% accuracy. things? four behaviors, call Four

powerful predictor breaking up. Criticism, course, not mean no

defensiveness. know lack ability hear another adopt stance.
lack empathy, think one way interpret defensiveness. Stonewalling,
actually another form lack empathy. turning off neural circuit

want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting

species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory

love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups

aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different

preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.

Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others

serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way

interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective

particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-

Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good

spinal cord. actual physiological arousal state call sexual arousal
predominantly parasympathetically driven, okay? quite direct this,
sympathetic nervous system activation high, sexual arousal response cannot
happen either males females, inhibited. However, orgasm ejaculation
response, think required sperm meet egg sympathetic
driven. orgasm ejaculation, parasympathetic nervousness system
kicks back in, calming relaxation. arc mating involves
sympathetic arousal, okay? Not sympathy, alertness arousal pursuit,
tilt seesaw least degree arousal sort typically hear
sexual arousal. point orgasm ejaculation back sympathetic
response. can say that? know that? sympathetic nervous
system meaning neurons within sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system
drive ejaculation orgasm. afterward return increased
parasympathetic activation. don't know sure happens,
thought species pair bond, humans generally pair bond, not always,
return parasympathetic activation orgasm ejaculation thought
increase exchange pheromonal orders, odors, excuse me, increase pillow
talk pair bonding different kinds, okay? seesaw going back forth
actually built process entire species propagates.
ways, every human required navigate process want offspring
persist. course, nowadays technologies like vitro fertilization,
intrauterine insemination, variety ways technology allowed people
circumvent actual physical mating process way described.
large, way done. certainly way done historically
not tens thousands hundreds thousands years. process also
happens mammalian species mate. Okay, overlooking entire
literature animal studies classic studies done two individuals,
just briefly mention case want look literature. guy
Rockefeller University named Donald Pfaff, P-F-A-F-F, done beautiful studies
identifying neural circuitry, called lordosis response. Unlike humans,
mating behavior animals rather stereotyped terms positions
occupy. lordosis response U-shaping bending hindquarters
typically rodents, animals well. male mounting almost
always behind except species primates. lordosis response


going occur particular phases estrous cycle. estrous cycle
analog menstrual cycle, not 28 days, four days
duration animals, depending animal. lordosis response strongly
regulated odors, contact estrogen testosterone controlled.
male portion mating sequence animals, mounting thrusting
ejaculation called mounting, thrusting, intromission ejaculation.
four scientific categories described, presence rodents
also dogs primarily studied Frank Beach, University
California, Berkeley long time. entire literature around neural circuitry
sexual mating behavior animals largely stemmed work Donald Pfaff
Frank Beach scientific offspring, not actual offspring. can look
literature, like. human neuroimaging studies process
described minutes ago, believe not, people brain scanners, not
necessarily mating people, going arc arousal, sympathetic
activation orgasm ejaculation post-ejaculatory orgasmic phase
men women. brain areas associated
mapped now. spinal cord areas control things like erection, vaginal
lubrication, ejaculation orgasm, also mapped out.
explored perspective basic science, just get understanding
species sexual interactions reproduces, also
perspective of, instance, trying repair sexual function spinal cord injury,
prominent concern lot people, depending injury,
number people spinal cord injuries. vital biological
clinical data. neural circuits everything just described reside
autonomic nervous system coordinated neural circuits
associated empathy. neural circuits empathy, again, many,
mainly two structures know about, prefrontal cortex,
perceive things outside us make decisions basis perceptions,
organize decisions, area brain called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.
insula really interesting brain area allows us interocept, pay attention
going inside body split attention, exterocept.
mating dance, whether not dinner date portion mating dance,
actual physical dance part main dance, actual mating sexual behavior,
kissing otherwise, coordinated activity two bodies, typically two.


realize sometimes more, sometimes one, typically two bodies least
framework using here. coordinated dance one
autonomic nervous system one individual general coordinating
autonomic nervous system individual. insula essentially splitting
one's attention feel ourselves, body feels, thinking
thinking bodily sensations other. can communicated,
obviously, words, can communicated sounds, can
communicated touch, can communicated number
subtle cues like pupil size whether not, certainly cases recognize
person know responses, autonomic responses different
conditions. can assess, person comfortable? uncomfortable?
focused themselves? coordinated silent dance
look neurobiological terms, can really see autonomic
nervous system, whether not time tip seesaw one side other,
depending whether not person's seesaw tilted higher lower
other. Okay, autonomic nervous system, thing
calling empathy, really autonomic matching. again,
insula prefrontal cortex neural circuits crucial autonomic
matching,

01:10:02 Positive Delusion, Touch

allow us say, there, want match not?
Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love
attachment, tend put much value forget many
processes going brain body actually evoked many
people too. think somewhat overlooks enormous power attachment
ways somebody's smell, somebody's voice, somebody's everything,


somebody's particular thing things can really become vital autonomic
nervous system feel soothed feel elated, et cetera. think
quote accurate, one sense, think overlook neural circuits
attachment just deeply wired can become us. will balance
quote enormous number quotes won't mention, can
find really point incredible person one tends
attached really one several people ever exist
evoke feelings us. course can read Neruda poetry,
can find things place, music, poetry, writing. every
cynical quote neural circuits generic activated
anybody, think find ample number opposing quotes neural
circuits can activated special someone, particular person,
maybe just small set people. delusion? Well, work Helen
Fisher others really pointed fact desire, love attachment
three separate phases call romantic relationships. typically, not always,
typically desire tends come first falls early phase. process
romantic/sexual interactions, doesn't necessarily sex itself, certainly
something involves intimacy kind, right? generally touch kind,
eventually transitions call love, eventually transitions
call attachment. just mention touch touch fundamental aspect
whole process. article, research article, say, title is,
"Relationship-specific Encoding Social Touch Somatosensory Insular Cortices."
Cortices cortex. Cortex's plural, cortices. again, friend insula.
study explored brain areas body areas activated
specific forms attachment social touch. found not surprisingly
areas brain associated touch, somatosensory areas,
interestingly, insular cortex strongly activated touch. touch
amount touching, proximity, skin contact, not surprisingly activates brain
areas associated somatosensory, touch, also insular cortex, again,
brain area links internal feelings going inside us
surface skin events external. found activation number
brain areas, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, on. not
essential just understanding insular place start take
experience internal landscape, attach perceptions external


landscape, assign value assign sort interpretation.
positive delusion predictive long-term attachment. mean positive
delusion? Positive delusion contradiction George Bernard Shaw quote.
belief person can make feel way. person holds
capacity make feel way physically emotionally both. so, move
desire love attachment, brain circuitry literally getting tuned
individual happen attached to, again, thinking
monogamous relationships, guess non-monogamous relationship individuals
way autonomic nervous system can regulated. actually
get access control panel.

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall
category positive delusions. return exactly look like.
also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team
University Washington Seattle. Gottman's have, run laboratory
department psychology long time. also done lot public facing work
around relationships. talked various aspects relationships
interactions people predict either staying together breaking up. much
established method can look video interactions
couples high degree certainty predict whether not
couples will stay together break time. identified call
four horsemen relationships. things essentially, almost always predict
couple will break up. think current number Gottman can
predict divorce 94% accuracy, think pretty remarkable.
even though purely psychological studies, not aware analysis
underlying physiology, things can observe couples
can lead predict whether not couple will stay together break


94% accuracy. things? four behaviors, call Four
Horsemen Apocalypse [laughs] relationships one, criticism, two,
defensiveness, three, stonewalling, four, contempt, contempt
powerful predictor breaking up. Criticism, course, not mean no
place criticism stable relationships. course, is.
frequent intensely criticism voiced. Defensiveness, course,
defensiveness. know lack ability hear another adopt stance.
lack empathy, think one way interpret defensiveness. Stonewalling,
actually another form lack empathy. turning off neural circuit
critical desire, love attachment. stonewalling essentially means
emotional response request another completely cut off. it's, don't think
brain imaging this, think, can reasonably imagine involves
untethering insular response dealing with,
focusing insular response, [giggles] no pun intended, internal state
perhaps state someone else entirely. talk infidelity moment.
contempt. contempt actually referred sulfuric acid relationship.
didn't say that, Gottman colleagues have. powerful predictor
divorce breakups future. contempt, course, definition feeling
person thing beneath consideration, worthlessness deserving scorn.
apparently can identify videos couples discussions
interacting elaborate eye rolls, expressions anger one individual
partner actually expressing enthusiasm excitement something. the,
oh yeah, say that, deep seated resentment toward other, much
apparent one actively dislikes partner. contempt, disregard
something taken account way think it. runs
counter neural circuits, three neural circuits talked
before. certainly, antithesis empathy. anything positive delusion.
really looking individual, either accurately inaccurately somebody
despise. absolute inversion autonomic seesaw matching
talking before. dissociating seesaw seesaw.
excited something, unexcited it. fact, inversion
seesaw excited, down. down, up, okay?
basically inversion neural circuits Helen Fisher others
identified critical desire, love, attachment. therefore not surprising


strongly predictive breakups, case married couples, divorce.
interested work Gottman's similar work,
written several popular books. fairly easy find. can link one
caption. also developed quite interesting online resources
so-called Love Lab. guess fortunate didn't call Hate Lab
Breakup Lab, 'cause focused lot predicts breakups. also
written extensively researched extensively peer-reviewed studies makes
people find appropriate partners them, maintain partnerships time.
can go, can search Love Lab, University Washington, Gottman,

01:21:22 Selecting Mates, Recognition Autonomic Tone

number various books. think find useful resources there.
want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory
setting. idea sex drive way forage potential love partners
love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not
neurochemical hormone systems tuned toward particular types behaviors.
mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men
testosterone estrogen, testosterone
women, less estrogen women. Typically women estrogen
testosterone, again, averages. less testosterone men,
estrogen men, forth. hormone systems active
sets individuals. course, humans, far know, manufacture
dopamine serotonin. Dopamine, mentioned earlier, number effects
brain body. one primary effects places us states
motivation pursuit various things. somewhat close relationship
dopamine system testosterone system hypothalamus, brain area
roof mouth. pituitary gland, responsible making
hormones make ovaries testes, secrete testosterone estrogen.
lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might
relationship financial stability isn't quite there, basic
stability isn't there. imagine, instance, situation relationship
two people called high serotonin preference
relationship actually dull, found bored
point, wasn't enough dynamic tension sometimes
required order keep cycle desire, love, attachment going. Something
will talk moment. point not one necessarily pair
according arrangements described. point average,
tends happen. recognition categorizations exist
similar recognition type A, B, C, D infant toddler type attachments
exist, can gain better self-awareness tend show
romantic attachments, thereby navigate healthier mate seeking, healthier


breakups, case dictates it, cases healthy long-term relationships
understanding person can either similar complimentary us. One
neither better other. simply case romantic attachments,
initial inception romantic attachment, desire, love, attachment,
autonomic coordination. course coordination sorts things like
food, sex, sleep, finances, people going live, many
features, core seeking either autonomic likeness
autonomic differences. think recognition can extremely valuable thinking
tools enter maintain relationships. one thinks autonomic
nervous system, not simply something driven external people events,
can actually gain control techniques sort
talked earlier previous podcasts, also generally, able adjust
autonomic nervous system order least appreciate get empathy
someone else experiencing, gain actual cognitive empathy.
episode isn't empathy per se, theme keeps coming again.
think worth mentioning talk psychologists, whether not
psychoanalyst another source training, find don't
talk empathy general term, will talk emotional empathy, talk
cognitive empathy. talking today

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

01:47:43 Autonomic Coordination Relationships

play driving calling desire, love attachment. keeping
exploration fact saying, book, song, example
pretty much relationship dynamic, want now talk article came
little 10 years ago talked universality love ability
fall love. much line George Bernard Shaw quote
mentioned earlier "Love really overestimating differences
individuals." again, say not something personally believe,
although maybe just diluting myself. like think people fall love
really special us, not easily replaced anybody else.


simply stance. not basing hardcore neurobiological
mechanism. nonetheless, article published New York Times 2015
related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains
academic science. whole basis article 36 questions lead
love. involved listing indeed 36 questions, divided set one, set two,
set three progressed somewhat ordinary questions life experience
self-report more, call deep questions people's values things
emotionally close them. just give example these.
can find easily online just putting search engine, 36 questions lead
love. questions set number one, instance,
constitute perfect day you? life feel grateful? Kind
standard questionnaire stuff. set two, treasured memory?
terrible memory? these, can tell, drilling little bit deeper
one's personal experience emotional system. set three, questions 25
36 things, embarrassing moment life?
last cry front another person yourself? something serious
joked about? going deeper one's emotional system. even questions
like, people family, whose death find disturbing
why? pretty, pretty heavy stuff end. Now, reason article got
much traction, reason bringing today statement
made around article two people went date simply sat
asked questions, answered questions
paying attention carefully level emotionally responding not
responding, certainly paying attention answers person,
end exchange, one person asks 36 questions person
answers 36, person asks 36 person answers
36, fall love, right? seems like ridiculous thing. yet
case people go exercise report feeling know
person quite well feeling certain levels attachment even love desire
person were, not predicted, excuse me, not
predicted not gone process. going exchange
questions answers progressively emotional deep level? Well,
predict going inside exchange, people creating delusional


story nature exchange reflection deeper attachment.
even though people just exchanging words, not physically touching,
not, least not point running kinds questionnaire
studies. may touch afterwards know, probably cases,
not exchanging life experience immediate way. not actually going
off world things together yet. simply exchanging narrative.
know based recent studies covered podcast,
mention again, study published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal showing individuals listen narrative, heart
rates tend synchronize least follow similar pattern, even not
room listening given narrative. Whereas case, people facing
one another listening narratives other. Certainly
autonomic responses. stands reason autonomic nervous systems
synchronizing much way Cell Report study found people will
synchronize autonomic nervous systems shared, heard story another.
words, whether not hear story, watch movie, listen song,
exchange individual stories, autonomic nervous systems potential
map onto one another. not surprised people find fall
love, quotes, answering questions one another, essentially
way questions laid establish narrative. establish
personal narrative person listening closely. don't
physiological brain imaging studies support say,
reasonable interpretation causing autonomic synchronization.
want try date even actually hypothesized
useful existing couples, even already know answers
questions. doesn't surprise either. think autonomic coordination
present mating behavior, present shared experience outside
world, movies, concerts, watching one's children somebody else, et cetera.
established sharing one's narrative personal experience. don't
want seem overly reductionist. never propose sensation, perception,
action experience life boils us just bags chemicals action
chemicals, aspect nervous system. yet looking across
psychological literature development attachment, psychological literature
adult romantic attachment, makes breaks attachments,


clear me. think courses literature multiple levels, autonomic
coordination absolutely key establishment desire, love attachment.
fact, talked earlier actual conception born autonomic
coordination one sort another. again, doesn't necessarily mean autonomic
nervous systems always synchronized case two categorizations
Fisher proposed director/testosterone type nurturing follower/estrogen
type. actually coordination opposite directions individuals fall
categories led stable attachments seeking
attachments, say. nonetheless, it's, least mind, clear
autonomic coordination hallmark feature desire, hallmark feature call
love, hallmark feature call attachment. breaking
attachments failures desire, failures love, failures
attachment time line work Gottman others. even just
simply required mating behavior also reflected autonomic nervous
system. case, failure coordinate

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological
studies psychological studies really point that. instance, never say
serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way
yet. cautious assigning without evidence. However,
interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective
measures humans, meaning asking questions good ways tease
lies truths sorts studies whether not people tend find
partner others less attractive depending people feel


themselves. think interesting aspect desire, love, attachment
following reason. hear lot order form really strong
relationship, good relationship yourself, love
yourself. often hear instance exactly not looking
relationship going find one. hear stuff, right? none
really grounded studies. Again, like sight mind, absence
makes heart grow fonder. many life examples support
statements. many life examples support statements opposite.
particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal
excitement, again, hallmark features autonomic nervous system function,
pleasure, arousal excitement, give rise self-expansion, meaning self-efficacy.
self-expansion model really great people
close romantically attached can potentially make us feel, terms
say, terms do, terms way believe feel us.
doesn't necessarily involve explicit statements telling us great
are, great gestures us, actually feel feel us.
Turns strong parameter terms feel
relationship overall. Now, probably thinking, "Oh yeah, isn't
thing love languages?" Right? don't neuroscience support,


think, love languages, not super familiar this, didn't list out,
people are... autonomic nervous system, will, tends
responsive gifts, quality time, physical touch, acts kindness. think

Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others

self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall
category positive delusions. return exactly look like.
also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team

around relationships. talked various aspects relationships
interactions people predict either staying together breaking up. much
established method can look video interactions
couples high degree certainty predict whether not
couples will stay together break time. identified call
four horsemen relationships. things essentially, almost always predict
couple will break up. think current number Gottman can
predict divorce 94% accuracy, think pretty remarkable.
even though purely psychological studies, not aware analysis
underlying physiology, things can observe couples
can lead predict whether not couple will stay together break


94% accuracy. things? four behaviors, call Four

powerful predictor breaking up. Criticism, course, not mean no
place criticism stable relationships. course, is.
frequent intensely criticism voiced. Defensiveness, course,
defensiveness. know lack ability hear another adopt stance.
lack empathy, think one way interpret defensiveness. Stonewalling,
actually another form lack empathy. turning off neural circuit
critical desire, love attachment. stonewalling essentially means
emotional response request another completely cut off. it's, don't think
brain imaging this, think, can reasonably imagine involves
untethering insular response dealing with,

want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory
setting. idea sex drive way forage potential love partners
love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not
neurochemical hormone systems tuned toward particular types behaviors.
mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men
testosterone estrogen, testosterone
women, less estrogen women. Typically women estrogen
testosterone, again, averages. less testosterone men,
estrogen men, forth. hormone systems active
sets individuals. course, humans, far know, manufacture
dopamine serotonin. Dopamine, mentioned earlier, number effects
brain body. one primary effects places us states
motivation pursuit various things. somewhat close relationship
dopamine system testosterone system hypothalamus, brain area
roof mouth. pituitary gland, responsible making
hormones make ovaries testes, secrete testosterone estrogen.
lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

simply stance. not basing hardcore neurobiological

related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains
academic science. whole basis article 36 questions lead

emotionally close them. just give example these.
can find easily online just putting search engine, 36 questions lead

36 things, embarrassing moment life?

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological
studies psychological studies really point that. instance, never say
serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way
yet. cautious assigning without evidence. However,
interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective
measures humans, meaning asking questions good ways tease
lies truths sorts studies whether not people tend find

particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal

self-expansion model really great people

say, terms do, terms way believe feel us.
doesn't necessarily involve explicit statements telling us great

Turns strong parameter terms feel

calling empathy, really autonomic matching. again,
insula prefrontal cortex neural circuits crucial autonomic

01:10:02 Positive Delusion, Touch

allow us say, there, want match not?
Okay? third category neural circuit Helen Fisher others
found important desire, love attachment neural circuit associated
self-delusion. mean that? Well, first all, self-delusion implies kind
cynicism love attachment. think George Bernard Shaw said,
"Love really overestimating differences individuals." Actually,
hear that, say it, really don't like quote. no bone pick
George Bernard Shaw, suggests think meant that, love
attachment, tend put much value forget many
processes going brain body actually evoked many
people too. think somewhat overlooks enormous power attachment
ways somebody's smell, somebody's voice, somebody's everything,


somebody's particular thing things can really become vital autonomic
nervous system feel soothed feel elated, et cetera. think
quote accurate, one sense, think overlook neural circuits
attachment just deeply wired can become us. will balance

find really point incredible person one tends
attached really one several people ever exist
evoke feelings us. course can read Neruda poetry,
can find things place, music, poetry, writing. every
cynical quote neural circuits generic activated
anybody, think find ample number opposing quotes neural
circuits can activated special someone, particular person,
maybe just small set people. delusion? Well, work Helen
Fisher others really pointed fact desire, love attachment
three separate phases call romantic relationships. typically, not always,
typically desire tends come first falls early phase. process
romantic/sexual interactions, doesn't necessarily sex itself, certainly
something involves intimacy kind, right? generally touch kind,
eventually transitions call love, eventually transitions
call attachment. just mention touch touch fundamental aspect
whole process. article, research article, say, title is,
"Relationship-specific Encoding Social Touch Somatosensory Insular Cortices."
Cortices cortex. Cortex's plural, cortices. again, friend insula.
study explored brain areas body areas activated
specific forms attachment social touch. found not surprisingly
areas brain associated touch, somatosensory areas,
interestingly, insular cortex strongly activated touch. touch
amount touching, proximity, skin contact, not surprisingly activates brain
areas associated somatosensory, touch, also insular cortex, again,
brain area links internal feelings going inside us
surface skin events external. found activation number
brain areas, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, on. not
essential just understanding insular place start take
experience internal landscape, attach perceptions external


landscape, assign value assign sort interpretation.
positive delusion predictive long-term attachment. mean positive
delusion? Positive delusion contradiction George Bernard Shaw quote.
belief person can make feel way. person holds
capacity make feel way physically emotionally both. so, move
desire love attachment, brain circuitry literally getting tuned
individual happen attached to, again, thinking
monogamous relationships, guess non-monogamous relationship individuals
way autonomic nervous system can regulated. actually
get access control panel.

01:15:20 Relationship Stability

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,
find key features interactions individuals
predict relationship will last. many, mainly fall
category positive delusions. return exactly look like.
also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team
University Washington Seattle. Gottman's have, run laboratory
department psychology long time. also done lot public facing work
around relationships. talked various aspects relationships
interactions people predict either staying together breaking up. much
established method can look video interactions
couples high degree certainty predict whether not
couples will stay together break time. identified call
four horsemen relationships. things essentially, almost always predict
couple will break up. think current number Gottman can
predict divorce 94% accuracy, think pretty remarkable.
even though purely psychological studies, not aware analysis
underlying physiology, things can observe couples
can lead predict whether not couple will stay together break


94% accuracy. things? four behaviors, call Four
Horsemen Apocalypse [laughs] relationships one, criticism, two,
defensiveness, three, stonewalling, four, contempt, contempt
powerful predictor breaking up. Criticism, course, not mean no
place criticism stable relationships. course, is.
frequent intensely criticism voiced. Defensiveness, course,
defensiveness. know lack ability hear another adopt stance.
lack empathy, think one way interpret defensiveness. Stonewalling,
actually another form lack empathy. turning off neural circuit
critical desire, love attachment. stonewalling essentially means
emotional response request another completely cut off. it's, don't think
brain imaging this, think, can reasonably imagine involves
untethering insular response dealing with,
focusing insular response, [giggles] no pun intended, internal state
perhaps state someone else entirely. talk infidelity moment.
contempt. contempt actually referred sulfuric acid relationship.
didn't say that, Gottman colleagues have. powerful predictor
divorce breakups future. contempt, course, definition feeling
person thing beneath consideration, worthlessness deserving scorn.
apparently can identify videos couples discussions
interacting elaborate eye rolls, expressions anger one individual
partner actually expressing enthusiasm excitement something. the,
oh yeah, say that, deep seated resentment toward other, much
apparent one actively dislikes partner. contempt, disregard
something taken account way think it. runs
counter neural circuits, three neural circuits talked
before. certainly, antithesis empathy. anything positive delusion.
really looking individual, either accurately inaccurately somebody
despise. absolute inversion autonomic seesaw matching
talking before. dissociating seesaw seesaw.
excited something, unexcited it. fact, inversion
seesaw excited, down. down, up, okay?
basically inversion neural circuits Helen Fisher others
identified critical desire, love, attachment. therefore not surprising


strongly predictive breakups, case married couples, divorce.
interested work Gottman's similar work,
written several popular books. fairly easy find. can link one
caption. also developed quite interesting online resources
so-called Love Lab. guess fortunate didn't call Hate Lab
Breakup Lab, 'cause focused lot predicts breakups. also
written extensively researched extensively peer-reviewed studies makes
people find appropriate partners them, maintain partnerships time.
can go, can search Love Lab, University Washington, Gottman,

01:21:22 Selecting Mates, Recognition Autonomic Tone

number various books. think find useful resources there.
want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory
setting. idea sex drive way forage potential love partners
love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not
neurochemical hormone systems tuned toward particular types behaviors.
mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men
testosterone estrogen, testosterone
women, less estrogen women. Typically women estrogen
testosterone, again, averages. less testosterone men,
estrogen men, forth. hormone systems active
sets individuals. course, humans, far know, manufacture
dopamine serotonin. Dopamine, mentioned earlier, number effects
brain body. one primary effects places us states
motivation pursuit various things. somewhat close relationship
dopamine system testosterone system hypothalamus, brain area
roof mouth. pituitary gland, responsible making
hormones make ovaries testes, secrete testosterone estrogen.
lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might
relationship financial stability isn't quite there, basic
stability isn't there. imagine, instance, situation relationship
two people called high serotonin preference
relationship actually dull, found bored
point, wasn't enough dynamic tension sometimes
required order keep cycle desire, love, attachment going. Something
will talk moment. point not one necessarily pair
according arrangements described. point average,
tends happen. recognition categorizations exist
similar recognition type A, B, C, D infant toddler type attachments
exist, can gain better self-awareness tend show
romantic attachments, thereby navigate healthier mate seeking, healthier


breakups, case dictates it, cases healthy long-term relationships
understanding person can either similar complimentary us. One
neither better other. simply case romantic attachments,
initial inception romantic attachment, desire, love, attachment,
autonomic coordination. course coordination sorts things like
food, sex, sleep, finances, people going live, many
features, core seeking either autonomic likeness
autonomic differences. think recognition can extremely valuable thinking
tools enter maintain relationships. one thinks autonomic
nervous system, not simply something driven external people events,
can actually gain control techniques sort
talked earlier previous podcasts, also generally, able adjust
autonomic nervous system order least appreciate get empathy
someone else experiencing, gain actual cognitive empathy.
episode isn't empathy per se, theme keeps coming again.
think worth mentioning talk psychologists, whether not
psychoanalyst another source training, find don't
talk empathy general term, will talk emotional empathy, talk
cognitive empathy. talking today

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

01:47:43 Autonomic Coordination Relationships

play driving calling desire, love attachment. keeping
exploration fact saying, book, song, example
pretty much relationship dynamic, want now talk article came
little 10 years ago talked universality love ability
fall love. much line George Bernard Shaw quote
mentioned earlier "Love really overestimating differences
individuals." again, say not something personally believe,
although maybe just diluting myself. like think people fall love
really special us, not easily replaced anybody else.


simply stance. not basing hardcore neurobiological
mechanism. nonetheless, article published New York Times 2015
related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains
academic science. whole basis article 36 questions lead
love. involved listing indeed 36 questions, divided set one, set two,
set three progressed somewhat ordinary questions life experience
self-report more, call deep questions people's values things
emotionally close them. just give example these.
can find easily online just putting search engine, 36 questions lead
love. questions set number one, instance,
constitute perfect day you? life feel grateful? Kind
standard questionnaire stuff. set two, treasured memory?
terrible memory? these, can tell, drilling little bit deeper
one's personal experience emotional system. set three, questions 25
36 things, embarrassing moment life?
last cry front another person yourself? something serious
joked about? going deeper one's emotional system. even questions
like, people family, whose death find disturbing
why? pretty, pretty heavy stuff end. Now, reason article got
much traction, reason bringing today statement

asked questions, answered questions
paying attention carefully level emotionally responding not

case people go exercise report feeling know
person quite well feeling certain levels attachment even love desire
person were, not predicted, excuse me, not

predict going inside exchange, people creating delusional


story nature exchange reflection deeper attachment.
even though people just exchanging words, not physically touching,
not, least not point running kinds questionnaire
studies. may touch afterwards know, probably cases,
not exchanging life experience immediate way. not actually going
off world things together yet. simply exchanging narrative.
know based recent studies covered podcast,
mention again, study published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal showing individuals listen narrative, heart

psychological literature development attachment, psychological literature
adult romantic attachment, makes breaks attachments,


clear me. think courses literature multiple levels, autonomic

fact, talked earlier actual conception born autonomic
coordination one sort another. again, doesn't necessarily mean autonomic

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological
studies psychological studies really point that. instance, never say
serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way
yet. cautious assigning without evidence. However,
interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective
measures humans, meaning asking questions good ways tease
lies truths sorts studies whether not people tend find
partner others less attractive depending people feel


themselves. think interesting aspect desire, love, attachment
following reason. hear lot order form really strong
relationship, good relationship yourself, love
yourself. often hear instance exactly not looking
relationship going find one. hear stuff, right? none
really grounded studies. Again, like sight mind, absence
makes heart grow fonder. many life examples support
statements. many life examples support statements opposite.
particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal

self-expansion model really great people

Turns strong parameter terms feel

autonomic nervous system empathy positive delusion. Now positive
delusion critical. look stability relationships time, something
extensively studied mainly psychologists, now also neurobiologists,

also just handful things predict relationship will fail time.
largely work Gottman's, actually husband wife team

want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory
setting. idea sex drive way forage potential love partners
love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not
neurochemical hormone systems tuned toward particular types behaviors.
mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men
testosterone estrogen, testosterone
women, less estrogen women. Typically women estrogen
testosterone, again, averages. less testosterone men,
estrogen men, forth. hormone systems active
sets individuals. course, humans, far know, manufacture
dopamine serotonin. Dopamine, mentioned earlier, number effects
brain body. one primary effects places us states
motivation pursuit various things. somewhat close relationship
dopamine system testosterone system hypothalamus, brain area
roof mouth. pituitary gland, responsible making
hormones make ovaries testes, secrete testosterone estrogen.
lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might
relationship financial stability isn't quite there, basic
stability isn't there. imagine, instance, situation relationship
two people called high serotonin preference
relationship actually dull, found bored
point, wasn't enough dynamic tension sometimes
required order keep cycle desire, love, attachment going. Something
will talk moment. point not one necessarily pair
according arrangements described. point average,
tends happen. recognition categorizations exist
similar recognition type A, B, C, D infant toddler type attachments
exist, can gain better self-awareness tend show
romantic attachments, thereby navigate healthier mate seeking, healthier


breakups, case dictates it, cases healthy long-term relationships
understanding person can either similar complimentary us. One
neither better other. simply case romantic attachments,
initial inception romantic attachment, desire, love, attachment,
autonomic coordination. course coordination sorts things like
food, sex, sleep, finances, people going live, many
features, core seeking either autonomic likeness
autonomic differences. think recognition can extremely valuable thinking
tools enter maintain relationships. one thinks autonomic
nervous system, not simply something driven external people events,
can actually gain control techniques sort
talked earlier previous podcasts, also generally, able adjust
autonomic nervous system order least appreciate get empathy
someone else experiencing, gain actual cognitive empathy.
episode isn't empathy per se, theme keeps coming again.
think worth mentioning talk psychologists, whether not
psychoanalyst another source training, find don't
talk empathy general term, will talk emotional empathy, talk
cognitive empathy. talking today

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological
studies psychological studies really point that. instance, never say
serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way

interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective

particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not

turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal

self-expansion model really great people

doesn't necessarily involve explicit statements telling us great

Turns strong parameter terms feel

meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,

aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing

average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort

neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new

again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes

people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain

just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,

studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization

go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default

kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate

nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

subjects. subjects experienced loss libido took Tribulus
divided two equal doses, compared placebo. see significant
improvement measures sexual desire function female sexual
function index. evidence Tribulus can effective increasing
testosterone certain populations, increasing sexual desire function certain
populations particular females. think studies certainly needed.
three substances/supplements, Maca, Tongkat Ali, particular, Indonesian Tongkat Ali,
Tribulus can indeed create significant increases sexual desire. cases
adjusting testosterone estrogen system, cases not adjusting
testosterone estrogen system. Again, pointing complexity neurochemicals
features adjust things like libido aka desire. covered lot material

number various books. think find useful resources there.
want shift back work Helen Fisher. made interesting
statements interesting observations least mind map
well onto knowledge neural circuitry humans non-human primates
species. realize name game. made
observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions
individuals dating sites. going share moment.
that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love
partners arc whole business really order describing it,
desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least
period time. think interesting framework circumvents lot the,
frankly, unanswerable questions whether not humans meant


monogamous whether not weren't. conversations hold cultural
context, hold sorts context, really can't addressed laboratory
setting. idea sex drive way forage potential love partners
love litmus test whether not longer term deeper attachments can will
form, one least makes sense me. Later episode, talk
notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know
still match.com, extensive dataset. again, millions not tens
millions individuals. number heard quote, forgive not
accurate, upwards 40 million individuals, terms whether not
neurochemical hormone systems tuned toward particular types behaviors.
mean that? Well, men women, males females
testosterone estrogen. Typically, again, averages, typically men
testosterone estrogen, testosterone
women, less estrogen women. Typically women estrogen
testosterone, again, averages. less testosterone men,
estrogen men, forth. hormone systems active
sets individuals. course, humans, far know, manufacture
dopamine serotonin. Dopamine, mentioned earlier, number effects
brain body. one primary effects places us states
motivation pursuit various things. somewhat close relationship
dopamine system testosterone system hypothalamus, brain area
roof mouth. pituitary gland, responsible making
hormones make ovaries testes, secrete testosterone estrogen.
lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might
relationship financial stability isn't quite there, basic
stability isn't there. imagine, instance, situation relationship
two people called high serotonin preference
relationship actually dull, found bored
point, wasn't enough dynamic tension sometimes
required order keep cycle desire, love, attachment going. Something
will talk moment. point not one necessarily pair
according arrangements described. point average,
tends happen. recognition categorizations exist
similar recognition type A, B, C, D infant toddler type attachments
exist, can gain better self-awareness tend show
romantic attachments, thereby navigate healthier mate seeking, healthier


breakups, case dictates it, cases healthy long-term relationships
understanding person can either similar complimentary us. One
neither better other. simply case romantic attachments,
initial inception romantic attachment, desire, love, attachment,
autonomic coordination. course coordination sorts things like
food, sex, sleep, finances, people going live, many
features, core seeking either autonomic likeness
autonomic differences. think recognition can extremely valuable thinking
tools enter maintain relationships. one thinks autonomic
nervous system, not simply something driven external people events,
can actually gain control techniques sort
talked earlier previous podcasts, also generally, able adjust
autonomic nervous system order least appreciate get empathy
someone else experiencing, gain actual cognitive empathy.
episode isn't empathy per se, theme keeps coming again.
think worth mentioning talk psychologists, whether not
psychoanalyst another source training, find don't
talk empathy general term, will talk emotional empathy, talk
cognitive empathy. talking today

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

01:47:43 Autonomic Coordination Relationships

play driving calling desire, love attachment. keeping
exploration fact saying, book, song, example
pretty much relationship dynamic, want now talk article came
little 10 years ago talked universality love ability
fall love. much line George Bernard Shaw quote
mentioned earlier "Love really overestimating differences
individuals." again, say not something personally believe,
although maybe just diluting myself. like think people fall love
really special us, not easily replaced anybody else.


simply stance. not basing hardcore neurobiological
mechanism. nonetheless, article published New York Times 2015
related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains
academic science. whole basis article 36 questions lead
love. involved listing indeed 36 questions, divided set one, set two,
set three progressed somewhat ordinary questions life experience
self-report more, call deep questions people's values things
emotionally close them. just give example these.
can find easily online just putting search engine, 36 questions lead
love. questions set number one, instance,
constitute perfect day you? life feel grateful? Kind
standard questionnaire stuff. set two, treasured memory?
terrible memory? these, can tell, drilling little bit deeper
one's personal experience emotional system. set three, questions 25
36 things, embarrassing moment life?
last cry front another person yourself? something serious
joked about? going deeper one's emotional system. even questions
like, people family, whose death find disturbing
why? pretty, pretty heavy stuff end. Now, reason article got
much traction, reason bringing today statement
made around article two people went date simply sat
asked questions, answered questions
paying attention carefully level emotionally responding not
responding, certainly paying attention answers person,
end exchange, one person asks 36 questions person
answers 36, person asks 36 person answers
36, fall love, right? seems like ridiculous thing. yet
case people go exercise report feeling know
person quite well feeling certain levels attachment even love desire
person were, not predicted, excuse me, not
predicted not gone process. going exchange
questions answers progressively emotional deep level? Well,
predict going inside exchange, people creating delusional


story nature exchange reflection deeper attachment.
even though people just exchanging words, not physically touching,
not, least not point running kinds questionnaire
studies. may touch afterwards know, probably cases,
not exchanging life experience immediate way. not actually going
off world things together yet. simply exchanging narrative.
know based recent studies covered podcast,
mention again, study published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal showing individuals listen narrative, heart
rates tend synchronize least follow similar pattern, even not
room listening given narrative. Whereas case, people facing
one another listening narratives other. Certainly
autonomic responses. stands reason autonomic nervous systems
synchronizing much way Cell Report study found people will
synchronize autonomic nervous systems shared, heard story another.
words, whether not hear story, watch movie, listen song,
exchange individual stories, autonomic nervous systems potential
map onto one another. not surprised people find fall
love, quotes, answering questions one another, essentially
way questions laid establish narrative. establish
personal narrative person listening closely. don't
physiological brain imaging studies support say,
reasonable interpretation causing autonomic synchronization.
want try date even actually hypothesized
useful existing couples, even already know answers
questions. doesn't surprise either. think autonomic coordination
present mating behavior, present shared experience outside
world, movies, concerts, watching one's children somebody else, et cetera.
established sharing one's narrative personal experience. don't
want seem overly reductionist. never propose sensation, perception,
action experience life boils us just bags chemicals action
chemicals, aspect nervous system. yet looking across
psychological literature development attachment, psychological literature
adult romantic attachment, makes breaks attachments,


clear me. think courses literature multiple levels, autonomic
coordination absolutely key establishment desire, love attachment.
fact, talked earlier actual conception born autonomic
coordination one sort another. again, doesn't necessarily mean autonomic
nervous systems always synchronized case two categorizations
Fisher proposed director/testosterone type nurturing follower/estrogen
type. actually coordination opposite directions individuals fall
categories led stable attachments seeking
attachments, say. nonetheless, it's, least mind, clear
autonomic coordination hallmark feature desire, hallmark feature call
love, hallmark feature call attachment. breaking
attachments failures desire, failures love, failures
attachment time line work Gottman others. even just
simply required mating behavior also reflected autonomic nervous
system. case, failure coordinate

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological
studies psychological studies really point that. instance, never say
serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way
yet. cautious assigning without evidence. However,
interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective
measures humans, meaning asking questions good ways tease
lies truths sorts studies whether not people tend find
partner others less attractive depending people feel


themselves. think interesting aspect desire, love, attachment
following reason. hear lot order form really strong
relationship, good relationship yourself, love
yourself. often hear instance exactly not looking
relationship going find one. hear stuff, right? none
really grounded studies. Again, like sight mind, absence
makes heart grow fonder. many life examples support
statements. many life examples support statements opposite.
particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal
excitement, again, hallmark features autonomic nervous system function,
pleasure, arousal excitement, give rise self-expansion, meaning self-efficacy.
self-expansion model really great people
close romantically attached can potentially make us feel, terms
say, terms do, terms way believe feel us.
doesn't necessarily involve explicit statements telling us great
are, great gestures us, actually feel feel us.
Turns strong parameter terms feel
relationship overall. Now, probably thinking, "Oh yeah, isn't
thing love languages?" Right? don't neuroscience support,


think, love languages, not super familiar this, didn't list out,
people are... autonomic nervous system, will, tends
responsive gifts, quality time, physical touch, acts kindness. think

interesting me, may means actual perception others

Again, attractive alternative partners, literally language title paper,

set attractive faces appear less attractive given individual. Now, whether not

assess neuroimaging. there, course, people rarely ever report accurately
cheating behavior. studies confidentiality assured

look statistics cheating behavior, hard track people

observations think very, say, parsimonious, meaning allow us
organize lot stuff distinct frameworks. Now, also done
really beautiful studies involve data millions even tens millions

that, just want paraphrase Dr. Fisher, said sex drive desire
pursuit someone mate with, meaning mate, verb, not necessarily find
mate, may be, didn't say definitively, may way forage potential love

desire, love, attachment. oftentimes people can get
confused. may know people, may one individuals
might confuse desire attachment might confuse love attachment,
sequence recruitment neural circuits established first
pursuit someone mate with. placed us context modern
dating themes depending culture, people might explore several, maybe many,
many individuals before, quote, unquote, settling somebody, least

notion sex drive desire. actually talk tools strong
data really support terms things people can take increase
libido, men women, actually quite good data now.
meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know

tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within
category. Again, averages. Individuals placed serotonin group
hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair
select date, presume mate form stable relationships people
category. Now, individuals two categories, high testosterone group,
again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

01:47:43 Autonomic Coordination Relationships

play driving calling desire, love attachment. keeping
exploration fact saying, book, song, example
pretty much relationship dynamic, want now talk article came

simply stance. not basing hardcore neurobiological

related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains
academic science. whole basis article 36 questions lead

set three progressed somewhat ordinary questions life experience
self-report more, call deep questions people's values things
emotionally close them. just give example these.
can find easily online just putting search engine, 36 questions lead

36 things, embarrassing moment life?
last cry front another person yourself? something serious
joked about? going deeper one's emotional system. even questions
like, people family, whose death find disturbing

clear me. think courses literature multiple levels, autonomic

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological
studies psychological studies really point that. instance, never say
serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way
yet. cautious assigning without evidence. However,
interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective
measures humans, meaning asking questions good ways tease
lies truths sorts studies whether not people tend find
partner others less attractive depending people feel


themselves. think interesting aspect desire, love, attachment
following reason. hear lot order form really strong

data really support terms things people can take increase

meantime, want talk work Dr. Fisher done terms
categorizing people into... Again, four groups. distinct A,
B, C, D attachment styles described earlier. Although describe them, might
able map somewhat onto those. four groups groups
defined studies people were, are, don't know

lot signaling occurs dopamine testosterone tend
operate close cousins system pursuit. conversely, serotonin system
tends average collaborate estrogen system impart certain physiological
functions behaviors. aren't hard fast, guess better stated,


aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing
interactions. Conversely, group Dr. Fisher calls serotonin group tend
grounded soothing activities, quiescent type activities. actually tend be,
average, tend like rules follow rules, tend homebodies, sort
thing. really, can imagine stable types, really like
stability. not really spontaneity much, again, averages.
created two categories, testosterone category high testosterone. again,
males females. estrogen category, again, males
females. gave different names won't go here. can look
work online, names like director, follower, things like that.
don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different
groups individuals absolutely can categorize based self-reported
preferences behaviors certain kinds interactions. groups tend


pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.
people spontaneously take trip explore something new
new restaurant. tend creative explorative types. group
average tends date mate, potentially form long-term relationships within

hypothesized high serotonin group, again, didn't measure serotonin,
people tend place value stability, rules, certain forms traditional
organization home relationships, people also tended pair

again, testosterone wasn't measured, called high testosterone group,
people tend directive, tend know want
comfortable telling people want. them,
individuals studies studies tend little bit challenging,
meaning not necessarily challenging around, tend challenge
people, push order expand boundaries, either sake relationship
just general. people tend push people pair with,
people estrogen category, called high estrogen. Again,
didn't measure estrogen, people estrogen category ones
described choices life preferences nurturing.
actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not
every decision. certainly like heard, course, terms preferences.
two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not
names, molecules not measured individuals,
bring us themes addressed before,
autonomic nervous system whether not tends shifted towards
alertness action towards stable equilibrium towards calm,
whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems
less like even meet, right? again, going back


seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation
seeking, novelty seeking, seem want pair one another.
selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone
estrogen, on. important recognition respect
types, recognition respect fact type.
actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,
novelty seeking terrifically exciting relationship, actually might
relationship financial stability isn't quite there, basic
stability isn't there. imagine, instance, situation relationship
two people called high serotonin preference

can actually gain control techniques sort
talked earlier previous podcasts, also generally, able adjust

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,
actually jaw flicked like this. one things. not lot
moving around heard, least not using current technology. case,
found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization
individuals. Now, simple version looking way would've thought
go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

exploration fact saying, book, song, example
pretty much relationship dynamic, want now talk article came
little 10 years ago talked universality love ability
fall love. much line George Bernard Shaw quote
mentioned earlier "Love really overestimating differences
individuals." again, say not something personally believe,
although maybe just diluting myself. like think people fall love
really special us, not easily replaced anybody else.


simply stance. not basing hardcore neurobiological
mechanism. nonetheless, article published New York Times 2015
related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains
academic science. whole basis article 36 questions lead
love. involved listing indeed 36 questions, divided set one, set two,
set three progressed somewhat ordinary questions life experience
self-report more, call deep questions people's values things
emotionally close them. just give example these.
can find easily online just putting search engine, 36 questions lead
love. questions set number one, instance,
constitute perfect day you? life feel grateful? Kind
standard questionnaire stuff. set two, treasured memory?
terrible memory? these, can tell, drilling little bit deeper
one's personal experience emotional system. set three, questions 25
36 things, embarrassing moment life?
last cry front another person yourself? something serious
joked about? going deeper one's emotional system. even questions
like, people family, whose death find disturbing
why? pretty, pretty heavy stuff end. Now, reason article got
much traction, reason bringing today statement
made around article two people went date simply sat
asked questions, answered questions
paying attention carefully level emotionally responding not
responding, certainly paying attention answers person,
end exchange, one person asks 36 questions person
answers 36, person asks 36 person answers
36, fall love, right? seems like ridiculous thing. yet
case people go exercise report feeling know
person quite well feeling certain levels attachment even love desire
person were, not predicted, excuse me, not
predicted not gone process. going exchange
questions answers progressively emotional deep level? Well,
predict going inside exchange, people creating delusional


story nature exchange reflection deeper attachment.
even though people just exchanging words, not physically touching,
not, least not point running kinds questionnaire
studies. may touch afterwards know, probably cases,

aren't strict black white categorizations, think general themes hold
look animal human data. Dr. Fisher taken liberties,
think call logically, scientifically, neurobiologically
grounded liberties classifying individuals dating sites according
types things report type people tend
match dating sites, created four categories. four categories
are, calls one, dopamine category. people high
dopamine. again, just name. doesn't mean low anything else,
high dopamine scale. People rate high dopamine scale
tend scientists psychologists call high sensation seeking, novel
seeking. like new things, like spontaneity, tend adventurous.
think largely true. look conditions dopamine super
physiological, elevated beyond abnormal levels. Things like mania people
take certain drugs abuse, like cocaine amphetamine really raise dopamine
levels very, high. period time, tend increase energy
motivation novelty seeking. course, drugs like amphetamine cocaine
sorts deleterious effects don't need go here, worth
pointing out. don't tend make people calm relaxed seek soothing

don't really want use much want stick biological terms.
dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, estrogen. Now might seem like
unfair overgeneralization, interesting not necessarily name
neurochemical system, right? just called category one, two,
three four matters here. interesting seeing different

pair people opposite categories. studies reveal
people fall high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, spontaneity category,
one calls high dopamine category tend pair with, least
short term, tend pair people also dopaminergic category.

actually seem like someone else making major decisions, not

two types, called testosterone estrogen type tend
pair up. categorizations averages interesting me, least
interesting enough convey you? reason interesting is, again, not

whether not individuals selecting people autonomic nervous systems

seesaw analogy, almost like people flat seesaw, alert calm,
not extremely alert, not extremely overly calm situations middle, seem
seeking people also autonomic equilibrium. People the,
called dopamine category, really can just described high sensation

selection similar, two groups, autonomic tone. find interesting
decision preference similar autonomic tone, essentially
eliminates lot requirement figuring match one's autonomic
nervous system another. simply find someone similar tendency, okay?
Whereas two groups called testosterone estrogen, director
type nurturing somewhat follower type, establishment balance,
not two individuals match, rather whole
relationship. One person driving novelty seeking course decisions
actions, person essentially agreeing those. Now, assuming
decisions good people. emphasize good people, one
themes Dr. Fisher underscores, like underscore well,
need not case people pair exactly according categorizations
described, dopamine dopamine, serotonin serotonin, testosterone

actually imagine, instance, two people high sensation seeking,

01:38:28 Neural Mechanisms Romantic Attachment

yet third category strongly determinant relationship dynamics,
autonomic empathy. biologist, not psychologist. love mechanism.
fortunately studies done recently using modern techniques
look neural mechanisms romantic attachment. mentioned earlier brain
imaging studies done child mother literally imaging activity
neurons brain child nursing, mother soothing baby,
learned earlier, baby soothing mother well. remarkable studies. may
seen pictures online. can see silhouette infant
mother, brains even brain activation patterns, really, really
beautiful studies. Similar studies done romantic couples
couples, either touching one another, touching kissing, clever, think, control
experiments person just touching pillow, [laughs] something, kissing


pillow order try create reasonable control actually pretty
complicated interpersonal dynamics brain imaging scanner.
studies done recently involved called EEG.
electrical recordings done noninvasively, putting bunch electrodes
outside scalp. EEG useful can noninvasively, can
people moving things, kissing, touching, et cetera. doesn't allow one
image evaluate neural activity deeply brain. can miss lot
things. like looking wave structure ocean without actually looking
depths ocean. can miss certain things, see things generally
trust there, can't see don't see. Nonetheless,
studies just point form segue going discuss
moment, study published Scientific Reports 2021, entitled "Investigating
Real Life Emotions Romantic Couples: Mobile EEG Study." is, title
suggests, people wear EEG caps electrodes, get engage
passionate, emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another standing different
distances. lot cool stuff can really couldn't brain
scanner, brain scanner, people usually bite bar,

found shift brain waves, brain states, things like alpha waves
just particular frequency brain waves neocortex, outer shell brain
just beneath skull. people kissing people engaged
romantic speech, didn't actually hear said one another,
couple seems exciting, romantic arousing them, see alpha wave
activity compared control conditions. call
lateralization, left hemisphere active right forth.
studies important know autonomic nervous systems
individuals tend start collaborate actually synchronize level heartbeats,
level breathing romantic interactions different kinds. studies
first kind start looking neural synchronization

go was, okay, two people start kissing, start talking find
particularly romantic arousing them. brain waves will just match one
another. really basis romantic attachment romantic engagement


sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:

Now study little bit different. looked resting default

kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can

EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek

Aron Aron. last name. assuming either

sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:

space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.

not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat

serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,

particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal

sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.

Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair

related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains

infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others

serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,

interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective

particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal

self-expansion model really great people

Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default

kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.

Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair

simply stance. not basing hardcore neurobiological
mechanism. nonetheless, article published New York Times 2015
related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains
academic science. whole basis article 36 questions lead
love. involved listing indeed 36 questions, divided set one, set two,
set three progressed somewhat ordinary questions life experience
self-report more, call deep questions people's values things
emotionally close them. just give example these.
can find easily online just putting search engine, 36 questions lead
love. questions set number one, instance,
constitute perfect day you? life feel grateful? Kind
standard questionnaire stuff. set two, treasured memory?
terrible memory? these, can tell, drilling little bit deeper
one's personal experience emotional system. set three, questions 25
36 things, embarrassing moment life?
last cry front another person yourself? something serious
joked about? going deeper one's emotional system. even questions
like, people family, whose death find disturbing

clear me. think courses literature multiple levels, autonomic

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological
studies psychological studies really point that. instance, never say
serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way

interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective

particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal

remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,

exploration fact saying, book, song, example
pretty much relationship dynamic, want now talk article came
little 10 years ago talked universality love ability
fall love. much line George Bernard Shaw quote
mentioned earlier "Love really overestimating differences
individuals." again, say not something personally believe,
although maybe just diluting myself. like think people fall love
really special us, not easily replaced anybody else.


simply stance. not basing hardcore neurobiological
mechanism. nonetheless, article published New York Times 2015
related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains
academic science. whole basis article 36 questions lead
love. involved listing indeed 36 questions, divided set one, set two,
set three progressed somewhat ordinary questions life experience
self-report more, call deep questions people's values things
emotionally close them. just give example these.
can find easily online just putting search engine, 36 questions lead
love. questions set number one, instance,
constitute perfect day you? life feel grateful? Kind
standard questionnaire stuff. set two, treasured memory?
terrible memory? these, can tell, drilling little bit deeper
one's personal experience emotional system. set three, questions 25
36 things, embarrassing moment life?
last cry front another person yourself? something serious
joked about? going deeper one's emotional system. even questions
like, people family, whose death find disturbing
why? pretty, pretty heavy stuff end. Now, reason article got
much traction, reason bringing today statement
made around article two people went date simply sat
asked questions, answered questions
paying attention carefully level emotionally responding not

end exchange, one person asks 36 questions person

36, fall love, right? seems like ridiculous thing. yet
case people go exercise report feeling know
person quite well feeling certain levels attachment even love desire
person were, not predicted, excuse me, not
predicted not gone process. going exchange
questions answers progressively emotional deep level? Well,
predict going inside exchange, people creating delusional


story nature exchange reflection deeper attachment.
even though people just exchanging words, not physically touching,
not, least not point running kinds questionnaire
studies. may touch afterwards know, probably cases,
not exchanging life experience immediate way. not actually going
off world things together yet. simply exchanging narrative.
know based recent studies covered podcast,
mention again, study published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal showing individuals listen narrative, heart
rates tend synchronize least follow similar pattern, even not
room listening given narrative. Whereas case, people facing

want seem overly reductionist. never propose sensation, perception,
action experience life boils us just bags chemicals action
chemicals, aspect nervous system. yet looking across
psychological literature development attachment, psychological literature
adult romantic attachment, makes breaks attachments,


clear me. think courses literature multiple levels, autonomic
coordination absolutely key establishment desire, love attachment.
fact, talked earlier actual conception born autonomic
coordination one sort another. again, doesn't necessarily mean autonomic
nervous systems always synchronized case two categorizations
Fisher proposed director/testosterone type nurturing follower/estrogen

categories led stable attachments seeking

01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating

autonomic nervous systems sort concerted way. discussion
desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological
studies psychological studies really point that. instance, never say
serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way
yet. cautious assigning without evidence. However,
interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective
measures humans, meaning asking questions good ways tease
lies truths sorts studies whether not people tend find
partner others less attractive depending people feel


themselves. think interesting aspect desire, love, attachment
following reason. hear lot order form really strong

really grounded studies. Again, like sight mind, absence
makes heart grow fonder. many life examples support
statements. many life examples support statements opposite.
particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal

pleasure, arousal excitement, give rise self-expansion, meaning self-efficacy.
self-expansion model really great people

say, terms do, terms way believe feel us.
doesn't necessarily involve explicit statements telling us great

Turns strong parameter terms feel

think, love languages, not super familiar this, didn't list out,

Again, attractive alternative partners, literally language title paper,

sort thing. turns opposite true. really nice study
published really fine journal, Cerebral Cortex journal known
many years, published strong anatomy, physiology neuroimaging.
study published, first author, Kajimura, paper really points... Again,
2021. title paper is, "Brain Knows Wavelength:
Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility Female-Male Relationship."
Now study little bit different. looked resting default
mode activity brain. rather evoked activity, called, people
kissing engaged activity, neuroimaging study, not EEG,
fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, similar EEG principle,
allows look deep brain. good resolution time
space. fast events can monitored precise location events can
monitored somewhat better EEG. exceptions this.
EEGers there. EEG don't come electrodes. Just understand fMRI
gives fuller picture going on. Kajimura et al found
contrary reflexive prediction might be, people tend select people
resting brain states different theirs, sometimes found
actually opposite resting brain state. might say, "Well, doesn't
make sense. thought autonomic coordination." actually go
back Helen Fisher's categorizations dopamine types, sensation seeking
types, serotonin, stable rule following types, testosterone estrogen types,
remember two categories called testosterone estrogen type,
director follower, nurturer, guess accurate way,
director nurturer, tend pair across categories, not within category.
think really needed field knowledge hasn't happened
yet, really start map neuroanatomical neurophysiological findings of,
case, resting brain state one form one individual, tend seek
people whose resting brain state different theirs, not similar. needs
mapped onto subjective psychological categorizations Helen Fisher
indeed Gottman's others created, sort state field now.
mentioned not confuse you, contrary, illustrate not just
finding someone just like you, not just finding someone opposite
you. actually reason decided become biologist point
life, can find verbal sayings, stories, examples support just


anything. not knock field psychology, can probably tell
today's episode. great respect reverence field psychology,
especially collaboration neuroscience vice versa. popular culture,
can find examples sayings support essentially anything relates
relationship. instance, heard probably heard, absence makes
heart grow fonder. indeed experienced believe true. also
experienced believe true sight mind also exists
will biological mechanism that. point matching
different can effective creating desire, love,
attachment process. matter of, looking same, looking
different? there, think Dr. Fisher work neurophysiologist brain
imagers really point direction whereby not one form attachment
going wholly [indistinct] will predict good outcomes. not going
case opposites attract, always best rule follow.
Sometimes will, sometimes won't. also not case people tend pair
similar. Sometimes will case, sometimes won't. Now certain
statistics support statement. instance, people, average, people pair
individuals similar educational background, income, attractiveness.
true average, not always case. again, knowledge respect
different categorizations attachment, different categorizations mate
seeking described Fisher others, recognition matching autonomic
nervous systems also mismatching resting state brain networks

desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat

serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,

Aron Aron. last name. assuming either

"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-

Aron Aron. last name. assuming either

O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not

turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal

Turns strong parameter terms feel

think, love languages, not super familiar this, didn't list out,

Again, attractive alternative partners, literally language title paper,

related psychological studies done, well clinical work,
well some, call pop psychology things fall outside domains
academic science. whole basis article 36 questions lead

set three progressed somewhat ordinary questions life experience
self-report more, call deep questions people's values things
emotionally close them. just give example these.
can find easily online just putting search engine, 36 questions lead

constitute perfect day you? life feel grateful? Kind
standard questionnaire stuff. set two, treasured memory?
terrible memory? these, can tell, drilling little bit deeper
one's personal experience emotional system. set three, questions 25
36 things, embarrassing moment life?
last cry front another person yourself? something serious
joked about? going deeper one's emotional system. even questions

desire, love, attachment incomplete didn't talk dreaded
infidelity cheating. Much made infidelity cheating whether
not people higher dopamine sensation seeking tend cheat
less. Frankly, don't think solid evidence that. think lot
examples can draw lives lives others
generally support one model, not aware decent physiological

serotonergic phenotype described Fisher less prone cheat,
people insecure attachment likely cheat, et cetera,
instance. don't think correlations drawn kind meaningful way
yet. cautious assigning without evidence. However,
interesting studies involving, again, neuroimaging subjective

particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."

Aron Aron. last name. assuming either

O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal

particular study found. published Frontiers Psychology,
experimental study involves neuroimaging. title study
"Manipulation Self-Expansion Alters Responses Attractive Alternative Partners."
love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal

pleasure, arousal excitement, give rise self-expansion, meaning self-efficacy.
self-expansion model really great people
close romantically attached can potentially make us feel, terms
say, terms do, terms way believe feel us.
doesn't necessarily involve explicit statements telling us great

Turns strong parameter terms feel

think, love languages, not super familiar this, didn't list out,

Again, attractive alternative partners, literally language title paper,

love design study. study took couples
evaluated members relationship called self-expansion. Now self-
expansion metric involves one's perception self seen
relationship other. something developed by, authors
Aron Aron. last name. assuming either
sibling team somehow related team romantic couple team. A-R-O-N A-R-
O-N, Aron Aron, 1986, proposed self-expansion model close relationships.
proposed "That people motivated enter relationships..." reading here.
"In order enhance self increase self-efficacy." words, one
reasons many people enter relationships makes us feel good
capable. see healthy interdependence, not
necessarily codependence. especially strong beginning relationship,
turns out, people forming pair bonds, case pleasure, arousal

pleasure, arousal excitement, give rise self-expansion, meaning self-efficacy.
self-expansion model really great people
close romantically attached can potentially make us feel, terms
say, terms do, terms way believe feel us.
doesn't necessarily involve explicit statements telling us great
are, great gestures us, actually feel feel us.
Turns strong parameter terms feel

thing love languages?" Right? don't neuroscience support,


think, love languages, not super familiar this, didn't list out,
people are... autonomic nervous system, will, tends
