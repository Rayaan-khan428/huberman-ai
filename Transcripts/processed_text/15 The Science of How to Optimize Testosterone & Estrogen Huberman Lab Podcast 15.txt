00:05:50 Hormone Optimization

don't like product, send back, get money back. month
"Huberman Lab Podcast," talking hormones, incredible
chemicals can impact mood, behavior, feelings optimism
pessimism. amazing thing hormones hormones impact things,
things, feel think also can impact
hormones, really fascinating area biology impacts every single one
us every day wakefulness sleep throughout lifespan. Today,
going talking hormone optimization, mainly going focusing
estrogen testosterone derivatives. Last episode "Huberman Lab
Podcast," talked sexual development, is, chromosomes,
gonads, hormones impact call sexual development, leading way
puberty. Today, mainly going talk processes happen puberty
onward, although might talk little bit development well, today,
going talk lot basic biology, going weave lot practical tools
along way optimize

00:07:00 Salutogenesis: Powerful Way Conceptualize Health

incredibly powerful things call hormones. dive
discussion hormone optimization, want raise think important
point least hadn't heard recently, concept salutogenesis.
Many us familiar concept pathogenesis, idea
scary diseases like dementia heart disease stroke, things
await us don't take good care might await us even
do, pathogenic model, salutogenesis something learned one
Stanford Medicine colleagues, different orientation toward health well-
taking particular behaviors, taking particular stance
towards nutrition exercise, supplementation, et cetera, order promote well-
not behaviors. Now,
think it, two things, salutogenesis pathogenic model, really two
sides coin, just give example might affect real
way. like exercise feels good, great, many people exercise, eat


well, matter, order avoid heart disease avoid dementia, avoid
negative changes body composition, powerful certainly
case exercise will help move away things, salutogenesis
model differs involves mindset orientation towards things
order feels good, order enhance level energy, order improve
endocrine function metabolic function, really part pathogenic model,
yet, salutogenesis really mindset toward
particular behaviors, really, powerful mindset going one
thinking pathogenic model, things don't end sick, et
cetera, move away sickness, well salutogenic model
things order move towards health well-being. think health
wellness nowadays, wellness community wellness practices, many
ways, essence salutogenic model, found interesting know
within field allopathic medicine, two models exist don't hear
salutogenic model quite often, just something keep mind,
especially mindset effects discussed previous
episodes, not going go detail right now, might recall
episode food mood, talked incredible studies
done Alia Crum's group Stanford others showing tell
people behavior do, case, people cleaning
hotel rooms job, tell good them,
see much greater positive health effects aren't aware information
good them, really thinking not just moving away
disease negative things, also certain things good us
well-established now really good scientific studies

00:10:03 Estrogen Testosterone: Sources, Levels & Ratios

keeping mind positive effects things can really outsized effect
well-being, right level physiology. talk hormone
optimization, today going talk hormone optimization reference
estrogen testosterone derivatives, now, estrogen testosterone
derivatives call sex steroids, now, sex steroids immediately call
mind sex, obvious reasons, steroids, meaning anabolic steroids, just want


emphasize estrogen testosterone present everybody, ratios
determine effects, today going talk can optimize
ratios depending particular life goals ratio estrogen
testosterone every individual profound influence feelings well-being, feelings
optimism, feelings anxiety lack anxiety, reproduction, sexual behavior
independent reproduction, profoundly powerful molecules, make
molecules, degree another, also important behavioral
tools, supplementation tools, well prescription drugs can impact ratios
testosterone estrogen really powerful ways, going cover that.
want emphasize hear sex steroids steroid hormones, people
think anabolic steroids, course, anabolic steroids derivatives
testosterone testosterone itself, heavily used abused sports
community well outside sports community, there, course, many
steroids not anabolic steroids also abused sports. Today, not
talking drugs sports, think carries heavy weight people
hear word steroids, think anabolic steroids, today's discussion
will certainly relevant physical performance, fact, going talk
specific types exercise, particular patterns cold exposure, well particular
patterns, believe not, breathing can impact sex steroid hormones, estrogen
testosterone, discussion isn't really geared towards performance enhancement
sport, although will entire episode, perhaps even entire month related
performance enhancement physical enterprises. one first things
understand want optimize hormones come from.
lot different glands body produce hormones, pineal gland,
hormones made hypothalamus, hormones made gonads,
ovaries testes, got thyroid gland, bunch different glands
make different hormones, talking sex steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone, major sources ovaries estrogen
testes testosterone, although adrenals can also make testosterone. Now,
also enzymes, enzymes things can change chemical
composition, enzymes going talk today aromatases
mainly, aromatases convert testosterone estrogen, male, instance,
high testosterone, going converted estrogen
aromatase, aromatase made body fat, also made testes themselves,


lot people don't realize this, testes actually capacity manufacture
estrogen aromatase, albeit low levels, turns important
optimizing hormone levels males later points, discuss that. important
note huge range terms levels hormones, testosterone
estrogen, individuals, actually occurs within individuals across
lifespan, not going throw specific numbers X picograms per deciliter, et
cetera today going vary lot, going depend whether not
measuring picograms nanograms sort thing, want
examine hormones, conjunction medical doctor, ideally,
endocrinologist can help sort information, important thing know
prepubescent females make little estrogen, talk
estrogen, mainly talk estradiol, active form estrogen
males females. prepubescent females, low levels estrogen,
puberty, levels estrogen, AKA estradiol, basically skyrocket, across
lifespan, estrogen going vary depending stage menstrual cycle,
one heads menopause, typically takes place nowadays somewhere
age 45 60, levels estrogen going drop post-menopause levels
estrogen low. well, testosterone will fluctuate across lifespan,
testosterone going relatively low prepuberty males, puberty, going
skyrocket, current numbers drops off rate 1% per
year, although going talk data show actually
tremendous variation testosterone levels, actually lot examples men
90s, 90s, still testosterone levels mimic pubertal levels,
remarkable speaks huge variation testosterone levels across individuals.
talk sources hormones, will make clear
avenues might want take order optimize hormones. glands
tissues body make hormones, testosterone estrogen,
mentioned briefly, adrenals, adrenals right top kidneys,
release steroid hormones adrenals,

00:15:46 Power Competition, Plus: Anxiety, Persistence & Dopamine

particular testosterone related derivatives, mainly activated
competition, talk competition turns competition


powerful influence sex steroid hormones, sex steroid hormones
powerfully influence competition. people don't realize this, males
given mammalian species never get reproduce, fact, never even get
sex all, don't often think that, testosterone plays powerful role
determining members given species will get reproduce, ones
species will actually get access females, not talking humans
specifically, well known species like elephant seals, species like antlered
animals rams, instance, higher levels testosterone correlate
access females. Now, one interpretation females detecting
males high testosterone selecting them, receptive them,
going talk receptivity mating moment, actually
males higher testosterone forage will fight harder females,
really interesting good evidence now testosterone
can reduce anxiety, promote novelty-seeking, promote competitive interactions,
leap far mind think human
behaviors, just stay little bit biology makes
make sense turns pretty simple. brain region called
amygdala, Latin, just means almond, amygdala famous role
fear, hear lot fear amygdala, amygdala really
involved threat detection, sets thresholds anxiety consider scary
much, testosterone secreted gonads elsewhere body binds
amygdala changes threshold stress, said previous
versions podcast podcasts testosterone incredible
effect making effort feel good, really referring fact
testosterone lowers stress anxiety, particular, males given species. Now,
important often think testosterone creating, whatever,
masculinization it's, know, virilization, terms thrown around,
really comes mate choice competition?
reducing threshold anxiety, so, selects individuals given
species push further, willing suffer more, although also reduces pain,
maybe also suffer less, pursuit reproduction females. Now, well known
humans males females elevated levels testosterone will
engage novelty-seeking, want point even individuals without
testes testosterone, peaks testosterone similar effects regardless


whether not someone ovaries testes, testosterone increases generally lead
foraging, novelty-seeking, increases libido, increases desire
mate, case increases testosterone promote competitive foraging-
type behaviors humans nonhuman mammals, also true competition
can increase androgens, testosterone, want repeat that, competitive
environments can increase testosterone. Now, people come
conclusion win, testosterone goes up, lose,
testosterone goes down, extent, true, not direct effect
gonads, actually mediated neuromodulator dopamine, talked
dopamine episode motivation drive, dopamine testosterone
remarkable interplay body, dopamine actually released brain ways
pituitary, gland sits roof mouth, release certain
hormones go promote release testosterone, indeed,
winning promotes dopamine, later, testosterone, however, short
term, just competing increases testosterone independent whether not win
lose, short version competition increases testosterone, may
ancient mechanism whereby androgens, testosterone, feeding
back encourage competitive-type behaviors every species, whether
not talking reproduction resource allocation, involved
competition, not every individual species gets access number mates
quality mates,

00:20:58 Testosterone & Libido Pre-Ovulation

true directions, males females everything between.
just want emphasize case went quickly increases
testosterone females also going lead increase reproductive behavior
seeking reproductive behavior, increase libido, fact, particular phase
menstrual cycle testosterone peaks just ovulation that, average,
leads female humans seek sex otherwise cycle,
self-report, also measuring things like testosterone-
estrogen ratios, forth, really interesting single molecule, regardless
chromosomal gonadal background, increasing seeking mates across
individuals,



00:21:48 Estrogen & Sexual Receptivity; Libido Males

increasing desire compete willingness compete, lowering threshold
stress anxiety. important point increases testosterone
promote seeking mates reproduction males females, females,
actually increases estrogen promote receptivity mating, testosterone
driving seeking sex estrogen promoting actual act sex females,
so-called receptivity, consensual receptivity. males, interesting point
testosterone promoting seeking sex, also estrogen males important
libido, estrogen levels brought low, men will completely lose
libido, often not discussed overlooked discussion testosterone
therapy performance-enhancing drugs, people think hyperandrogenized
individuals, meaning people high levels androgen will high
levels libido, will, provided estrogen available sufficient ratios match
testosterone, not simply case high levels testosterone produce lot
sex mating behavior low levels estrogen good across board,
actually need males females, just females, testosterone
levels always going lower estrogen levels,

00:23:10 Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence

males, estrogen levels always going lower testosterone levels,
testosterone promotes sex-seeking behavior, real question is, sex
promote testosterone? answer somewhat complicated, short
version yes, recall, sex multiple stages, physical act
sex, seeking sex, orgasm ejaculation. Now,
important distinguish whether not sex increases
testosterone depends whether not male ejaculates, important
understand previous episode, mentioned dopamine increases
sexual activity, remember, dopamine testosterone tend increase linearly
one another, ejaculation, release prolactin, prolactin
actually sets refractory period males can't sex again,
duration refractory period will vary tremendously depending much


long prolactin release occurs. also described previous episode
people take vitamin B6, not suggesting anyone this, take vitamin B6 order
reduce prolactin levels thereby reduce duration refractory period,
getting question testosterone sexual behavior, important
distinguish different phases reproduction reproductive behaviors,
studies showing sexual behavior can increase testosterone,
study published 2011 Escasa et al., E-S-C-A-S-A, stuff
textbooks, PubMed, quality studies, showing men observe
sex, guess observing pornography, will slight increases
testosterone observation, people actually willing blood
draws taken watching pornography, increases testosterone
modest, 10%, whereas people participated sex, actually
study people blood draws real sex partners,
70% increases testosterone, increases testosterone
quite significant physical act sex far less observing sex.
Now, question often get, fact, one questions get often
comments YouTube, don't know is, whether not ejaculation adjusts
testosterone levels, turns out, two studies find
quality studies PubMed address this, sex ejaculation not
reduce testosterone levels although will increase prolactin levels reasons
described moment ago, however, abstinence sex without ejaculation week
will increase testosterone levels 400%, answer actually
complicated, not straightforward, means sex increases
testosterone, however, abstinence also increases testosterone even further,
nuanced answer, hope satisfactory, no pun intended,
asking me, relationship sex ejaculation
testosterone dopamine? nuanced, understand nuance
want understand certain behaviors impact hormones

00:26:46 Testosterone & Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs Pair Bonding

hormones impact behaviors. mentioned before, females,
testosterone also primes motivation seek sex, sex also increases
testosterone, also increases prolactin, men women, sex increases


prolactin post-sex, just way system works, testosterone
dopamine increase seeking-out behavior sex, sex,
prolactin levels go up, kind quiescence, whole nervous system
promoted towards calm, may actually something pair-bonding
encouragement individuals spend time together exchange different
smells hormones,

00:27:30 DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): Effects Levels/Ratios

maybe even pheromones, going talk pheromones moment.
years ago, lot excitement hormone DHEA,
mainly made adrenals, DHEA promoted kind catch-all
increasing testosterone estrogen males females, indeed, DHEA will
increase testosterone estrogen, something mindful
thinking taking DHEA taking DHEA already. DHEA will increase
testosterone estrogen, extent increases one will
depend whether not starting off estrogen testosterone
whether not starting off testosterone estrogen whether
not lot aromatase, individuals lot aromatase
made testes body fat, take DHEA, good chance fair
portion going shuttled towards estrogen production not towards
testosterone production, whereas individuals low levels testosterone
begin with, high levels estrogen, good chance DHEA going
promote mainly estrogen production, least find research
studies examined. way think DHEA, kind global promoter
sex steroid hormones, specific effects going depend

00:28:45 Behaviors Decrease Testosterone (& Cortisol): Parenting & Prolactin

little bit started whether not ovaries testes. just
behaviors can increase testosterone, behaviors can
decrease testosterone, one well-characterized ones humans
becoming parent. expecting fathers almost 50% decrease testosterone
levels, free bound testosterone, well, cortisol levels, stress hormone,


drop almost three-fold, incredible, estradiol levels double,
estrogen levels double, expecting fathers many people known put additional
body weight, everyone always thought eating parallel
pregnant wife, turns effects reduced testosterone, increased
estradiol, reduced cortisol can explained increase prolactin, not
just humans, species well, male female species
expecting young, lay body fat, assumption
prepare long nights no sleep, occurs many species, not just humans,
really interesting hormone, prolactin, can start suppressing whole categories
hormones, sex steroid hormones, can start increasing whole categories
ones, hear dad bod, lot explanations dad bod
extend well beyond podcast episode, well-known phenomenon
testosterone going drop, prolactin's going increase, estradiol's going increase
males females expecting children. Now, long lasts
interesting, actually much contact much contact
smells baby, offspring, father happens have, available
unavailable will actually impact level hormones, now, definitely not
promoting idea fathers mothers take time away offspring order
keep testosterone levels high restore them, not saying all,
just interesting point evolutionary mechanisms push us toward bias
us toward particular categories behaviors influencing hormones,
feed back promote particular behavior mentioned before,
peaks testosterone males females cause individuals seek sex, not promote
parenting, whereas reductions testosterone, increases prolactin, decreases
cortisol

00:31:24 Illness Impacts Testosterone & Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6

move individuals sexes toward parenting behavior less toward reproductive
behavior. behavior markedly reduces testosterone males
females markedly reduces desire seeking sex sex illness,
many might say, "Well, duh, people feel sick, "they don't feel like seeking
mates, "they don't feel like sex," ever wondered
actually is? Well, turns can explained release called


inflammatory cytokines, cytokines related immune system, travel
lymph blood, attack invader cells like bacteria viruses,
conditions illness, make lot different cytokines, anti-
inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, best-known example
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, known IL-6, injected individuals,
will decrease desire sex eventually will reduce levels testosterone
estrogen independent feeling lousy, reason people don't want sex
sick levels IL-6 increased. Now, important
start think different ways modulate sex steroid hormones, so-
called optimize hormones, keeping levels IL-6 low going important
exert effects, now, IL-6 doesn't just travel gonads shut
gonads, actually ways interact receptors steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone, bind to, impact receptors
sex steroid hormones can't effect. short put simply, inflammatory
cytokines like IL-6 bad sex steroid hormones, going talk
modulate IL-6 direction want increase another
cytokine called IL-10, anti-inflammatory ways can help promote,
least support,

00:33:20 Exactly Behaviors Change Hormones?

sex steroid hormones. move forward, going now start consider
sorts behavioral practices, well things, can modulate sex steroid
hormones directions want go, that, order
set stage that, asking yourself, it, it,
mechanistic level, behaviors can modulate hormones all? think it,
kind strange just mere act parent parenting can change
testosterone levels dramatically estradiol levels dramatically, it?
sweat baby? saliva? sight baby? holding baby,
things? turns many effects smell,
cases, even possibly pheromones. Now, talked hormones,

light, temperature, talked parenthood, talked competition,
talked pheromone effects, now talk particular forms
exercise modulate steroid hormones, going talk
various supplements, reference testosterone reference
estrogen. now talk exercise various forms, weight training,
endurance work, weight training failure, less intense weight training can impact
testosterone levels, want remind talking testosterone
males females, based know earlier episode,


testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided
optimal range. look web, people will say, "Oh, know,
"testosterone increased weight training, "you want big, heavy
compound movements," squats deadlifts chins things sort,
scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,
squat? squat loading bunch weights bar then, know,
sitting down, essentially, standing again. deadlift?
lifting heavy weights ground. increase testosterone, right?
often not discussed weight training even exercise science
community, actually stimulate release testosterone adrenals
and/or testes, one it, adrenals testes both? often not
discussed, neuroscientist, kinds things think
think always genes don't create behavior, immune systems don't know
activated, lungs don't know inhale exhale, hearts don't know beat
except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen
receptor content, meaning testosterone derivatives, receptor content following
heavy-resistance exercise, find examples that, instance, know,
muscle biopsies, can actually see receptor increases, looking either high-
volume low-volume really intense exercise, can find lot not lot
mechanism nervous system this, reason want
know can potentially build better protocols figure
exactly movements triggering increases androgen receptors
testosterone. interesting start digging mechanistic
studies, find heavy weight training, weight training
sets done anywhere kind one eight rep range, translates
differently depending ratio muscle fiber type forth, basically
people working anywhere like, 70% 95% maximum, sometimes
even going right one-repetition maximum, really kind max effort,
find using nervous system way moving heavy loads,
translate recruitment high-threshold motor units, muscle


physiologists, rule muscle physiology neuron recruitment
moving muscles basically use minimum number motor units neurons
activate muscle possibly can, loads increase, recruit
neurons, always hear recruiting muscle fibers, really, recruiting
neurons recruit muscle fibers, find heavy weight
training, not weight training failure completion repetition impossible,
leads greatest increases testosterone. Now, sure bunch
exercise jockeys going come bunch things where,
oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training
heavy loads, anywhere one-rep maximum somewhere six eight
repetition range, males females, increases testosterone significantly,

well authors, course, point fact something
engagement neurons recruit high-threshold motor units muscle
moving heavy loads, not failure, provide sort feedback signal,
either gonad produce testosterone, increasing activity
receptors body. Now, say that? Well, puzzle, right?
particular movement, just like interacting child, increasing
decreasing testosterone? kind fundamental question mechanistic

smell pheromones, although sure cues well,
clearly influence hard work neural level muscular level


increasing testosterone, also clearly effect working hard
presumably increasing cortisol much, although speculating there, terms
reducing testosterone, reason getting nitty-gritty
ultimately, really like understand, optimal protocols? know,
literature, hear, move heavy objects increase testosterone,
will converted powerful androgen, DHT, 5-alpha reductase et
cetera, really don't understand yet particular behaviors increase
testosterone whether not modulating receptors
modulating testosterone release directly, presumably, testosterone release directly
sensitivity receptors, muscle physiology studies
able find point to, basically boils particular set protocols
want increase testosterone, whatever reason, weight training heavy

solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase
decrease androgen levels whether not combine endurance activity
weight training, whether not effect endurance activity first
second, takeaway endurance activity, performed first,
leads decreases testosterone weight training session compared
weight training session done first followed endurance activity, words,
want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something
recommending,

01:24:41 Estrogen & Menopause: Compounds May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms

just justifying rationale endurance athlete want
all. now switch talking estrogen, many people
trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood
mainly ovary now depleted estrogen production own,
eggs not produced, depleted, et cetera. menopause
characterized variety symptoms, multifaceted, probably deserves
entire episode own, things like hot flashes, things like mood swings, things like
headaches, particular migraine headaches, can lot brain fog, can
very, disruptive people. Now, sometimes hear andropause,


thought kind analog menopause, menopause certain
characteristics make robust phenomenon women, whereas
men, andropause going sometimes happen, sometimes won't, fact, without going
details graphs data, clear, mentioned earlier,
men maintain levels circulating androgens quite high, even similar

drugs like tamoxifen anastrozole drugs block either
aromatase block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly initially developed,
see lot internet, again, sports folks trying increase

always, always, always, except extreme cases, going far subtler, excuse me, far
subtle, use proper English, far subtle be, instance, just
injecting testosterone injecting estrogen, et cetera, think just
honest upfront that. thus far terms talking optimizing hormones

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone
background menstrual cycle really going disrupt way things interact,
just exquisite feedback loop, not saying don't that,
definitely want aware doing, blood draws one way
that, monitoring cycles ovulating females another way that, males,
good window going testosterone, DHT, aromatase,
estradiol, LH, et cetera, just vital, really part parcel practice
thinking optimizing incredible things call sex steroid hormones,

01:57:18 Additional Compounds, Liver Toxicity, Overall Milieu

estrogen testosterone derivatives. list supplements molecules
can adjust estrogen testosterone vast, touched these,
really tried emphasize ones human studies mostly
human studies, maybe even just one human study, things
scientific data, things like Bulbine natalensis, definitely
support increasing testosterone studies rats, think
evidence humans evidence mainly comes form call
sponsored research, companies paying research, different
independent research people not biased terms outcome,

similar high levels anabolic exogenous steroids, problems associated
make them, know, important think curious
area endocrinology, also somewhat precarious, know, one
category, stuff doesn't lot evidence humans, might actually
dangerous, category things shown improve levels of,


increase, say, don't want say improve whether not
want increase decrease estrogen testosterone, highly individual,
know, things kind housekeeping production estrogen
testosterone, things like magnesium, things like D3, things like zinc, know,
things going create overall milieu opportunity produce normal
endogenous levels rather increasing endogenous levels further, really want
highlight difference taking something create kind

"Huberman Lab Podcast," talking hormones, incredible
chemicals can impact mood, behavior, feelings optimism
pessimism. amazing thing hormones hormones impact things,
things, feel think also can impact
hormones, really fascinating area biology impacts every single one
us every day wakefulness sleep throughout lifespan. Today,
going talking hormone optimization, mainly going focusing
estrogen testosterone derivatives. Last episode "Huberman Lab
Podcast," talked sexual development, is, chromosomes,
gonads, hormones impact call sexual development, leading way

onward, although might talk little bit development well, today,
going talk lot basic biology, going weave lot practical tools
along way optimize

00:07:00 Salutogenesis: Powerful Way Conceptualize Health

incredibly powerful things call hormones. dive
discussion hormone optimization, want raise think important
point least hadn't heard recently, concept salutogenesis.
Many us familiar concept pathogenesis, idea
scary diseases like dementia heart disease stroke, things
await us don't take good care might await us even
do, pathogenic model, salutogenesis something learned one
Stanford Medicine colleagues, different orientation toward health well-
taking particular behaviors, taking particular stance
towards nutrition exercise, supplementation, et cetera, order promote well-
not behaviors. Now,
think it, two things, salutogenesis pathogenic model, really two
sides coin, just give example might affect real
way. like exercise feels good, great, many people exercise, eat


well, matter, order avoid heart disease avoid dementia, avoid
negative changes body composition, powerful certainly
case exercise will help move away things, salutogenesis
model differs involves mindset orientation towards things
order feels good, order enhance level energy, order improve
endocrine function metabolic function, really part pathogenic model,
yet, salutogenesis really mindset toward
particular behaviors, really, powerful mindset going one
thinking pathogenic model, things don't end sick, et
cetera, move away sickness, well salutogenic model
things order move towards health well-being. think health
wellness nowadays, wellness community wellness practices, many
ways, essence salutogenic model, found interesting know
within field allopathic medicine, two models exist don't hear
salutogenic model quite often, just something keep mind,
especially mindset effects discussed previous
episodes, not going go detail right now, might recall
episode food mood, talked incredible studies
done Alia Crum's group Stanford others showing tell
people behavior do, case, people cleaning
hotel rooms job, tell good them,
see much greater positive health effects aren't aware information
good them, really thinking not just moving away
disease negative things, also certain things good us
well-established now really good scientific studies

00:10:03 Estrogen Testosterone: Sources, Levels & Ratios

keeping mind positive effects things can really outsized effect
well-being, right level physiology. talk hormone
optimization, today going talk hormone optimization reference
estrogen testosterone derivatives, now, estrogen testosterone
derivatives call sex steroids, now, sex steroids immediately call
mind sex, obvious reasons, steroids, meaning anabolic steroids, just want


emphasize estrogen testosterone present everybody, ratios
determine effects, today going talk can optimize
ratios depending particular life goals ratio estrogen
testosterone every individual profound influence feelings well-being, feelings
optimism, feelings anxiety lack anxiety, reproduction, sexual behavior
independent reproduction, profoundly powerful molecules, make
molecules, degree another, also important behavioral
tools, supplementation tools, well prescription drugs can impact ratios
testosterone estrogen really powerful ways, going cover that.
want emphasize hear sex steroids steroid hormones, people
think anabolic steroids, course, anabolic steroids derivatives
testosterone testosterone itself, heavily used abused sports
community well outside sports community, there, course, many
steroids not anabolic steroids also abused sports. Today, not
talking drugs sports, think carries heavy weight people
hear word steroids, think anabolic steroids, today's discussion
will certainly relevant physical performance, fact, going talk
specific types exercise, particular patterns cold exposure, well particular
patterns, believe not, breathing can impact sex steroid hormones, estrogen
testosterone, discussion isn't really geared towards performance enhancement
sport, although will entire episode, perhaps even entire month related
performance enhancement physical enterprises. one first things
understand want optimize hormones come from.
lot different glands body produce hormones, pineal gland,
hormones made hypothalamus, hormones made gonads,
ovaries testes, got thyroid gland, bunch different glands
make different hormones, talking sex steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone, major sources ovaries estrogen
testes testosterone, although adrenals can also make testosterone. Now,
also enzymes, enzymes things can change chemical
composition, enzymes going talk today aromatases
mainly, aromatases convert testosterone estrogen, male, instance,
high testosterone, going converted estrogen
aromatase, aromatase made body fat, also made testes themselves,


lot people don't realize this, testes actually capacity manufacture
estrogen aromatase, albeit low levels, turns important
optimizing hormone levels males later points, discuss that. important
note huge range terms levels hormones, testosterone
estrogen, individuals, actually occurs within individuals across
lifespan, not going throw specific numbers X picograms per deciliter, et
cetera today going vary lot, going depend whether not
measuring picograms nanograms sort thing, want
examine hormones, conjunction medical doctor, ideally,
endocrinologist can help sort information, important thing know
prepubescent females make little estrogen, talk
estrogen, mainly talk estradiol, active form estrogen
males females. prepubescent females, low levels estrogen,
puberty, levels estrogen, AKA estradiol, basically skyrocket, across
lifespan, estrogen going vary depending stage menstrual cycle,
one heads menopause, typically takes place nowadays somewhere
age 45 60, levels estrogen going drop post-menopause levels
estrogen low. well, testosterone will fluctuate across lifespan,
testosterone going relatively low prepuberty males, puberty, going
skyrocket, current numbers drops off rate 1% per
year, although going talk data show actually
tremendous variation testosterone levels, actually lot examples men
90s, 90s, still testosterone levels mimic pubertal levels,
remarkable speaks huge variation testosterone levels across individuals.
talk sources hormones, will make clear
avenues might want take order optimize hormones. glands
tissues body make hormones, testosterone estrogen,
mentioned briefly, adrenals, adrenals right top kidneys,
release steroid hormones adrenals,

00:15:46 Power Competition, Plus: Anxiety, Persistence & Dopamine

particular testosterone related derivatives, mainly activated
competition, talk competition turns competition


powerful influence sex steroid hormones, sex steroid hormones
powerfully influence competition. people don't realize this, males
given mammalian species never get reproduce, fact, never even get
sex all, don't often think that, testosterone plays powerful role
determining members given species will get reproduce, ones
species will actually get access females, not talking humans
specifically, well known species like elephant seals, species like antlered
animals rams, instance, higher levels testosterone correlate
access females. Now, one interpretation females detecting
males high testosterone selecting them, receptive them,
going talk receptivity mating moment, actually
males higher testosterone forage will fight harder females,
really interesting good evidence now testosterone
can reduce anxiety, promote novelty-seeking, promote competitive interactions,
leap far mind think human
behaviors, just stay little bit biology makes
make sense turns pretty simple. brain region called
amygdala, Latin, just means almond, amygdala famous role
fear, hear lot fear amygdala, amygdala really
involved threat detection, sets thresholds anxiety consider scary
much, testosterone secreted gonads elsewhere body binds
amygdala changes threshold stress, said previous
versions podcast podcasts testosterone incredible
effect making effort feel good, really referring fact
testosterone lowers stress anxiety, particular, males given species. Now,
important often think testosterone creating, whatever,
masculinization it's, know, virilization, terms thrown around,
really comes mate choice competition?
reducing threshold anxiety, so, selects individuals given
species push further, willing suffer more, although also reduces pain,
maybe also suffer less, pursuit reproduction females. Now, well known
humans males females elevated levels testosterone will
engage novelty-seeking, want point even individuals without
testes testosterone, peaks testosterone similar effects regardless


whether not someone ovaries testes, testosterone increases generally lead
foraging, novelty-seeking, increases libido, increases desire
mate, case increases testosterone promote competitive foraging-
type behaviors humans nonhuman mammals, also true competition
can increase androgens, testosterone, want repeat that, competitive
environments can increase testosterone. Now, people come
conclusion win, testosterone goes up, lose,
testosterone goes down, extent, true, not direct effect
gonads, actually mediated neuromodulator dopamine, talked
dopamine episode motivation drive, dopamine testosterone
remarkable interplay body, dopamine actually released brain ways
pituitary, gland sits roof mouth, release certain
hormones go promote release testosterone, indeed,
winning promotes dopamine, later, testosterone, however, short
term, just competing increases testosterone independent whether not win
lose, short version competition increases testosterone, may
ancient mechanism whereby androgens, testosterone, feeding
back encourage competitive-type behaviors every species, whether
not talking reproduction resource allocation, involved
competition, not every individual species gets access number mates
quality mates,

00:20:58 Testosterone & Libido Pre-Ovulation

true directions, males females everything between.
just want emphasize case went quickly increases
testosterone females also going lead increase reproductive behavior
seeking reproductive behavior, increase libido, fact, particular phase
menstrual cycle testosterone peaks just ovulation that, average,
leads female humans seek sex otherwise cycle,
self-report, also measuring things like testosterone-
estrogen ratios, forth, really interesting single molecule, regardless
chromosomal gonadal background, increasing seeking mates across
individuals,



00:21:48 Estrogen & Sexual Receptivity; Libido Males

increasing desire compete willingness compete, lowering threshold
stress anxiety. important point increases testosterone
promote seeking mates reproduction males females, females,
actually increases estrogen promote receptivity mating, testosterone
driving seeking sex estrogen promoting actual act sex females,
so-called receptivity, consensual receptivity. males, interesting point
testosterone promoting seeking sex, also estrogen males important
libido, estrogen levels brought low, men will completely lose
libido, often not discussed overlooked discussion testosterone
therapy performance-enhancing drugs, people think hyperandrogenized
individuals, meaning people high levels androgen will high
levels libido, will, provided estrogen available sufficient ratios match
testosterone, not simply case high levels testosterone produce lot
sex mating behavior low levels estrogen good across board,
actually need males females, just females, testosterone
levels always going lower estrogen levels,

00:23:10 Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence

males, estrogen levels always going lower testosterone levels,
testosterone promotes sex-seeking behavior, real question is, sex
promote testosterone? answer somewhat complicated, short
version yes, recall, sex multiple stages, physical act
sex, seeking sex, orgasm ejaculation. Now,
important distinguish whether not sex increases
testosterone depends whether not male ejaculates, important
understand previous episode, mentioned dopamine increases
sexual activity, remember, dopamine testosterone tend increase linearly
one another, ejaculation, release prolactin, prolactin
actually sets refractory period males can't sex again,
duration refractory period will vary tremendously depending much


long prolactin release occurs. also described previous episode
people take vitamin B6, not suggesting anyone this, take vitamin B6 order
reduce prolactin levels thereby reduce duration refractory period,
getting question testosterone sexual behavior, important
distinguish different phases reproduction reproductive behaviors,
studies showing sexual behavior can increase testosterone,
study published 2011 Escasa et al., E-S-C-A-S-A, stuff
textbooks, PubMed, quality studies, showing men observe
sex, guess observing pornography, will slight increases
testosterone observation, people actually willing blood
draws taken watching pornography, increases testosterone
modest, 10%, whereas people participated sex, actually
study people blood draws real sex partners,
70% increases testosterone, increases testosterone
quite significant physical act sex far less observing sex.
Now, question often get, fact, one questions get often
comments YouTube, don't know is, whether not ejaculation adjusts
testosterone levels, turns out, two studies find
quality studies PubMed address this, sex ejaculation not
reduce testosterone levels although will increase prolactin levels reasons
described moment ago, however, abstinence sex without ejaculation week
will increase testosterone levels 400%, answer actually
complicated, not straightforward, means sex increases
testosterone, however, abstinence also increases testosterone even further,
nuanced answer, hope satisfactory, no pun intended,
asking me, relationship sex ejaculation
testosterone dopamine? nuanced, understand nuance
want understand certain behaviors impact hormones

00:26:46 Testosterone & Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs Pair Bonding

hormones impact behaviors. mentioned before, females,
testosterone also primes motivation seek sex, sex also increases
testosterone, also increases prolactin, men women, sex increases


prolactin post-sex, just way system works, testosterone
dopamine increase seeking-out behavior sex, sex,
prolactin levels go up, kind quiescence, whole nervous system
promoted towards calm, may actually something pair-bonding
encouragement individuals spend time together exchange different
smells hormones,

00:27:30 DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): Effects Levels/Ratios

maybe even pheromones, going talk pheromones moment.
years ago, lot excitement hormone DHEA,
mainly made adrenals, DHEA promoted kind catch-all
increasing testosterone estrogen males females, indeed, DHEA will
increase testosterone estrogen, something mindful
thinking taking DHEA taking DHEA already. DHEA will increase
testosterone estrogen, extent increases one will
depend whether not starting off estrogen testosterone
whether not starting off testosterone estrogen whether
not lot aromatase, individuals lot aromatase
made testes body fat, take DHEA, good chance fair
portion going shuttled towards estrogen production not towards
testosterone production, whereas individuals low levels testosterone
begin with, high levels estrogen, good chance DHEA going
promote mainly estrogen production, least find research
studies examined. way think DHEA, kind global promoter
sex steroid hormones, specific effects going depend

00:28:45 Behaviors Decrease Testosterone (& Cortisol): Parenting & Prolactin

little bit started whether not ovaries testes. just
behaviors can increase testosterone, behaviors can
decrease testosterone, one well-characterized ones humans
becoming parent. expecting fathers almost 50% decrease testosterone
levels, free bound testosterone, well, cortisol levels, stress hormone,


drop almost three-fold, incredible, estradiol levels double,
estrogen levels double, expecting fathers many people known put additional
body weight, everyone always thought eating parallel
pregnant wife, turns effects reduced testosterone, increased
estradiol, reduced cortisol can explained increase prolactin, not
just humans, species well, male female species
expecting young, lay body fat, assumption
prepare long nights no sleep, occurs many species, not just humans,
really interesting hormone, prolactin, can start suppressing whole categories
hormones, sex steroid hormones, can start increasing whole categories
ones, hear dad bod, lot explanations dad bod
extend well beyond podcast episode, well-known phenomenon
testosterone going drop, prolactin's going increase, estradiol's going increase
males females expecting children. Now, long lasts
interesting, actually much contact much contact
smells baby, offspring, father happens have, available
unavailable will actually impact level hormones, now, definitely not
promoting idea fathers mothers take time away offspring order
keep testosterone levels high restore them, not saying all,
just interesting point evolutionary mechanisms push us toward bias
us toward particular categories behaviors influencing hormones,
feed back promote particular behavior mentioned before,
peaks testosterone males females cause individuals seek sex, not promote
parenting, whereas reductions testosterone, increases prolactin, decreases
cortisol

00:31:24 Illness Impacts Testosterone & Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6

move individuals sexes toward parenting behavior less toward reproductive
behavior. behavior markedly reduces testosterone males
females markedly reduces desire seeking sex sex illness,
many might say, "Well, duh, people feel sick, "they don't feel like seeking
mates, "they don't feel like sex," ever wondered
actually is? Well, turns can explained release called


inflammatory cytokines, cytokines related immune system, travel
lymph blood, attack invader cells like bacteria viruses,
conditions illness, make lot different cytokines, anti-
inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, best-known example
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, known IL-6, injected individuals,
will decrease desire sex eventually will reduce levels testosterone
estrogen independent feeling lousy, reason people don't want sex
sick levels IL-6 increased. Now, important
start think different ways modulate sex steroid hormones, so-
called optimize hormones, keeping levels IL-6 low going important
exert effects, now, IL-6 doesn't just travel gonads shut
gonads, actually ways interact receptors steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone, bind to, impact receptors
sex steroid hormones can't effect. short put simply, inflammatory
cytokines like IL-6 bad sex steroid hormones, going talk
modulate IL-6 direction want increase another
cytokine called IL-10, anti-inflammatory ways can help promote,
least support,

00:33:20 Exactly Behaviors Change Hormones?

sex steroid hormones. move forward, going now start consider
sorts behavioral practices, well things, can modulate sex steroid
hormones directions want go, that, order
set stage that, asking yourself, it, it,
mechanistic level, behaviors can modulate hormones all? think it,
kind strange just mere act parent parenting can change
testosterone levels dramatically estradiol levels dramatically, it?
sweat baby? saliva? sight baby? holding baby,
things? turns many effects smell,
cases, even possibly pheromones. Now, talked hormones,

hormones, again, chemical, travels body, impacts tissues cells
elsewhere body, pheromone chemical released one member
species goes impacts members elsewhere, species, even

well-established ones animals, mentioned one two
previous podcasts, haven't mentioned several them, going talk
evidence pheromones humans well-established. main ones
animals discussed called Lee-Boot effect, Whitten effect, Bruce

Lee-Boot effect house females given species together no males,
start displaying longer, called estrus cycles, many species, don't

"or not," pheromone effect mirrors Lee-Boot effect humans still

01:06:03 Temperature: Cold & Hot Gonads

already have. Okay, talked breathing, talked light,
talk third element seems excitement lately
reasons can actually pretty profound influences hormone


levels, heat cold, always, rather just offer tool, going
tell underlying science relates naturally occurring phenomena because,
understanding understanding mechanism, going far
better position understand tools mechanisms might want

lot lore around heating gonads much, actually whole set

now talked breathing,

01:14:10 Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing

light, temperature, talked parenthood, talked competition,
talked pheromone effects, now talk particular forms
exercise modulate steroid hormones, going talk
various supplements, reference testosterone reference
estrogen. now talk exercise various forms, weight training,
endurance work, weight training failure, less intense weight training can impact
testosterone levels, want remind talking testosterone
males females, based know earlier episode,


testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided
optimal range. look web, people will say, "Oh, know,
"testosterone increased weight training, "you want big, heavy
compound movements," squats deadlifts chins things sort,
scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,
squat? squat loading bunch weights bar then, know,
sitting down, essentially, standing again. deadlift?
lifting heavy weights ground. increase testosterone, right?
often not discussed weight training even exercise science
community, actually stimulate release testosterone adrenals
and/or testes, one it, adrenals testes both? often not
discussed, neuroscientist, kinds things think
think always genes don't create behavior, immune systems don't know
activated, lungs don't know inhale exhale, hearts don't know beat
except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen
receptor content, meaning testosterone derivatives, receptor content following
heavy-resistance exercise, find examples that, instance, know,
muscle biopsies, can actually see receptor increases, looking either high-
volume low-volume really intense exercise, can find lot not lot
mechanism nervous system this, reason want
know can potentially build better protocols figure
exactly movements triggering increases androgen receptors
testosterone. interesting start digging mechanistic
studies, find heavy weight training, weight training
sets done anywhere kind one eight rep range, translates
differently depending ratio muscle fiber type forth, basically
people working anywhere like, 70% 95% maximum, sometimes
even going right one-repetition maximum, really kind max effort,
find using nervous system way moving heavy loads,
translate recruitment high-threshold motor units, muscle


physiologists, rule muscle physiology neuron recruitment
moving muscles basically use minimum number motor units neurons
activate muscle possibly can, loads increase, recruit
neurons, always hear recruiting muscle fibers, really, recruiting
neurons recruit muscle fibers, find heavy weight
training, not weight training failure completion repetition impossible,
leads greatest increases testosterone. Now, sure bunch
exercise jockeys going come bunch things where,
oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training
heavy loads, anywhere one-rep maximum somewhere six eight
repetition range, males females, increases testosterone significantly,

well authors, course, point fact something
engagement neurons recruit high-threshold motor units muscle
moving heavy loads, not failure, provide sort feedback signal,
either gonad produce testosterone, increasing activity
receptors body. Now, say that? Well, puzzle, right?
particular movement, just like interacting child, increasing
decreasing testosterone? kind fundamental question mechanistic

smell pheromones, although sure cues well,
clearly influence hard work neural level muscular level


increasing testosterone, also clearly effect working hard
presumably increasing cortisol much, although speculating there, terms
reducing testosterone, reason getting nitty-gritty
ultimately, really like understand, optimal protocols? know,
literature, hear, move heavy objects increase testosterone,
will converted powerful androgen, DHT, 5-alpha reductase et
cetera, really don't understand yet particular behaviors increase
testosterone whether not modulating receptors
modulating testosterone release directly, presumably, testosterone release directly
sensitivity receptors, muscle physiology studies
able find point to, basically boils particular set protocols
want increase testosterone, whatever reason, weight training heavy
loads not failure seems best-supported, least scientifically supported,
solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase
decrease androgen levels whether not combine endurance activity
weight training, whether not effect endurance activity first
second, takeaway endurance activity, performed first,
leads decreases testosterone weight training session compared
weight training session done first followed endurance activity, words,
want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something
recommending,

01:24:41 Estrogen & Menopause: Compounds May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms

just justifying rationale endurance athlete want
all. now switch talking estrogen, many people
trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper

important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want
understand exactly negative effects not sufficient zinc
magnesium, levels might actually be, paper available,

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual

supplementation, say, individuals can quite dramatic,
always, always, always, except extreme cases, going far subtler, excuse me, far
subtle, use proper English, far subtle be, instance, just

honest upfront that. thus far terms talking optimizing hormones

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject

testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone

estrogen testosterone derivatives, now, estrogen testosterone
derivatives call sex steroids, now, sex steroids immediately call

want emphasize hear sex steroids steroid hormones, people
think anabolic steroids, course, anabolic steroids derivatives
testosterone testosterone itself, heavily used abused sports
community well outside sports community, there, course, many
steroids not anabolic steroids also abused sports. Today, not
talking drugs sports, think carries heavy weight people
hear word steroids, think anabolic steroids, today's discussion
will certainly relevant physical performance, fact, going talk
specific types exercise, particular patterns cold exposure, well particular
patterns, believe not, breathing can impact sex steroid hormones, estrogen
testosterone, discussion isn't really geared towards performance enhancement
sport, although will entire episode, perhaps even entire month related
performance enhancement physical enterprises. one first things
understand want optimize hormones come from.
lot different glands body produce hormones, pineal gland,
hormones made hypothalamus, hormones made gonads,
ovaries testes, got thyroid gland, bunch different glands
make different hormones, talking sex steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone, major sources ovaries estrogen
testes testosterone, although adrenals can also make testosterone. Now,
also enzymes, enzymes things can change chemical
composition, enzymes going talk today aromatases
mainly, aromatases convert testosterone estrogen, male, instance,
high testosterone, going converted estrogen
aromatase, aromatase made body fat, also made testes themselves,


lot people don't realize this, testes actually capacity manufacture
estrogen aromatase, albeit low levels, turns important
optimizing hormone levels males later points, discuss that. important
note huge range terms levels hormones, testosterone
estrogen, individuals, actually occurs within individuals across
lifespan, not going throw specific numbers X picograms per deciliter, et
cetera today going vary lot, going depend whether not
measuring picograms nanograms sort thing, want
examine hormones, conjunction medical doctor, ideally,
endocrinologist can help sort information, important thing know
prepubescent females make little estrogen, talk
estrogen, mainly talk estradiol, active form estrogen
males females. prepubescent females, low levels estrogen,
puberty, levels estrogen, AKA estradiol, basically skyrocket, across
lifespan, estrogen going vary depending stage menstrual cycle,
one heads menopause, typically takes place nowadays somewhere
age 45 60, levels estrogen going drop post-menopause levels
estrogen low. well, testosterone will fluctuate across lifespan,
testosterone going relatively low prepuberty males, puberty, going
skyrocket, current numbers drops off rate 1% per
year, although going talk data show actually
tremendous variation testosterone levels, actually lot examples men
90s, 90s, still testosterone levels mimic pubertal levels,
remarkable speaks huge variation testosterone levels across individuals.
talk sources hormones, will make clear
avenues might want take order optimize hormones. glands
tissues body make hormones, testosterone estrogen,
mentioned briefly, adrenals, adrenals right top kidneys,
release steroid hormones adrenals,

00:15:46 Power Competition, Plus: Anxiety, Persistence & Dopamine

particular testosterone related derivatives, mainly activated
competition, talk competition turns competition


powerful influence sex steroid hormones, sex steroid hormones
powerfully influence competition. people don't realize this, males
given mammalian species never get reproduce, fact, never even get
sex all, don't often think that, testosterone plays powerful role
determining members given species will get reproduce, ones
species will actually get access females, not talking humans
specifically, well known species like elephant seals, species like antlered
animals rams, instance, higher levels testosterone correlate
access females. Now, one interpretation females detecting
males high testosterone selecting them, receptive them,
going talk receptivity mating moment, actually
males higher testosterone forage will fight harder females,
really interesting good evidence now testosterone
can reduce anxiety, promote novelty-seeking, promote competitive interactions,
leap far mind think human
behaviors, just stay little bit biology makes
make sense turns pretty simple. brain region called
amygdala, Latin, just means almond, amygdala famous role
fear, hear lot fear amygdala, amygdala really
involved threat detection, sets thresholds anxiety consider scary
much, testosterone secreted gonads elsewhere body binds
amygdala changes threshold stress, said previous
versions podcast podcasts testosterone incredible
effect making effort feel good, really referring fact
testosterone lowers stress anxiety, particular, males given species. Now,
important often think testosterone creating, whatever,
masculinization it's, know, virilization, terms thrown around,
really comes mate choice competition?
reducing threshold anxiety, so, selects individuals given
species push further, willing suffer more, although also reduces pain,
maybe also suffer less, pursuit reproduction females. Now, well known
humans males females elevated levels testosterone will
engage novelty-seeking, want point even individuals without
testes testosterone, peaks testosterone similar effects regardless


whether not someone ovaries testes, testosterone increases generally lead
foraging, novelty-seeking, increases libido, increases desire
mate, case increases testosterone promote competitive foraging-
type behaviors humans nonhuman mammals, also true competition
can increase androgens, testosterone, want repeat that, competitive
environments can increase testosterone. Now, people come
conclusion win, testosterone goes up, lose,
testosterone goes down, extent, true, not direct effect
gonads, actually mediated neuromodulator dopamine, talked
dopamine episode motivation drive, dopamine testosterone
remarkable interplay body, dopamine actually released brain ways
pituitary, gland sits roof mouth, release certain
hormones go promote release testosterone, indeed,
winning promotes dopamine, later, testosterone, however, short
term, just competing increases testosterone independent whether not win
lose, short version competition increases testosterone, may
ancient mechanism whereby androgens, testosterone, feeding
back encourage competitive-type behaviors every species, whether
not talking reproduction resource allocation, involved
competition, not every individual species gets access number mates
quality mates,

00:20:58 Testosterone & Libido Pre-Ovulation

true directions, males females everything between.
just want emphasize case went quickly increases
testosterone females also going lead increase reproductive behavior
seeking reproductive behavior, increase libido, fact, particular phase
menstrual cycle testosterone peaks just ovulation that, average,
leads female humans seek sex otherwise cycle,
self-report, also measuring things like testosterone-
estrogen ratios, forth, really interesting single molecule, regardless
chromosomal gonadal background, increasing seeking mates across
individuals,



00:21:48 Estrogen & Sexual Receptivity; Libido Males

increasing desire compete willingness compete, lowering threshold
stress anxiety. important point increases testosterone
promote seeking mates reproduction males females, females,
actually increases estrogen promote receptivity mating, testosterone
driving seeking sex estrogen promoting actual act sex females,
so-called receptivity, consensual receptivity. males, interesting point
testosterone promoting seeking sex, also estrogen males important
libido, estrogen levels brought low, men will completely lose
libido, often not discussed overlooked discussion testosterone
therapy performance-enhancing drugs, people think hyperandrogenized
individuals, meaning people high levels androgen will high
levels libido, will, provided estrogen available sufficient ratios match
testosterone, not simply case high levels testosterone produce lot
sex mating behavior low levels estrogen good across board,
actually need males females, just females, testosterone
levels always going lower estrogen levels,

00:23:10 Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence

males, estrogen levels always going lower testosterone levels,
testosterone promotes sex-seeking behavior, real question is, sex
promote testosterone? answer somewhat complicated, short
version yes, recall, sex multiple stages, physical act
sex, seeking sex, orgasm ejaculation. Now,
important distinguish whether not sex increases
testosterone depends whether not male ejaculates, important
understand previous episode, mentioned dopamine increases
sexual activity, remember, dopamine testosterone tend increase linearly
one another, ejaculation, release prolactin, prolactin
actually sets refractory period males can't sex again,
duration refractory period will vary tremendously depending much


long prolactin release occurs. also described previous episode
people take vitamin B6, not suggesting anyone this, take vitamin B6 order
reduce prolactin levels thereby reduce duration refractory period,
getting question testosterone sexual behavior, important
distinguish different phases reproduction reproductive behaviors,
studies showing sexual behavior can increase testosterone,
study published 2011 Escasa et al., E-S-C-A-S-A, stuff
textbooks, PubMed, quality studies, showing men observe
sex, guess observing pornography, will slight increases
testosterone observation, people actually willing blood
draws taken watching pornography, increases testosterone
modest, 10%, whereas people participated sex, actually
study people blood draws real sex partners,
70% increases testosterone, increases testosterone
quite significant physical act sex far less observing sex.
Now, question often get, fact, one questions get often
comments YouTube, don't know is, whether not ejaculation adjusts
testosterone levels, turns out, two studies find
quality studies PubMed address this, sex ejaculation not
reduce testosterone levels although will increase prolactin levels reasons
described moment ago, however, abstinence sex without ejaculation week
will increase testosterone levels 400%, answer actually
complicated, not straightforward, means sex increases
testosterone, however, abstinence also increases testosterone even further,
nuanced answer, hope satisfactory, no pun intended,
asking me, relationship sex ejaculation
testosterone dopamine? nuanced, understand nuance
want understand certain behaviors impact hormones

00:26:46 Testosterone & Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs Pair Bonding

hormones impact behaviors. mentioned before, females,
testosterone also primes motivation seek sex, sex also increases
testosterone, also increases prolactin, men women, sex increases


prolactin post-sex, just way system works, testosterone
dopamine increase seeking-out behavior sex, sex,
prolactin levels go up, kind quiescence, whole nervous system
promoted towards calm, may actually something pair-bonding
encouragement individuals spend time together exchange different
smells hormones,

00:27:30 DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): Effects Levels/Ratios

maybe even pheromones, going talk pheromones moment.
years ago, lot excitement hormone DHEA,
mainly made adrenals, DHEA promoted kind catch-all
increasing testosterone estrogen males females, indeed, DHEA will
increase testosterone estrogen, something mindful
thinking taking DHEA taking DHEA already. DHEA will increase
testosterone estrogen, extent increases one will
depend whether not starting off estrogen testosterone
whether not starting off testosterone estrogen whether
not lot aromatase, individuals lot aromatase
made testes body fat, take DHEA, good chance fair
portion going shuttled towards estrogen production not towards
testosterone production, whereas individuals low levels testosterone
begin with, high levels estrogen, good chance DHEA going
promote mainly estrogen production, least find research
studies examined. way think DHEA, kind global promoter
sex steroid hormones, specific effects going depend

00:28:45 Behaviors Decrease Testosterone (& Cortisol): Parenting & Prolactin

little bit started whether not ovaries testes. just
behaviors can increase testosterone, behaviors can
decrease testosterone, one well-characterized ones humans
becoming parent. expecting fathers almost 50% decrease testosterone
levels, free bound testosterone, well, cortisol levels, stress hormone,


drop almost three-fold, incredible, estradiol levels double,
estrogen levels double, expecting fathers many people known put additional
body weight, everyone always thought eating parallel
pregnant wife, turns effects reduced testosterone, increased
estradiol, reduced cortisol can explained increase prolactin, not
just humans, species well, male female species
expecting young, lay body fat, assumption
prepare long nights no sleep, occurs many species, not just humans,
really interesting hormone, prolactin, can start suppressing whole categories
hormones, sex steroid hormones, can start increasing whole categories
ones, hear dad bod, lot explanations dad bod
extend well beyond podcast episode, well-known phenomenon
testosterone going drop, prolactin's going increase, estradiol's going increase
males females expecting children. Now, long lasts
interesting, actually much contact much contact
smells baby, offspring, father happens have, available
unavailable will actually impact level hormones, now, definitely not
promoting idea fathers mothers take time away offspring order
keep testosterone levels high restore them, not saying all,
just interesting point evolutionary mechanisms push us toward bias
us toward particular categories behaviors influencing hormones,
feed back promote particular behavior mentioned before,
peaks testosterone males females cause individuals seek sex, not promote
parenting, whereas reductions testosterone, increases prolactin, decreases
cortisol

00:31:24 Illness Impacts Testosterone & Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6

move individuals sexes toward parenting behavior less toward reproductive
behavior. behavior markedly reduces testosterone males
females markedly reduces desire seeking sex sex illness,
many might say, "Well, duh, people feel sick, "they don't feel like seeking
mates, "they don't feel like sex," ever wondered
actually is? Well, turns can explained release called


inflammatory cytokines, cytokines related immune system, travel
lymph blood, attack invader cells like bacteria viruses,
conditions illness, make lot different cytokines, anti-
inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, best-known example
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, known IL-6, injected individuals,
will decrease desire sex eventually will reduce levels testosterone
estrogen independent feeling lousy, reason people don't want sex
sick levels IL-6 increased. Now, important
start think different ways modulate sex steroid hormones, so-
called optimize hormones, keeping levels IL-6 low going important
exert effects, now, IL-6 doesn't just travel gonads shut
gonads, actually ways interact receptors steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone, bind to, impact receptors
sex steroid hormones can't effect. short put simply, inflammatory
cytokines like IL-6 bad sex steroid hormones, going talk
modulate IL-6 direction want increase another
cytokine called IL-10, anti-inflammatory ways can help promote,
least support,

00:33:20 Exactly Behaviors Change Hormones?

sex steroid hormones. move forward, going now start consider
sorts behavioral practices, well things, can modulate sex steroid
hormones directions want go, that, order
set stage that, asking yourself, it, it,
mechanistic level, behaviors can modulate hormones all? think it,
kind strange just mere act parent parenting can change
testosterone levels dramatically estradiol levels dramatically, it?
sweat baby? saliva? sight baby? holding baby,
things? turns many effects smell,
cases, even possibly pheromones. Now, talked hormones,

hormones, again, chemical, travels body, impacts tissues cells
elsewhere body, pheromone chemical released one member
species goes impacts members elsewhere, species, even
species. Now, pheromone effects absolutely well-established lots animal
species, controversial humans. Today, going talk
well-established ones animals, mentioned one two
previous podcasts, haven't mentioned several them, going talk
evidence pheromones humans well-established. main ones
animals discussed called Lee-Boot effect, Whitten effect, Bruce

Lee-Boot effect house females given species together no males,
start displaying longer, called estrus cycles, many species, don't

days variant thereof. interesting phenomenon means
presence male changing ovulation cycle. Now, many people
there, imagine mostly people ovulating will say, "Of course,
notice ovulate differently, "or cycle changes presence partner
"or not," pheromone effect mirrors Lee-Boot effect humans still

can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,

honest upfront that. thus far terms talking optimizing hormones

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone
background menstrual cycle really going disrupt way things interact,
just exquisite feedback loop, not saying don't that,
definitely want aware doing, blood draws one way
that, monitoring cycles ovulating females another way that, males,
good window going testosterone, DHT, aromatase,

want emphasize hear sex steroids steroid hormones, people
think anabolic steroids, course, anabolic steroids derivatives
testosterone testosterone itself, heavily used abused sports
community well outside sports community, there, course, many
steroids not anabolic steroids also abused sports. Today, not
talking drugs sports, think carries heavy weight people
hear word steroids, think anabolic steroids, today's discussion
will certainly relevant physical performance, fact, going talk
specific types exercise, particular patterns cold exposure, well particular
patterns, believe not, breathing can impact sex steroid hormones, estrogen
testosterone, discussion isn't really geared towards performance enhancement
sport, although will entire episode, perhaps even entire month related
performance enhancement physical enterprises. one first things
understand want optimize hormones come from.
lot different glands body produce hormones, pineal gland,
hormones made hypothalamus, hormones made gonads,
ovaries testes, got thyroid gland, bunch different glands
make different hormones, talking sex steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone, major sources ovaries estrogen
testes testosterone, although adrenals can also make testosterone. Now,
also enzymes, enzymes things can change chemical
composition, enzymes going talk today aromatases
mainly, aromatases convert testosterone estrogen, male, instance,
high testosterone, going converted estrogen
aromatase, aromatase made body fat, also made testes themselves,


lot people don't realize this, testes actually capacity manufacture
estrogen aromatase, albeit low levels, turns important
optimizing hormone levels males later points, discuss that. important
note huge range terms levels hormones, testosterone
estrogen, individuals, actually occurs within individuals across
lifespan, not going throw specific numbers X picograms per deciliter, et
cetera today going vary lot, going depend whether not
measuring picograms nanograms sort thing, want
examine hormones, conjunction medical doctor, ideally,
endocrinologist can help sort information, important thing know
prepubescent females make little estrogen, talk
estrogen, mainly talk estradiol, active form estrogen
males females. prepubescent females, low levels estrogen,
puberty, levels estrogen, AKA estradiol, basically skyrocket, across
lifespan, estrogen going vary depending stage menstrual cycle,
one heads menopause, typically takes place nowadays somewhere
age 45 60, levels estrogen going drop post-menopause levels
estrogen low. well, testosterone will fluctuate across lifespan,
testosterone going relatively low prepuberty males, puberty, going
skyrocket, current numbers drops off rate 1% per
year, although going talk data show actually
tremendous variation testosterone levels, actually lot examples men
90s, 90s, still testosterone levels mimic pubertal levels,
remarkable speaks huge variation testosterone levels across individuals.
talk sources hormones, will make clear

mentioned briefly, adrenals, adrenals right top kidneys,
release steroid hormones adrenals,

00:15:46 Power Competition, Plus: Anxiety, Persistence & Dopamine

particular testosterone related derivatives, mainly activated
competition, talk competition turns competition


powerful influence sex steroid hormones, sex steroid hormones
powerfully influence competition. people don't realize this, males
given mammalian species never get reproduce, fact, never even get
sex all, don't often think that, testosterone plays powerful role
determining members given species will get reproduce, ones
species will actually get access females, not talking humans
specifically, well known species like elephant seals, species like antlered
animals rams, instance, higher levels testosterone correlate
access females. Now, one interpretation females detecting
males high testosterone selecting them, receptive them,
going talk receptivity mating moment, actually
males higher testosterone forage will fight harder females,
really interesting good evidence now testosterone
can reduce anxiety, promote novelty-seeking, promote competitive interactions,
leap far mind think human
behaviors, just stay little bit biology makes
make sense turns pretty simple. brain region called
amygdala, Latin, just means almond, amygdala famous role
fear, hear lot fear amygdala, amygdala really
involved threat detection, sets thresholds anxiety consider scary
much, testosterone secreted gonads elsewhere body binds
amygdala changes threshold stress, said previous
versions podcast podcasts testosterone incredible
effect making effort feel good, really referring fact
testosterone lowers stress anxiety, particular, males given species. Now,
important often think testosterone creating, whatever,
masculinization it's, know, virilization, terms thrown around,
really comes mate choice competition?
reducing threshold anxiety, so, selects individuals given
species push further, willing suffer more, although also reduces pain,
maybe also suffer less, pursuit reproduction females. Now, well known
humans males females elevated levels testosterone will
engage novelty-seeking, want point even individuals without
testes testosterone, peaks testosterone similar effects regardless


whether not someone ovaries testes, testosterone increases generally lead
foraging, novelty-seeking, increases libido, increases desire
mate, case increases testosterone promote competitive foraging-
type behaviors humans nonhuman mammals, also true competition
can increase androgens, testosterone, want repeat that, competitive
environments can increase testosterone. Now, people come
conclusion win, testosterone goes up, lose,
testosterone goes down, extent, true, not direct effect
gonads, actually mediated neuromodulator dopamine, talked
dopamine episode motivation drive, dopamine testosterone
remarkable interplay body, dopamine actually released brain ways
pituitary, gland sits roof mouth, release certain
hormones go promote release testosterone, indeed,
winning promotes dopamine, later, testosterone, however, short
term, just competing increases testosterone independent whether not win
lose, short version competition increases testosterone, may
ancient mechanism whereby androgens, testosterone, feeding
back encourage competitive-type behaviors every species, whether
not talking reproduction resource allocation, involved
competition, not every individual species gets access number mates
quality mates,

00:20:58 Testosterone & Libido Pre-Ovulation

true directions, males females everything between.
just want emphasize case went quickly increases
testosterone females also going lead increase reproductive behavior
seeking reproductive behavior, increase libido, fact, particular phase
menstrual cycle testosterone peaks just ovulation that, average,
leads female humans seek sex otherwise cycle,
self-report, also measuring things like testosterone-
estrogen ratios, forth, really interesting single molecule, regardless
chromosomal gonadal background, increasing seeking mates across
individuals,



00:21:48 Estrogen & Sexual Receptivity; Libido Males

increasing desire compete willingness compete, lowering threshold
stress anxiety. important point increases testosterone
promote seeking mates reproduction males females, females,
actually increases estrogen promote receptivity mating, testosterone
driving seeking sex estrogen promoting actual act sex females,
so-called receptivity, consensual receptivity. males, interesting point
testosterone promoting seeking sex, also estrogen males important
libido, estrogen levels brought low, men will completely lose
libido, often not discussed overlooked discussion testosterone
therapy performance-enhancing drugs, people think hyperandrogenized
individuals, meaning people high levels androgen will high
levels libido, will, provided estrogen available sufficient ratios match
testosterone, not simply case high levels testosterone produce lot
sex mating behavior low levels estrogen good across board,
actually need males females, just females, testosterone
levels always going lower estrogen levels,

00:23:10 Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence

males, estrogen levels always going lower testosterone levels,
testosterone promotes sex-seeking behavior, real question is, sex
promote testosterone? answer somewhat complicated, short
version yes, recall, sex multiple stages, physical act
sex, seeking sex, orgasm ejaculation. Now,
important distinguish whether not sex increases
testosterone depends whether not male ejaculates, important
understand previous episode, mentioned dopamine increases
sexual activity, remember, dopamine testosterone tend increase linearly
one another, ejaculation, release prolactin, prolactin
actually sets refractory period males can't sex again,
duration refractory period will vary tremendously depending much


long prolactin release occurs. also described previous episode
people take vitamin B6, not suggesting anyone this, take vitamin B6 order
reduce prolactin levels thereby reduce duration refractory period,
getting question testosterone sexual behavior, important
distinguish different phases reproduction reproductive behaviors,
studies showing sexual behavior can increase testosterone,
study published 2011 Escasa et al., E-S-C-A-S-A, stuff
textbooks, PubMed, quality studies, showing men observe
sex, guess observing pornography, will slight increases
testosterone observation, people actually willing blood
draws taken watching pornography, increases testosterone
modest, 10%, whereas people participated sex, actually
study people blood draws real sex partners,
70% increases testosterone, increases testosterone
quite significant physical act sex far less observing sex.
Now, question often get, fact, one questions get often
comments YouTube, don't know is, whether not ejaculation adjusts
testosterone levels, turns out, two studies find
quality studies PubMed address this, sex ejaculation not
reduce testosterone levels although will increase prolactin levels reasons
described moment ago, however, abstinence sex without ejaculation week
will increase testosterone levels 400%, answer actually
complicated, not straightforward, means sex increases
testosterone, however, abstinence also increases testosterone even further,
nuanced answer, hope satisfactory, no pun intended,
asking me, relationship sex ejaculation
testosterone dopamine? nuanced, understand nuance
want understand certain behaviors impact hormones

00:26:46 Testosterone & Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs Pair Bonding

hormones impact behaviors. mentioned before, females,
testosterone also primes motivation seek sex, sex also increases
testosterone, also increases prolactin, men women, sex increases


prolactin post-sex, just way system works, testosterone
dopamine increase seeking-out behavior sex, sex,
prolactin levels go up, kind quiescence, whole nervous system
promoted towards calm, may actually something pair-bonding
encouragement individuals spend time together exchange different
smells hormones,

00:27:30 DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): Effects Levels/Ratios

maybe even pheromones, going talk pheromones moment.
years ago, lot excitement hormone DHEA,
mainly made adrenals, DHEA promoted kind catch-all
increasing testosterone estrogen males females, indeed, DHEA will
increase testosterone estrogen, something mindful
thinking taking DHEA taking DHEA already. DHEA will increase
testosterone estrogen, extent increases one will
depend whether not starting off estrogen testosterone
whether not starting off testosterone estrogen whether
not lot aromatase, individuals lot aromatase
made testes body fat, take DHEA, good chance fair
portion going shuttled towards estrogen production not towards
testosterone production, whereas individuals low levels testosterone
begin with, high levels estrogen, good chance DHEA going
promote mainly estrogen production, least find research
studies examined. way think DHEA, kind global promoter
sex steroid hormones, specific effects going depend

00:28:45 Behaviors Decrease Testosterone (& Cortisol): Parenting & Prolactin

little bit started whether not ovaries testes. just
behaviors can increase testosterone, behaviors can
decrease testosterone, one well-characterized ones humans
becoming parent. expecting fathers almost 50% decrease testosterone
levels, free bound testosterone, well, cortisol levels, stress hormone,


drop almost three-fold, incredible, estradiol levels double,
estrogen levels double, expecting fathers many people known put additional
body weight, everyone always thought eating parallel
pregnant wife, turns effects reduced testosterone, increased
estradiol, reduced cortisol can explained increase prolactin, not
just humans, species well, male female species
expecting young, lay body fat, assumption
prepare long nights no sleep, occurs many species, not just humans,
really interesting hormone, prolactin, can start suppressing whole categories
hormones, sex steroid hormones, can start increasing whole categories
ones, hear dad bod, lot explanations dad bod
extend well beyond podcast episode, well-known phenomenon
testosterone going drop, prolactin's going increase, estradiol's going increase
males females expecting children. Now, long lasts
interesting, actually much contact much contact
smells baby, offspring, father happens have, available
unavailable will actually impact level hormones, now, definitely not
promoting idea fathers mothers take time away offspring order
keep testosterone levels high restore them, not saying all,
just interesting point evolutionary mechanisms push us toward bias
us toward particular categories behaviors influencing hormones,
feed back promote particular behavior mentioned before,
peaks testosterone males females cause individuals seek sex, not promote
parenting, whereas reductions testosterone, increases prolactin, decreases
cortisol

00:31:24 Illness Impacts Testosterone & Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6

move individuals sexes toward parenting behavior less toward reproductive
behavior. behavior markedly reduces testosterone males
females markedly reduces desire seeking sex sex illness,
many might say, "Well, duh, people feel sick, "they don't feel like seeking
mates, "they don't feel like sex," ever wondered
actually is? Well, turns can explained release called


inflammatory cytokines, cytokines related immune system, travel
lymph blood, attack invader cells like bacteria viruses,
conditions illness, make lot different cytokines, anti-
inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, best-known example
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, known IL-6, injected individuals,
will decrease desire sex eventually will reduce levels testosterone
estrogen independent feeling lousy, reason people don't want sex
sick levels IL-6 increased. Now, important
start think different ways modulate sex steroid hormones, so-
called optimize hormones, keeping levels IL-6 low going important
exert effects, now, IL-6 doesn't just travel gonads shut
gonads, actually ways interact receptors steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone, bind to, impact receptors
sex steroid hormones can't effect. short put simply, inflammatory
cytokines like IL-6 bad sex steroid hormones, going talk
modulate IL-6 direction want increase another
cytokine called IL-10, anti-inflammatory ways can help promote,
least support,

00:33:20 Exactly Behaviors Change Hormones?

sex steroid hormones. move forward, going now start consider
sorts behavioral practices, well things, can modulate sex steroid
hormones directions want go, that, order
set stage that, asking yourself, it, it,
mechanistic level, behaviors can modulate hormones all? think it,
kind strange just mere act parent parenting can change
testosterone levels dramatically estradiol levels dramatically, it?
sweat baby? saliva? sight baby? holding baby,
things? turns many effects smell,
cases, even possibly pheromones. Now, talked hormones,

Recognition



hormones, again, chemical, travels body, impacts tissues cells
elsewhere body, pheromone chemical released one member
species goes impacts members elsewhere, species, even
species. Now, pheromone effects absolutely well-established lots animal
species, controversial humans. Today, going talk
well-established ones animals, mentioned one two
previous podcasts, haven't mentioned several them, going talk
evidence pheromones humans well-established. main ones
animals discussed called Lee-Boot effect, Whitten effect, Bruce
effect, Vandenbergh effect, named people discovered them.
Lee-Boot effect house females given species together no males,
start displaying longer, called estrus cycles, many species, don't
menstrual cycles, 28 days, estrus cycles tend four
days variant thereof. interesting phenomenon means
presence male changing ovulation cycle. Now, many people
there, imagine mostly people ovulating will say, "Of course,
notice ovulate differently, "or cycle changes presence partner
"or not," pheromone effect mirrors Lee-Boot effect humans still
not really identified, nobody knows exact chemical is, nonetheless,
strong effect animals. one Bruce effect,

can go PubMed, can't pronounce last name, sorry, looks like
Wrzosek, W-R-Z-O-S-E-K, hope didn't butcher badly, Wrzosek et al.
2020 "Endocrinology Metabolism Review," recent paper good,

reduced whatever reason.

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing
hormone neurons, neurons within hypothalamus communicate
pituitary, fact, people take large amounts opioids, even take low levels
opioids long periods time, will develop sorts endocrine syndromes,
shown again, gynecomastia, male breast development males,

testosterone estrogen release.

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone

00:15:46 Power Competition, Plus: Anxiety, Persistence & Dopamine

particular testosterone related derivatives, mainly activated
competition, talk competition turns competition


powerful influence sex steroid hormones, sex steroid hormones
powerfully influence competition. people don't realize this, males
given mammalian species never get reproduce, fact, never even get
sex all, don't often think that, testosterone plays powerful role
determining members given species will get reproduce, ones
species will actually get access females, not talking humans
specifically, well known species like elephant seals, species like antlered
animals rams, instance, higher levels testosterone correlate
access females. Now, one interpretation females detecting
males high testosterone selecting them, receptive them,
going talk receptivity mating moment, actually
males higher testosterone forage will fight harder females,
really interesting good evidence now testosterone
can reduce anxiety, promote novelty-seeking, promote competitive interactions,
leap far mind think human
behaviors, just stay little bit biology makes
make sense turns pretty simple. brain region called
amygdala, Latin, just means almond, amygdala famous role
fear, hear lot fear amygdala, amygdala really
involved threat detection, sets thresholds anxiety consider scary
much, testosterone secreted gonads elsewhere body binds
amygdala changes threshold stress, said previous
versions podcast podcasts testosterone incredible
effect making effort feel good, really referring fact
testosterone lowers stress anxiety, particular, males given species. Now,
important often think testosterone creating, whatever,
masculinization it's, know, virilization, terms thrown around,
really comes mate choice competition?
reducing threshold anxiety, so, selects individuals given
species push further, willing suffer more, although also reduces pain,
maybe also suffer less, pursuit reproduction females. Now, well known
humans males females elevated levels testosterone will
engage novelty-seeking, want point even individuals without
testes testosterone, peaks testosterone similar effects regardless


whether not someone ovaries testes, testosterone increases generally lead
foraging, novelty-seeking, increases libido, increases desire
mate, case increases testosterone promote competitive foraging-
type behaviors humans nonhuman mammals, also true competition
can increase androgens, testosterone, want repeat that, competitive

00:21:48 Estrogen & Sexual Receptivity; Libido Males

increasing desire compete willingness compete, lowering threshold
stress anxiety. important point increases testosterone
promote seeking mates reproduction males females, females,
actually increases estrogen promote receptivity mating, testosterone
driving seeking sex estrogen promoting actual act sex females,
so-called receptivity, consensual receptivity. males, interesting point
testosterone promoting seeking sex, also estrogen males important
libido, estrogen levels brought low, men will completely lose
libido, often not discussed overlooked discussion testosterone
therapy performance-enhancing drugs, people think hyperandrogenized
individuals, meaning people high levels androgen will high
levels libido, will, provided estrogen available sufficient ratios match
testosterone, not simply case high levels testosterone produce lot
sex mating behavior low levels estrogen good across board,
actually need males females, just females, testosterone
levels always going lower estrogen levels,

00:23:10 Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence

males, estrogen levels always going lower testosterone levels,
testosterone promotes sex-seeking behavior, real question is, sex
promote testosterone? answer somewhat complicated, short
version yes, recall, sex multiple stages, physical act
sex, seeking sex, orgasm ejaculation. Now,
important distinguish whether not sex increases
testosterone depends whether not male ejaculates, important
understand previous episode, mentioned dopamine increases
sexual activity, remember, dopamine testosterone tend increase linearly
one another, ejaculation, release prolactin, prolactin
actually sets refractory period males can't sex again,
duration refractory period will vary tremendously depending much


long prolactin release occurs. also described previous episode
people take vitamin B6, not suggesting anyone this, take vitamin B6 order
reduce prolactin levels thereby reduce duration refractory period,
getting question testosterone sexual behavior, important
distinguish different phases reproduction reproductive behaviors,
studies showing sexual behavior can increase testosterone,
study published 2011 Escasa et al., E-S-C-A-S-A, stuff
textbooks, PubMed, quality studies, showing men observe
sex, guess observing pornography, will slight increases
testosterone observation, people actually willing blood
draws taken watching pornography, increases testosterone
modest, 10%, whereas people participated sex, actually
study people blood draws real sex partners,
70% increases testosterone, increases testosterone
quite significant physical act sex far less observing sex.
Now, question often get, fact, one questions get often
comments YouTube, don't know is, whether not ejaculation adjusts
testosterone levels, turns out, two studies find
quality studies PubMed address this, sex ejaculation not
reduce testosterone levels although will increase prolactin levels reasons
described moment ago, however, abstinence sex without ejaculation week
will increase testosterone levels 400%, answer actually
complicated, not straightforward, means sex increases
testosterone, however, abstinence also increases testosterone even further,
nuanced answer, hope satisfactory, no pun intended,
asking me, relationship sex ejaculation
testosterone dopamine? nuanced, understand nuance
want understand certain behaviors impact hormones

00:26:46 Testosterone & Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs Pair Bonding

hormones impact behaviors. mentioned before, females,
testosterone also primes motivation seek sex, sex also increases
testosterone, also increases prolactin, men women, sex increases


prolactin post-sex, just way system works, testosterone
dopamine increase seeking-out behavior sex, sex,
prolactin levels go up, kind quiescence, whole nervous system
promoted towards calm, may actually something pair-bonding
encouragement individuals spend time together exchange different
smells hormones,

00:27:30 DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): Effects Levels/Ratios

maybe even pheromones, going talk pheromones moment.
years ago, lot excitement hormone DHEA,
mainly made adrenals, DHEA promoted kind catch-all
increasing testosterone estrogen males females, indeed, DHEA will
increase testosterone estrogen, something mindful
thinking taking DHEA taking DHEA already. DHEA will increase
testosterone estrogen, extent increases one will
depend whether not starting off estrogen testosterone
whether not starting off testosterone estrogen whether
not lot aromatase, individuals lot aromatase
made testes body fat, take DHEA, good chance fair
portion going shuttled towards estrogen production not towards
testosterone production, whereas individuals low levels testosterone
begin with, high levels estrogen, good chance DHEA going
promote mainly estrogen production, least find research
studies examined. way think DHEA, kind global promoter
sex steroid hormones, specific effects going depend

00:28:45 Behaviors Decrease Testosterone (& Cortisol): Parenting & Prolactin

little bit started whether not ovaries testes. just
behaviors can increase testosterone, behaviors can
decrease testosterone, one well-characterized ones humans
becoming parent. expecting fathers almost 50% decrease testosterone
levels, free bound testosterone, well, cortisol levels, stress hormone,


drop almost three-fold, incredible, estradiol levels double,
estrogen levels double, expecting fathers many people known put additional
body weight, everyone always thought eating parallel
pregnant wife, turns effects reduced testosterone, increased
estradiol, reduced cortisol can explained increase prolactin, not
just humans, species well, male female species
expecting young, lay body fat, assumption
prepare long nights no sleep, occurs many species, not just humans,
really interesting hormone, prolactin, can start suppressing whole categories
hormones, sex steroid hormones, can start increasing whole categories
ones, hear dad bod, lot explanations dad bod
extend well beyond podcast episode, well-known phenomenon
testosterone going drop, prolactin's going increase, estradiol's going increase
males females expecting children. Now, long lasts
interesting, actually much contact much contact
smells baby, offspring, father happens have, available
unavailable will actually impact level hormones, now, definitely not
promoting idea fathers mothers take time away offspring order
keep testosterone levels high restore them, not saying all,
just interesting point evolutionary mechanisms push us toward bias
us toward particular categories behaviors influencing hormones,
feed back promote particular behavior mentioned before,
peaks testosterone males females cause individuals seek sex, not promote
parenting, whereas reductions testosterone, increases prolactin, decreases
cortisol

00:31:24 Illness Impacts Testosterone & Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6

move individuals sexes toward parenting behavior less toward reproductive
behavior. behavior markedly reduces testosterone males
females markedly reduces desire seeking sex sex illness,
many might say, "Well, duh, people feel sick, "they don't feel like seeking
mates, "they don't feel like sex," ever wondered
actually is? Well, turns can explained release called


inflammatory cytokines, cytokines related immune system, travel
lymph blood, attack invader cells like bacteria viruses,
conditions illness, make lot different cytokines, anti-
inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, best-known example
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, known IL-6, injected individuals,
will decrease desire sex eventually will reduce levels testosterone
estrogen independent feeling lousy, reason people don't want sex
sick levels IL-6 increased. Now, important
start think different ways modulate sex steroid hormones, so-
called optimize hormones, keeping levels IL-6 low going important
exert effects, now, IL-6 doesn't just travel gonads shut
gonads, actually ways interact receptors steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone, bind to, impact receptors
sex steroid hormones can't effect. short put simply, inflammatory
cytokines like IL-6 bad sex steroid hormones, going talk
modulate IL-6 direction want increase another
cytokine called IL-10, anti-inflammatory ways can help promote,
least support,

00:33:20 Exactly Behaviors Change Hormones?

sex steroid hormones. move forward, going now start consider
sorts behavioral practices, well things, can modulate sex steroid
hormones directions want go, that, order
set stage that, asking yourself, it, it,
mechanistic level, behaviors can modulate hormones all? think it,
kind strange just mere act parent parenting can change
testosterone levels dramatically estradiol levels dramatically, it?
sweat baby? saliva? sight baby? holding baby,
things? turns many effects smell,
cases, even possibly pheromones. Now, talked hormones,

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels

low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject

testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone

powerful influence sex steroid hormones, sex steroid hormones
powerfully influence competition. people don't realize this, males
given mammalian species never get reproduce, fact, never even get
sex all, don't often think that, testosterone plays powerful role
determining members given species will get reproduce, ones
species will actually get access females, not talking humans
specifically, well known species like elephant seals, species like antlered
animals rams, instance, higher levels testosterone correlate
access females. Now, one interpretation females detecting
males high testosterone selecting them, receptive them,
going talk receptivity mating moment, actually
males higher testosterone forage will fight harder females,
really interesting good evidence now testosterone
can reduce anxiety, promote novelty-seeking, promote competitive interactions,
leap far mind think human
behaviors, just stay little bit biology makes
make sense turns pretty simple. brain region called
amygdala, Latin, just means almond, amygdala famous role
fear, hear lot fear amygdala, amygdala really
involved threat detection, sets thresholds anxiety consider scary
much, testosterone secreted gonads elsewhere body binds
amygdala changes threshold stress, said previous
versions podcast podcasts testosterone incredible
effect making effort feel good, really referring fact
testosterone lowers stress anxiety, particular, males given species. Now,
important often think testosterone creating, whatever,
masculinization it's, know, virilization, terms thrown around,
really comes mate choice competition?
reducing threshold anxiety, so, selects individuals given
species push further, willing suffer more, although also reduces pain,
maybe also suffer less, pursuit reproduction females. Now, well known
humans males females elevated levels testosterone will
engage novelty-seeking, want point even individuals without
testes testosterone, peaks testosterone similar effects regardless


whether not someone ovaries testes, testosterone increases generally lead
foraging, novelty-seeking, increases libido, increases desire
mate, case increases testosterone promote competitive foraging-
type behaviors humans nonhuman mammals, also true competition
can increase androgens, testosterone, want repeat that, competitive
environments can increase testosterone. Now, people come
conclusion win, testosterone goes up, lose,
testosterone goes down, extent, true, not direct effect
gonads, actually mediated neuromodulator dopamine, talked
dopamine episode motivation drive, dopamine testosterone
remarkable interplay body, dopamine actually released brain ways
pituitary, gland sits roof mouth, release certain
hormones go promote release testosterone, indeed,
winning promotes dopamine, later, testosterone, however, short
term, just competing increases testosterone independent whether not win
lose, short version competition increases testosterone, may
ancient mechanism whereby androgens, testosterone, feeding

not talking reproduction resource allocation, involved
competition, not every individual species gets access number mates
quality mates,

00:20:58 Testosterone & Libido Pre-Ovulation

true directions, males females everything between.
just want emphasize case went quickly increases
testosterone females also going lead increase reproductive behavior
seeking reproductive behavior, increase libido, fact, particular phase
menstrual cycle testosterone peaks just ovulation that, average,
leads female humans seek sex otherwise cycle,
self-report, also measuring things like testosterone-
estrogen ratios, forth, really interesting single molecule, regardless
chromosomal gonadal background, increasing seeking mates across
individuals,



00:21:48 Estrogen & Sexual Receptivity; Libido Males

increasing desire compete willingness compete, lowering threshold
stress anxiety. important point increases testosterone
promote seeking mates reproduction males females, females,
actually increases estrogen promote receptivity mating, testosterone
driving seeking sex estrogen promoting actual act sex females,
so-called receptivity, consensual receptivity. males, interesting point
testosterone promoting seeking sex, also estrogen males important
libido, estrogen levels brought low, men will completely lose
libido, often not discussed overlooked discussion testosterone
therapy performance-enhancing drugs, people think hyperandrogenized
individuals, meaning people high levels androgen will high
levels libido, will, provided estrogen available sufficient ratios match
testosterone, not simply case high levels testosterone produce lot
sex mating behavior low levels estrogen good across board,
actually need males females, just females, testosterone
levels always going lower estrogen levels,

00:23:10 Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence

males, estrogen levels always going lower testosterone levels,
testosterone promotes sex-seeking behavior, real question is, sex
promote testosterone? answer somewhat complicated, short
version yes, recall, sex multiple stages, physical act
sex, seeking sex, orgasm ejaculation. Now,
important distinguish whether not sex increases
testosterone depends whether not male ejaculates, important
understand previous episode, mentioned dopamine increases
sexual activity, remember, dopamine testosterone tend increase linearly
one another, ejaculation, release prolactin, prolactin
actually sets refractory period males can't sex again,
duration refractory period will vary tremendously depending much


long prolactin release occurs. also described previous episode
people take vitamin B6, not suggesting anyone this, take vitamin B6 order
reduce prolactin levels thereby reduce duration refractory period,
getting question testosterone sexual behavior, important
distinguish different phases reproduction reproductive behaviors,
studies showing sexual behavior can increase testosterone,
study published 2011 Escasa et al., E-S-C-A-S-A, stuff
textbooks, PubMed, quality studies, showing men observe
sex, guess observing pornography, will slight increases
testosterone observation, people actually willing blood
draws taken watching pornography, increases testosterone
modest, 10%, whereas people participated sex, actually
study people blood draws real sex partners,
70% increases testosterone, increases testosterone
quite significant physical act sex far less observing sex.
Now, question often get, fact, one questions get often
comments YouTube, don't know is, whether not ejaculation adjusts
testosterone levels, turns out, two studies find
quality studies PubMed address this, sex ejaculation not
reduce testosterone levels although will increase prolactin levels reasons
described moment ago, however, abstinence sex without ejaculation week
will increase testosterone levels 400%, answer actually
complicated, not straightforward, means sex increases
testosterone, however, abstinence also increases testosterone even further,
nuanced answer, hope satisfactory, no pun intended,
asking me, relationship sex ejaculation
testosterone dopamine? nuanced, understand nuance
want understand certain behaviors impact hormones

00:26:46 Testosterone & Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs Pair Bonding

hormones impact behaviors. mentioned before, females,
testosterone also primes motivation seek sex, sex also increases
testosterone, also increases prolactin, men women, sex increases


prolactin post-sex, just way system works, testosterone
dopamine increase seeking-out behavior sex, sex,
prolactin levels go up, kind quiescence, whole nervous system
promoted towards calm, may actually something pair-bonding
encouragement individuals spend time together exchange different
smells hormones,

00:27:30 DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): Effects Levels/Ratios

maybe even pheromones, going talk pheromones moment.
years ago, lot excitement hormone DHEA,
mainly made adrenals, DHEA promoted kind catch-all
increasing testosterone estrogen males females, indeed, DHEA will
increase testosterone estrogen, something mindful
thinking taking DHEA taking DHEA already. DHEA will increase
testosterone estrogen, extent increases one will
depend whether not starting off estrogen testosterone
whether not starting off testosterone estrogen whether
not lot aromatase, individuals lot aromatase
made testes body fat, take DHEA, good chance fair
portion going shuttled towards estrogen production not towards
testosterone production, whereas individuals low levels testosterone
begin with, high levels estrogen, good chance DHEA going
promote mainly estrogen production, least find research
studies examined. way think DHEA, kind global promoter
sex steroid hormones, specific effects going depend

00:28:45 Behaviors Decrease Testosterone (& Cortisol): Parenting & Prolactin

little bit started whether not ovaries testes. just
behaviors can increase testosterone, behaviors can
decrease testosterone, one well-characterized ones humans
becoming parent. expecting fathers almost 50% decrease testosterone
levels, free bound testosterone, well, cortisol levels, stress hormone,


drop almost three-fold, incredible, estradiol levels double,
estrogen levels double, expecting fathers many people known put additional
body weight, everyone always thought eating parallel
pregnant wife, turns effects reduced testosterone, increased
estradiol, reduced cortisol can explained increase prolactin, not
just humans, species well, male female species
expecting young, lay body fat, assumption
prepare long nights no sleep, occurs many species, not just humans,
really interesting hormone, prolactin, can start suppressing whole categories
hormones, sex steroid hormones, can start increasing whole categories
ones, hear dad bod, lot explanations dad bod
extend well beyond podcast episode, well-known phenomenon
testosterone going drop, prolactin's going increase, estradiol's going increase
males females expecting children. Now, long lasts
interesting, actually much contact much contact
smells baby, offspring, father happens have, available
unavailable will actually impact level hormones, now, definitely not
promoting idea fathers mothers take time away offspring order
keep testosterone levels high restore them, not saying all,
just interesting point evolutionary mechanisms push us toward bias
us toward particular categories behaviors influencing hormones,
feed back promote particular behavior mentioned before,
peaks testosterone males females cause individuals seek sex, not promote
parenting, whereas reductions testosterone, increases prolactin, decreases
cortisol

00:31:24 Illness Impacts Testosterone & Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6

move individuals sexes toward parenting behavior less toward reproductive
behavior. behavior markedly reduces testosterone males
females markedly reduces desire seeking sex sex illness,
many might say, "Well, duh, people feel sick, "they don't feel like seeking
mates, "they don't feel like sex," ever wondered
actually is? Well, turns can explained release called


inflammatory cytokines, cytokines related immune system, travel
lymph blood, attack invader cells like bacteria viruses,
conditions illness, make lot different cytokines, anti-
inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, best-known example
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, known IL-6, injected individuals,
will decrease desire sex eventually will reduce levels testosterone
estrogen independent feeling lousy, reason people don't want sex
sick levels IL-6 increased. Now, important
start think different ways modulate sex steroid hormones, so-
called optimize hormones, keeping levels IL-6 low going important
exert effects, now, IL-6 doesn't just travel gonads shut
gonads, actually ways interact receptors steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone, bind to, impact receptors
sex steroid hormones can't effect. short put simply, inflammatory
cytokines like IL-6 bad sex steroid hormones, going talk
modulate IL-6 direction want increase another
cytokine called IL-10, anti-inflammatory ways can help promote,
least support,

00:33:20 Exactly Behaviors Change Hormones?

sex steroid hormones. move forward, going now start consider
sorts behavioral practices, well things, can modulate sex steroid
hormones directions want go, that, order
set stage that, asking yourself, it, it,
mechanistic level, behaviors can modulate hormones all? think it,
kind strange just mere act parent parenting can change
testosterone levels dramatically estradiol levels dramatically, it?
sweat baby? saliva? sight baby? holding baby,
things? turns many effects smell,
cases, even possibly pheromones. Now, talked hormones,

hormones, again, chemical, travels body, impacts tissues cells
elsewhere body, pheromone chemical released one member
species goes impacts members elsewhere, species, even
species. Now, pheromone effects absolutely well-established lots animal
species, controversial humans. Today, going talk
well-established ones animals, mentioned one two
previous podcasts, haven't mentioned several them, going talk
evidence pheromones humans well-established. main ones
animals discussed called Lee-Boot effect, Whitten effect, Bruce

Lee-Boot effect house females given species together no males,
start displaying longer, called estrus cycles, many species, don't
menstrual cycles, 28 days, estrus cycles tend four
days variant thereof. interesting phenomenon means
presence male changing ovulation cycle. Now, many people
there, imagine mostly people ovulating will say, "Of course,
notice ovulate differently, "or cycle changes presence partner
"or not," pheromone effect mirrors Lee-Boot effect humans still

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing
hormone neurons, neurons within hypothalamus communicate
pituitary, fact, people take large amounts opioids, even take low levels
opioids long periods time, will develop sorts endocrine syndromes,
shown again, gynecomastia, male breast development males,

testosterone estrogen release.

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone

low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone

actually increases estrogen promote receptivity mating, testosterone
driving seeking sex estrogen promoting actual act sex females,
so-called receptivity, consensual receptivity. males, interesting point

00:23:10 Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence

males, estrogen levels always going lower testosterone levels,
testosterone promotes sex-seeking behavior, real question is, sex
promote testosterone? answer somewhat complicated, short
version yes, recall, sex multiple stages, physical act
sex, seeking sex, orgasm ejaculation. Now,
important distinguish whether not sex increases
testosterone depends whether not male ejaculates, important
understand previous episode, mentioned dopamine increases
sexual activity, remember, dopamine testosterone tend increase linearly
one another, ejaculation, release prolactin, prolactin
actually sets refractory period males can't sex again,
duration refractory period will vary tremendously depending much


long prolactin release occurs. also described previous episode
people take vitamin B6, not suggesting anyone this, take vitamin B6 order
reduce prolactin levels thereby reduce duration refractory period,
getting question testosterone sexual behavior, important
distinguish different phases reproduction reproductive behaviors,
studies showing sexual behavior can increase testosterone,
study published 2011 Escasa et al., E-S-C-A-S-A, stuff
textbooks, PubMed, quality studies, showing men observe
sex, guess observing pornography, will slight increases
testosterone observation, people actually willing blood
draws taken watching pornography, increases testosterone
modest, 10%, whereas people participated sex, actually
study people blood draws real sex partners,
70% increases testosterone, increases testosterone
quite significant physical act sex far less observing sex.
Now, question often get, fact, one questions get often
comments YouTube, don't know is, whether not ejaculation adjusts
testosterone levels, turns out, two studies find
quality studies PubMed address this, sex ejaculation not
reduce testosterone levels although will increase prolactin levels reasons
described moment ago, however, abstinence sex without ejaculation week
will increase testosterone levels 400%, answer actually
complicated, not straightforward, means sex increases
testosterone, however, abstinence also increases testosterone even further,
nuanced answer, hope satisfactory, no pun intended,
asking me, relationship sex ejaculation
testosterone dopamine? nuanced, understand nuance
want understand certain behaviors impact hormones

00:26:46 Testosterone & Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs Pair Bonding

hormones impact behaviors. mentioned before, females,
testosterone also primes motivation seek sex, sex also increases
testosterone, also increases prolactin, men women, sex increases


prolactin post-sex, just way system works, testosterone
dopamine increase seeking-out behavior sex, sex,
prolactin levels go up, kind quiescence, whole nervous system
promoted towards calm, may actually something pair-bonding
encouragement individuals spend time together exchange different

00:27:30 DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): Effects Levels/Ratios

maybe even pheromones, going talk pheromones moment.
years ago, lot excitement hormone DHEA,
mainly made adrenals, DHEA promoted kind catch-all
increasing testosterone estrogen males females, indeed, DHEA will
increase testosterone estrogen, something mindful
thinking taking DHEA taking DHEA already. DHEA will increase
testosterone estrogen, extent increases one will
depend whether not starting off estrogen testosterone
whether not starting off testosterone estrogen whether
not lot aromatase, individuals lot aromatase
made testes body fat, take DHEA, good chance fair
portion going shuttled towards estrogen production not towards
testosterone production, whereas individuals low levels testosterone
begin with, high levels estrogen, good chance DHEA going
promote mainly estrogen production, least find research
studies examined. way think DHEA, kind global promoter
sex steroid hormones, specific effects going depend

00:28:45 Behaviors Decrease Testosterone (& Cortisol): Parenting & Prolactin

little bit started whether not ovaries testes. just
behaviors can increase testosterone, behaviors can
decrease testosterone, one well-characterized ones humans
becoming parent. expecting fathers almost 50% decrease testosterone
levels, free bound testosterone, well, cortisol levels, stress hormone,


drop almost three-fold, incredible, estradiol levels double,
estrogen levels double, expecting fathers many people known put additional
body weight, everyone always thought eating parallel
pregnant wife, turns effects reduced testosterone, increased
estradiol, reduced cortisol can explained increase prolactin, not
just humans, species well, male female species
expecting young, lay body fat, assumption
prepare long nights no sleep, occurs many species, not just humans,
really interesting hormone, prolactin, can start suppressing whole categories
hormones, sex steroid hormones, can start increasing whole categories
ones, hear dad bod, lot explanations dad bod
extend well beyond podcast episode, well-known phenomenon
testosterone going drop, prolactin's going increase, estradiol's going increase
males females expecting children. Now, long lasts
interesting, actually much contact much contact
smells baby, offspring, father happens have, available
unavailable will actually impact level hormones, now, definitely not
promoting idea fathers mothers take time away offspring order
keep testosterone levels high restore them, not saying all,
just interesting point evolutionary mechanisms push us toward bias
us toward particular categories behaviors influencing hormones,
feed back promote particular behavior mentioned before,
peaks testosterone males females cause individuals seek sex, not promote
parenting, whereas reductions testosterone, increases prolactin, decreases
cortisol

00:31:24 Illness Impacts Testosterone & Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6

move individuals sexes toward parenting behavior less toward reproductive
behavior. behavior markedly reduces testosterone males
females markedly reduces desire seeking sex sex illness,
many might say, "Well, duh, people feel sick, "they don't feel like seeking
mates, "they don't feel like sex," ever wondered
actually is? Well, turns can explained release called


inflammatory cytokines, cytokines related immune system, travel
lymph blood, attack invader cells like bacteria viruses,
conditions illness, make lot different cytokines, anti-
inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, best-known example
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, known IL-6, injected individuals,
will decrease desire sex eventually will reduce levels testosterone
estrogen independent feeling lousy, reason people don't want sex
sick levels IL-6 increased. Now, important
start think different ways modulate sex steroid hormones, so-
called optimize hormones, keeping levels IL-6 low going important
exert effects, now, IL-6 doesn't just travel gonads shut
gonads, actually ways interact receptors steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone, bind to, impact receptors
sex steroid hormones can't effect. short put simply, inflammatory
cytokines like IL-6 bad sex steroid hormones, going talk
modulate IL-6 direction want increase another
cytokine called IL-10, anti-inflammatory ways can help promote,
least support,

00:33:20 Exactly Behaviors Change Hormones?

sex steroid hormones. move forward, going now start consider
sorts behavioral practices, well things, can modulate sex steroid
hormones directions want go, that, order
set stage that, asking yourself, it, it,
mechanistic level, behaviors can modulate hormones all? think it,
kind strange just mere act parent parenting can change
testosterone levels dramatically estradiol levels dramatically, it?
sweat baby? saliva? sight baby? holding baby,
things? turns many effects smell,
cases, even possibly pheromones. Now, talked hormones,

hormones, again, chemical, travels body, impacts tissues cells
elsewhere body, pheromone chemical released one member
species goes impacts members elsewhere, species, even

species, controversial humans. Today, going talk
well-established ones animals, mentioned one two
previous podcasts, haven't mentioned several them, going talk
evidence pheromones humans well-established. main ones
animals discussed called Lee-Boot effect, Whitten effect, Bruce

Lee-Boot effect house females given species together no males,
start displaying longer, called estrus cycles, many species, don't

days variant thereof. interesting phenomenon means
presence male changing ovulation cycle. Now, many people
there, imagine mostly people ovulating will say, "Of course,
notice ovulate differently, "or cycle changes presence partner
"or not," pheromone effect mirrors Lee-Boot effect humans still
not really identified, nobody knows exact chemical is, nonetheless,

going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase

episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase

excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase

00:21:48 Estrogen & Sexual Receptivity; Libido Males

increasing desire compete willingness compete, lowering threshold
stress anxiety. important point increases testosterone
promote seeking mates reproduction males females, females,
actually increases estrogen promote receptivity mating, testosterone
driving seeking sex estrogen promoting actual act sex females,
so-called receptivity, consensual receptivity. males, interesting point
testosterone promoting seeking sex, also estrogen males important
libido, estrogen levels brought low, men will completely lose
libido, often not discussed overlooked discussion testosterone
therapy performance-enhancing drugs, people think hyperandrogenized
individuals, meaning people high levels androgen will high
levels libido, will, provided estrogen available sufficient ratios match
testosterone, not simply case high levels testosterone produce lot
sex mating behavior low levels estrogen good across board,
actually need males females, just females, testosterone
levels always going lower estrogen levels,

00:23:10 Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence

males, estrogen levels always going lower testosterone levels,
testosterone promotes sex-seeking behavior, real question is, sex
promote testosterone? answer somewhat complicated, short
version yes, recall, sex multiple stages, physical act
sex, seeking sex, orgasm ejaculation. Now,
important distinguish whether not sex increases
testosterone depends whether not male ejaculates, important
understand previous episode, mentioned dopamine increases
sexual activity, remember, dopamine testosterone tend increase linearly
one another, ejaculation, release prolactin, prolactin
actually sets refractory period males can't sex again,
duration refractory period will vary tremendously depending much


long prolactin release occurs. also described previous episode
people take vitamin B6, not suggesting anyone this, take vitamin B6 order
reduce prolactin levels thereby reduce duration refractory period,
getting question testosterone sexual behavior, important
distinguish different phases reproduction reproductive behaviors,
studies showing sexual behavior can increase testosterone,
study published 2011 Escasa et al., E-S-C-A-S-A, stuff
textbooks, PubMed, quality studies, showing men observe
sex, guess observing pornography, will slight increases
testosterone observation, people actually willing blood
draws taken watching pornography, increases testosterone
modest, 10%, whereas people participated sex, actually
study people blood draws real sex partners,
70% increases testosterone, increases testosterone
quite significant physical act sex far less observing sex.
Now, question often get, fact, one questions get often
comments YouTube, don't know is, whether not ejaculation adjusts
testosterone levels, turns out, two studies find
quality studies PubMed address this, sex ejaculation not
reduce testosterone levels although will increase prolactin levels reasons
described moment ago, however, abstinence sex without ejaculation week
will increase testosterone levels 400%, answer actually
complicated, not straightforward, means sex increases
testosterone, however, abstinence also increases testosterone even further,
nuanced answer, hope satisfactory, no pun intended,
asking me, relationship sex ejaculation
testosterone dopamine? nuanced, understand nuance
want understand certain behaviors impact hormones

00:26:46 Testosterone & Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs Pair Bonding

hormones impact behaviors. mentioned before, females,

increase testosterone estrogen, something mindful
thinking taking DHEA taking DHEA already. DHEA will increase
testosterone estrogen, extent increases one will
depend whether not starting off estrogen testosterone
whether not starting off testosterone estrogen whether
not lot aromatase, individuals lot aromatase
made testes body fat, take DHEA, good chance fair
portion going shuttled towards estrogen production not towards
testosterone production, whereas individuals low levels testosterone
begin with, high levels estrogen, good chance DHEA going

00:28:45 Behaviors Decrease Testosterone (& Cortisol): Parenting & Prolactin

little bit started whether not ovaries testes. just
behaviors can increase testosterone, behaviors can
decrease testosterone, one well-characterized ones humans
becoming parent. expecting fathers almost 50% decrease testosterone
levels, free bound testosterone, well, cortisol levels, stress hormone,


drop almost three-fold, incredible, estradiol levels double,
estrogen levels double, expecting fathers many people known put additional
body weight, everyone always thought eating parallel
pregnant wife, turns effects reduced testosterone, increased
estradiol, reduced cortisol can explained increase prolactin, not
just humans, species well, male female species
expecting young, lay body fat, assumption
prepare long nights no sleep, occurs many species, not just humans,
really interesting hormone, prolactin, can start suppressing whole categories
hormones, sex steroid hormones, can start increasing whole categories
ones, hear dad bod, lot explanations dad bod
extend well beyond podcast episode, well-known phenomenon
testosterone going drop, prolactin's going increase, estradiol's going increase
males females expecting children. Now, long lasts
interesting, actually much contact much contact
smells baby, offspring, father happens have, available
unavailable will actually impact level hormones, now, definitely not
promoting idea fathers mothers take time away offspring order
keep testosterone levels high restore them, not saying all,
just interesting point evolutionary mechanisms push us toward bias
us toward particular categories behaviors influencing hormones,
feed back promote particular behavior mentioned before,
peaks testosterone males females cause individuals seek sex, not promote
parenting, whereas reductions testosterone, increases prolactin, decreases
cortisol

00:31:24 Illness Impacts Testosterone & Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6

move individuals sexes toward parenting behavior less toward reproductive
behavior. behavior markedly reduces testosterone males
females markedly reduces desire seeking sex sex illness,
many might say, "Well, duh, people feel sick, "they don't feel like seeking
mates, "they don't feel like sex," ever wondered
actually is? Well, turns can explained release called


inflammatory cytokines, cytokines related immune system, travel
lymph blood, attack invader cells like bacteria viruses,
conditions illness, make lot different cytokines, anti-
inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, best-known example
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, known IL-6, injected individuals,
will decrease desire sex eventually will reduce levels testosterone
estrogen independent feeling lousy, reason people don't want sex
sick levels IL-6 increased. Now, important
start think different ways modulate sex steroid hormones, so-
called optimize hormones, keeping levels IL-6 low going important
exert effects, now, IL-6 doesn't just travel gonads shut
gonads, actually ways interact receptors steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone, bind to, impact receptors
sex steroid hormones can't effect. short put simply, inflammatory
cytokines like IL-6 bad sex steroid hormones, going talk
modulate IL-6 direction want increase another
cytokine called IL-10, anti-inflammatory ways can help promote,
least support,

00:33:20 Exactly Behaviors Change Hormones?

right, that, get breathing right? Well, people
severe sleep apnea, going need CPAP machine,
machine actually put face helps breathe properly sleep.
Many people, however, starting thing taping mouths shut, now,

endurance work, weight training failure, less intense weight training can impact
testosterone levels, want remind talking testosterone
males females, based know earlier episode,


testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided
optimal range. look web, people will say, "Oh, know,
"testosterone increased weight training, "you want big, heavy
compound movements," squats deadlifts chins things sort,
scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,
squat? squat loading bunch weights bar then, know,
sitting down, essentially, standing again. deadlift?
lifting heavy weights ground. increase testosterone, right?
often not discussed weight training even exercise science
community, actually stimulate release testosterone adrenals

think always genes don't create behavior, immune systems don't know
activated, lungs don't know inhale exhale, hearts don't know beat
except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen

heavy-resistance exercise, find examples that, instance, know,
muscle biopsies, can actually see receptor increases, looking either high-
volume low-volume really intense exercise, can find lot not lot
mechanism nervous system this, reason want
know can potentially build better protocols figure
exactly movements triggering increases androgen receptors
testosterone. interesting start digging mechanistic
studies, find heavy weight training, weight training
sets done anywhere kind one eight rep range, translates
differently depending ratio muscle fiber type forth, basically
people working anywhere like, 70% 95% maximum, sometimes
even going right one-repetition maximum, really kind max effort,
find using nervous system way moving heavy loads,
translate recruitment high-threshold motor units, muscle


physiologists, rule muscle physiology neuron recruitment
moving muscles basically use minimum number motor units neurons
activate muscle possibly can, loads increase, recruit

exercise jockeys going come bunch things where,
oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training
heavy loads, anywhere one-rep maximum somewhere six eight

clearly influence hard work neural level muscular level


increasing testosterone, also clearly effect working hard
presumably increasing cortisol much, although speculating there, terms

solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase

want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something

looking kind people talking about, also
mean scientific literature, one things new me, anyway, probably
not new lot gym rats there, people spend lot time

again, ecdysteroids, ecdysteroids molecules come things like
spinach, believe not, lot similarity cholesterol molecule, one
discussed lot right now something called turkesterone, wish
knew called turkesterone, someone tell called turkesterone,
anything turkeys? don't know called turkesterone, perhaps
someone will know. case, ecdysteroids similar enough cholesterol,
remember, cholesterol precursor testosterone, cortisol, estrogen,
appears ecdysteroids bioavailability, metabolites
bioavailable, something that, many years, people talked whether
not insect hormones hormones species actually used
humans whether not effect all, pretty clear based
study able find, paper came 2019, comparative

talks ecdysteroids given conjunction strength training no
strength training, 10-week intervention, conclusion
ecdysteroids fairly significant, placebo controls, increases muscle mass,
strength, hypertrophy effects, sorts things one expect increases
androgen, conclusion study not conclusion, although may may
not agree them, isn't opinions, just, want clear,
words, not mine, say that, words, quote, "Our results strongly
suggest "the inclusion ecdysteroid "in list prohibited substances."
saying things powerful list banned

cares? whole issue augmenting hormones sports interesting
issue, fact, just want little anecdote that, can't reveal names here,
course, learned recently surprising many athletes
pro sports taking testosterone, able legally not just
available prescription, allowed rules
sport fine print no one, including me, ever seen,

absolutely no question estrogens testosterones modulate gene expression,
modulate strength, modulate way brain works, modulates relationship
effort anxiety, et cetera, talking supplementation, effects
supplementation, say, individuals can quite dramatic,
always, always, always, except extreme cases, going far subtler, excuse me, far
subtle, use proper English, far subtle be, instance, just
injecting testosterone injecting estrogen, et cetera, think just
honest upfront that. thus far terms talking optimizing hormones

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone

just exquisite feedback loop, not saying don't that,
definitely want aware doing, blood draws one way

long prolactin release occurs. also described previous episode
people take vitamin B6, not suggesting anyone this, take vitamin B6 order
reduce prolactin levels thereby reduce duration refractory period,
getting question testosterone sexual behavior, important
distinguish different phases reproduction reproductive behaviors,
studies showing sexual behavior can increase testosterone,
study published 2011 Escasa et al., E-S-C-A-S-A, stuff
textbooks, PubMed, quality studies, showing men observe
sex, guess observing pornography, will slight increases
testosterone observation, people actually willing blood
draws taken watching pornography, increases testosterone
modest, 10%, whereas people participated sex, actually
study people blood draws real sex partners,
70% increases testosterone, increases testosterone
quite significant physical act sex far less observing sex.
Now, question often get, fact, one questions get often
comments YouTube, don't know is, whether not ejaculation adjusts
testosterone levels, turns out, two studies find
quality studies PubMed address this, sex ejaculation not
reduce testosterone levels although will increase prolactin levels reasons
described moment ago, however, abstinence sex without ejaculation week
will increase testosterone levels 400%, answer actually
complicated, not straightforward, means sex increases
testosterone, however, abstinence also increases testosterone even further,
nuanced answer, hope satisfactory, no pun intended,
asking me, relationship sex ejaculation
testosterone dopamine? nuanced, understand nuance
want understand certain behaviors impact hormones

00:28:45 Behaviors Decrease Testosterone (& Cortisol): Parenting & Prolactin

little bit started whether not ovaries testes. just
behaviors can increase testosterone, behaviors can
decrease testosterone, one well-characterized ones humans
becoming parent. expecting fathers almost 50% decrease testosterone
levels, free bound testosterone, well, cortisol levels, stress hormone,


drop almost three-fold, incredible, estradiol levels double,
estrogen levels double, expecting fathers many people known put additional
body weight, everyone always thought eating parallel
pregnant wife, turns effects reduced testosterone, increased
estradiol, reduced cortisol can explained increase prolactin, not
just humans, species well, male female species
expecting young, lay body fat, assumption
prepare long nights no sleep, occurs many species, not just humans,
really interesting hormone, prolactin, can start suppressing whole categories
hormones, sex steroid hormones, can start increasing whole categories
ones, hear dad bod, lot explanations dad bod
extend well beyond podcast episode, well-known phenomenon
testosterone going drop, prolactin's going increase, estradiol's going increase
males females expecting children. Now, long lasts
interesting, actually much contact much contact
smells baby, offspring, father happens have, available
unavailable will actually impact level hormones, now, definitely not
promoting idea fathers mothers take time away offspring order
keep testosterone levels high restore them, not saying all,
just interesting point evolutionary mechanisms push us toward bias
us toward particular categories behaviors influencing hormones,
feed back promote particular behavior mentioned before,
peaks testosterone males females cause individuals seek sex, not promote
parenting, whereas reductions testosterone, increases prolactin, decreases
cortisol

00:31:24 Illness Impacts Testosterone & Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6

move individuals sexes toward parenting behavior less toward reproductive

females markedly reduces desire seeking sex sex illness,
many might say, "Well, duh, people feel sick, "they don't feel like seeking
mates, "they don't feel like sex," ever wondered
actually is? Well, turns can explained release called


inflammatory cytokines, cytokines related immune system, travel
lymph blood, attack invader cells like bacteria viruses,
conditions illness, make lot different cytokines, anti-
inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, best-known example
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, known IL-6, injected individuals,
will decrease desire sex eventually will reduce levels testosterone
estrogen independent feeling lousy, reason people don't want sex
sick levels IL-6 increased. Now, important
start think different ways modulate sex steroid hormones, so-
called optimize hormones, keeping levels IL-6 low going important
exert effects, now, IL-6 doesn't just travel gonads shut
gonads, actually ways interact receptors steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone, bind to, impact receptors
sex steroid hormones can't effect. short put simply, inflammatory
cytokines like IL-6 bad sex steroid hormones, going talk
modulate IL-6 direction want increase another
cytokine called IL-10, anti-inflammatory ways can help promote,
least support,

kind strange just mere act parent parenting can change
testosterone levels dramatically estradiol levels dramatically, it?

exercise modulate steroid hormones, going talk
various supplements, reference testosterone reference

endurance work, weight training failure, less intense weight training can impact
testosterone levels, want remind talking testosterone
males females, based know earlier episode,


testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided
optimal range. look web, people will say, "Oh, know,
"testosterone increased weight training, "you want big, heavy

scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,
squat? squat loading bunch weights bar then, know,
sitting down, essentially, standing again. deadlift?

except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen

solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase

little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone

somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every

meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not

hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase

excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase

01:14:10 Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing

light, temperature, talked parenthood, talked competition,
talked pheromone effects, now talk particular forms
exercise modulate steroid hormones, going talk
various supplements, reference testosterone reference
estrogen. now talk exercise various forms, weight training,
endurance work, weight training failure, less intense weight training can impact
testosterone levels, want remind talking testosterone
males females, based know earlier episode,


testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided
optimal range. look web, people will say, "Oh, know,
"testosterone increased weight training, "you want big, heavy
compound movements," squats deadlifts chins things sort,
scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,
squat? squat loading bunch weights bar then, know,
sitting down, essentially, standing again. deadlift?
lifting heavy weights ground. increase testosterone, right?
often not discussed weight training even exercise science
community, actually stimulate release testosterone adrenals
and/or testes, one it, adrenals testes both? often not
discussed, neuroscientist, kinds things think
think always genes don't create behavior, immune systems don't know
activated, lungs don't know inhale exhale, hearts don't know beat
except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen
receptor content, meaning testosterone derivatives, receptor content following
heavy-resistance exercise, find examples that, instance, know,
muscle biopsies, can actually see receptor increases, looking either high-
volume low-volume really intense exercise, can find lot not lot
mechanism nervous system this, reason want
know can potentially build better protocols figure
exactly movements triggering increases androgen receptors
testosterone. interesting start digging mechanistic
studies, find heavy weight training, weight training
sets done anywhere kind one eight rep range, translates
differently depending ratio muscle fiber type forth, basically
people working anywhere like, 70% 95% maximum, sometimes
even going right one-repetition maximum, really kind max effort,
find using nervous system way moving heavy loads,
translate recruitment high-threshold motor units, muscle


physiologists, rule muscle physiology neuron recruitment
moving muscles basically use minimum number motor units neurons
activate muscle possibly can, loads increase, recruit
neurons, always hear recruiting muscle fibers, really, recruiting
neurons recruit muscle fibers, find heavy weight
training, not weight training failure completion repetition impossible,
leads greatest increases testosterone. Now, sure bunch
exercise jockeys going come bunch things where,
oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training
heavy loads, anywhere one-rep maximum somewhere six eight
repetition range, males females, increases testosterone significantly,
day, sometimes 48 hours, studies found seem
hold rigor weight based published opposed
published journal "Never Heard It," published good-quality exercise
physiology journals, instance, paper Ratamess, R-A-T-A-M-E-S-S et al.,
published 2005, talks modulations androgen receptor content
heavy resistance exercise, looks going failure not failure, work
Izquierdo et al. published 2006, "Differential Effects Strength Training "Leading
Failure Versus Not Failure "on Hormonal Responses, Strength, Power Gains,"
know, lot studies will certainly put links
caption, many actually include Duncan French, runs UFC training
center privilege meeting discussing before,
well authors, course, point fact something
engagement neurons recruit high-threshold motor units muscle
moving heavy loads, not failure, provide sort feedback signal,
either gonad produce testosterone, increasing activity
receptors body. Now, say that? Well, puzzle, right?
particular movement, just like interacting child, increasing
decreasing testosterone? kind fundamental question mechanistic
level, answered question child-rearing, probably something
smell pheromones, although sure cues well,
clearly influence hard work neural level muscular level


increasing testosterone, also clearly effect working hard
presumably increasing cortisol much, although speculating there, terms
reducing testosterone, reason getting nitty-gritty
ultimately, really like understand, optimal protocols? know,
literature, hear, move heavy objects increase testosterone,
will converted powerful androgen, DHT, 5-alpha reductase et
cetera, really don't understand yet particular behaviors increase
testosterone whether not modulating receptors
modulating testosterone release directly, presumably, testosterone release directly
sensitivity receptors, muscle physiology studies
able find point to, basically boils particular set protocols
want increase testosterone, whatever reason, weight training heavy
loads not failure seems best-supported, least scientifically supported,
solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase
decrease androgen levels whether not combine endurance activity
weight training, whether not effect endurance activity first
second, takeaway endurance activity, performed first,
leads decreases testosterone weight training session compared
weight training session done first followed endurance activity, words,
want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something
recommending,

01:24:41 Estrogen & Menopause: Compounds May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms

just justifying rationale endurance athlete want
all. now switch talking estrogen, many people
trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood
mainly ovary now depleted estrogen production own,
eggs not produced, depleted, et cetera. menopause
characterized variety symptoms, multifaceted, probably deserves
entire episode own, things like hot flashes, things like mood swings, things like
headaches, particular migraine headaches, can lot brain fog, can
very, disruptive people. Now, sometimes hear andropause,


thought kind analog menopause, menopause certain
characteristics make robust phenomenon women, whereas
men, andropause going sometimes happen, sometimes won't, fact, without going
details graphs data, clear, mentioned earlier,
men maintain levels circulating androgens quite high, even similar
puberty teen years 20s, well 60s, 70s, 80s
optimizing lot things, probably genetics plays role well,
whereas males won't, within female population, population individuals
ovaries, stereotyped characteristic reduction estrogen
levels number eggs becomes depleted, think
menopause. various things one can menopause? Well, one
common ones physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen,
hormone therapy somebody takes either oral estrogen use
patch pellet, way secrete estradiol system, varying
success depending individual, people respond well it, people
really challenges it, lot side effects associated
people, not others, addition, concern always supplementing
estrogen breast cancer background family concern
breast cancer reason lot cancers estrogen-dependent,
drugs like tamoxifen anastrozole drugs block either
aromatase block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly initially developed,
see lot internet, again, sports folks trying increase
testosterone, reduce estrogen, remember, drugs initially developed
ways prevent estrogen binding estrogen receptor cancer treatments,
want clear said many times, always put caption
episode, course, not physician, not M.D., don't prescribe
anything, professor profess things, translate scientific literature
point might useful avenues exploration, just
information purposes, definitely talk doctor anything
talking now episode, matter. look literature
menopause outside just standard estrogen therapy, interesting
compounds used supported quality peer-
reviewed studies, again, refer amazing website,
examine.com, can put essentially condition supplement,


will point human effect matrix, not animal studies, human studies
explored things. Now, huge variety won't go
them, pro-estrogenic compounds shown
powerful context menopause, well conditions estrogen
lower one like, include description literature, get
moment, something like black cohosh, think correct pronunciation,
literally word black C-O-H-O-S-H, interesting, 13
peer-reviewed studies reached prominence kind commercial

well, interesting look studies many
carried period six-plus months, double-blind studies, et cetera,
almost lead modest increases estrogen modest decreases
menopause-related symptoms. Now, additional details studies,
generally carried women age 45 64, cases, look specifically
women clinically obese overweight, although not always, subject size
pools pretty big, know, anywhere 50 87, decent size, 132
subjects, et cetera, look like quality studies, basically point
fact black cohosh can modest effect improving menopause symptoms.
one Panax ginseng, P-N-A-A-X ginseng, shown decrease

actually, minor effects, things like, names little hard pronounce,
forgive me, things like Valeriana officinalis shown can

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper
ratios, things call sort usual suspects, vitamin D,
important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want
understand exactly negative effects not sufficient zinc
magnesium, levels might actually be, paper available,
can go PubMed, can't pronounce last name, sorry, looks like
Wrzosek, W-R-Z-O-S-E-K, hope didn't butcher badly, Wrzosek et al.
2020 "Endocrinology Metabolism Review," recent paper good,
peer-reviewed journal talks mainly hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal


axis sex steroid hormones negatively impacted deficiencies
magnesium, deficiencies vitamin D, deficiencies zinc, however, doesn't
point levels one take order optimize, doesn't say take X
amount zinc X amount magnesium X amount vitamin D, information,
context-dependent individual-dependent, highly recommend go
examine.com, can put zinc magnesium vitamin D, will give
ranges dosages supported specific studies, again, information
completely free you, useful figuring out. personally
supplemented zinc, magnesium, vitamin D years, many people
well, question always, much? proponent
getting blood work done know whether not androgen

takeaway studies looking deficiencies cause terms deficits
testosterone estrogen really point direction of, make sure getting
adequate zinc, magnesium, D3 unless want steroid hormone levels
reduced whatever reason.

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing
hormone neurons, neurons within hypothalamus communicate
pituitary, fact, people take large amounts opioids, even take low levels
opioids long periods time, will develop sorts endocrine syndromes,
shown again, gynecomastia, male breast development males,
disruptions ovary females, really quite terrible situation, excessive
opioids problematic sex steroid hormones, don't think anyone will
trouble finding literature that, can just go PubMed, can put opioids,
testosterone, opioids, estrogen, major effect actually way

testosterone estrogen release.

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual
consumption bull testes, can go Amazon right now, certainly don't suggest
this, can actually buy ground testes cows, can
consume those, now, lot going broken gut, certainly not
suggesting that, just point huge vast literature,
actually dates back hundreds years even though testosterone wasn't discovered
long ago specific hormone molecule characterized resynthesized,
huge industry powerful effects has, likewise estrogen,
development birth control pill made possible understanding

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,
dramatic role creating kind masculinization brain prenatally, also
defines primary sex characteristic growth penis, et cetera, beyond
infancy early childhood later life, powerful effects creating balding,
beard growth, et cetera, much higher affinity androgen receptor

DHT-susceptible, might experience hair loss,
heavily debated, creatine cause baldness? going depend, going
depend much 5-alpha reductase prone hair loss are,
people can take creatine without problem terms hair loss, people
cannot, start losing hair levels that, least them, aren't comfortable.
things can increase testosterone

01:40:14 Free Bound Testosterone: SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin), Tongat
Ali

way testosterone exists free bound form,
testosterone, molecule kind total testosterone, usually measured,
kind levels typically thrown around anywhere 300 900
kind natural range, supraphysiological, getting 1,200, 1,600
range, testosterone isn't just roaming around free blood, least
isn't, bound either sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG, albumin,
needed transporters get testosterone cells testosterone can
effects gene expression well pathways within cells, people
talk level free testosterone really important want
optimize free testosterone, little bit tricky statement, kind like,
true, yet, not really reflective thorough understanding binding
globulins work, remember, binding globulins aren't soak
testosterone just make hard free testosterone know, make

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available

excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper
ratios, things call sort usual suspects, vitamin D,
important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want
understand exactly negative effects not sufficient zinc
magnesium, levels might actually be, paper available,
can go PubMed, can't pronounce last name, sorry, looks like
Wrzosek, W-R-Z-O-S-E-K, hope didn't butcher badly, Wrzosek et al.
2020 "Endocrinology Metabolism Review," recent paper good,
peer-reviewed journal talks mainly hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal


axis sex steroid hormones negatively impacted deficiencies
magnesium, deficiencies vitamin D, deficiencies zinc, however, doesn't
point levels one take order optimize, doesn't say take X
amount zinc X amount magnesium X amount vitamin D, information,
context-dependent individual-dependent, highly recommend go

adequate zinc, magnesium, D3 unless want steroid hormone levels
reduced whatever reason.

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing
hormone neurons, neurons within hypothalamus communicate
pituitary, fact, people take large amounts opioids, even take low levels
opioids long periods time, will develop sorts endocrine syndromes,
shown again, gynecomastia, male breast development males,

testosterone estrogen release.

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual
consumption bull testes, can go Amazon right now, certainly don't suggest
this, can actually buy ground testes cows, can
consume those, now, lot going broken gut, certainly not
suggesting that, just point huge vast literature,
actually dates back hundreds years even though testosterone wasn't discovered
long ago specific hormone molecule characterized resynthesized,

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone

low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting

estrogen reductions fertility occur don't get enough sleep, seldom
discussed sleep actually adjusts things like testosterone estrogen,
modifying cortisol, molecule cholesterol can converted testosterone
estrogen, competition whereby cholesterol will turn cortisol
not testosterone, it'll turn cortisol not estrogen stress levels high,
simple version getting breathing right waking hours,
meaning primarily, unless working really hard reason
why, maybe eating speaking, need breathing
mouth, nose-breather, really good evidence now,
sleep, also want nose-breather going increase amount
oxygen bringing system amount carbon dioxide
offloading, positive effects well, basically
reducing apnea, breath-holding sleep leads buildup carbon dioxide leads
increases cortisol, decrease testosterone decrease estrogen
negative ways across sexes, okay? simple version get breathing
right, that, get breathing right? Well, people
severe sleep apnea, going need CPAP machine,
machine actually put face helps breathe properly sleep.
Many people, however, starting thing taping mouths shut, now,
sounds little bit extreme, certainly don't want way
dangerous. James Nestor talked book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art," simply taping shut mouth, tape will allow open


mouth really need to, sleep can allow people shift
mouth-breathers snorers nose-breathers. daytime, best way get
good nasal-breathing dilate nasal passages,

'cause lot people hard time breathing nose, one way
just breathe nose more, one way
exercise, particular, cardiovascular exercise, time, provided not

first piece behavioral advice.

00:56:30 Light Viewing Patterns & Hormones: Dopamine, GnRH

second piece behavioral advice relates viewing light, many
heard talk before, not going belabor point viewing
bright light within first hour waking, whether not artificial light ideally,
sunlight, powerful effects sleep wakefulness,
return want understand light can impact hormones
hormones, light, dopamine close-knit relationship, much
light-viewing behavior can actually direct effect hormone levels fertility,

spring months. Now, animals breed spring, shut
breeding, actually shut ovulation, often shut testosterone
production winter months, right now just correlating color fur
tendency breed, tendency breed, know, going related levels
sex steroid hormones, estrogen testosterone. Now, two things
linked? Well, turns dopamine link them, dopamine
precursor, precursor tyrosine, amino acid, comes food,
dopamine levels high, mentioned before, tendency
gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone,
hormones come hypothalamic-pituitary axis stimulate estrogen
testosterone release ovary testes, dopamine basically increases that.

describing people, regardless chromosomal gonadal background,
trying basically offer information one swoop, basically,
somebody naturally ovaries higher levels estrogen

01:06:03 Temperature: Cold & Hot Gonads

already have. Okay, talked breathing, talked light,
talk third element seems excitement lately
reasons can actually pretty profound influences hormone


levels, heat cold, always, rather just offer tool, going
tell underlying science relates naturally occurring phenomena because,
understanding understanding mechanism, going far
better position understand tools mechanisms might want
adjust life. now understand relationship light, day
length, dopamine, hormone levels, everyone realize temperature
day length linked, sure say that, probably thinking, "Oh,
course." summer, sunlight, days longer, nights shorter,
general, tends warmer out, winter, nights longer, days
shorter, tends colder out, winter months, testosterone estrogen

nowadays, lot interest using cold way stimulate testosterone,
mainly sports community, particular, bodybuilding community,

believe it, went checked, although didn't buy them, Amazon, can
actually find, literally underwear ice packs, think ice pack
underwear, people making cold level gonads
order try increase testosterone libido, sounds pretty crazy, believe
not, things like ice baths cold showers can positive effects sex
steroid hormones, testosterone, mainly males, estrogen, mainly females,
might say, "Wait, thought cold "makes reproductive axis kind shut

lot lore around heating gonads much, actually whole set
pseudoscience webpages saying, "Well, want girl, "you

now talked breathing,

01:14:10 Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing

light, temperature, talked parenthood, talked competition,
talked pheromone effects, now talk particular forms
exercise modulate steroid hormones, going talk
various supplements, reference testosterone reference
estrogen. now talk exercise various forms, weight training,
endurance work, weight training failure, less intense weight training can impact
testosterone levels, want remind talking testosterone
males females, based know earlier episode,


testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided
optimal range. look web, people will say, "Oh, know,
"testosterone increased weight training, "you want big, heavy
compound movements," squats deadlifts chins things sort,
scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,
squat? squat loading bunch weights bar then, know,
sitting down, essentially, standing again. deadlift?
lifting heavy weights ground. increase testosterone, right?
often not discussed weight training even exercise science
community, actually stimulate release testosterone adrenals
and/or testes, one it, adrenals testes both? often not
discussed, neuroscientist, kinds things think
think always genes don't create behavior, immune systems don't know
activated, lungs don't know inhale exhale, hearts don't know beat
except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen
receptor content, meaning testosterone derivatives, receptor content following
heavy-resistance exercise, find examples that, instance, know,
muscle biopsies, can actually see receptor increases, looking either high-
volume low-volume really intense exercise, can find lot not lot
mechanism nervous system this, reason want
know can potentially build better protocols figure
exactly movements triggering increases androgen receptors
testosterone. interesting start digging mechanistic
studies, find heavy weight training, weight training
sets done anywhere kind one eight rep range, translates
differently depending ratio muscle fiber type forth, basically
people working anywhere like, 70% 95% maximum, sometimes
even going right one-repetition maximum, really kind max effort,
find using nervous system way moving heavy loads,
translate recruitment high-threshold motor units, muscle


physiologists, rule muscle physiology neuron recruitment
moving muscles basically use minimum number motor units neurons
activate muscle possibly can, loads increase, recruit
neurons, always hear recruiting muscle fibers, really, recruiting
neurons recruit muscle fibers, find heavy weight
training, not weight training failure completion repetition impossible,
leads greatest increases testosterone. Now, sure bunch
exercise jockeys going come bunch things where,
oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training
heavy loads, anywhere one-rep maximum somewhere six eight
repetition range, males females, increases testosterone significantly,
day, sometimes 48 hours, studies found seem
hold rigor weight based published opposed
published journal "Never Heard It," published good-quality exercise
physiology journals, instance, paper Ratamess, R-A-T-A-M-E-S-S et al.,
published 2005, talks modulations androgen receptor content
heavy resistance exercise, looks going failure not failure, work
Izquierdo et al. published 2006, "Differential Effects Strength Training "Leading

know, lot studies will certainly put links
caption, many actually include Duncan French, runs UFC training
center privilege meeting discussing before,
well authors, course, point fact something
engagement neurons recruit high-threshold motor units muscle
moving heavy loads, not failure, provide sort feedback signal,
either gonad produce testosterone, increasing activity
receptors body. Now, say that? Well, puzzle, right?
particular movement, just like interacting child, increasing
decreasing testosterone? kind fundamental question mechanistic
level, answered question child-rearing, probably something
smell pheromones, although sure cues well,
clearly influence hard work neural level muscular level


increasing testosterone, also clearly effect working hard
presumably increasing cortisol much, although speculating there, terms
reducing testosterone, reason getting nitty-gritty
ultimately, really like understand, optimal protocols? know,
literature, hear, move heavy objects increase testosterone,
will converted powerful androgen, DHT, 5-alpha reductase et
cetera, really don't understand yet particular behaviors increase
testosterone whether not modulating receptors
modulating testosterone release directly, presumably, testosterone release directly
sensitivity receptors, muscle physiology studies
able find point to, basically boils particular set protocols
want increase testosterone, whatever reason, weight training heavy
loads not failure seems best-supported, least scientifically supported,
solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase
decrease androgen levels whether not combine endurance activity
weight training, whether not effect endurance activity first
second, takeaway endurance activity, performed first,
leads decreases testosterone weight training session compared
weight training session done first followed endurance activity, words,
want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something
recommending,

01:24:41 Estrogen & Menopause: Compounds May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms

all. now switch talking estrogen, many people
trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood
mainly ovary now depleted estrogen production own,

looking kind people talking about, also
mean scientific literature, one things new me, anyway, probably
not new lot gym rats there, people spend lot time
YouTube videos talking androgens, these, forgive butchering name
again, ecdysteroids, ecdysteroids molecules come things like
spinach, believe not, lot similarity cholesterol molecule, one
discussed lot right now something called turkesterone, wish
knew called turkesterone, someone tell called turkesterone,
anything turkeys? don't know called turkesterone, perhaps
someone will know. case, ecdysteroids similar enough cholesterol,
remember, cholesterol precursor testosterone, cortisol, estrogen,
appears ecdysteroids bioavailability, metabolites
bioavailable, something that, many years, people talked whether
not insect hormones hormones species actually used
humans whether not effect all, pretty clear based

cares? whole issue augmenting hormones sports interesting
issue, fact, just want little anecdote that, can't reveal names here,
course, learned recently surprising many athletes
pro sports taking testosterone, able legally not just
available prescription, allowed rules

supplementation, say, individuals can quite dramatic,
always, always, always, except extreme cases, going far subtler, excuse me, far
subtle, use proper English, far subtle be, instance, just
injecting testosterone injecting estrogen, et cetera, think just
honest upfront that. thus far terms talking optimizing hormones

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone

done vitro dish, hard eliminate things like
vasoconstriction vasodilation, put simply, don't know whether not cold
heat directly affect production testosterone estrogen, know cold
heat can modulate those, probably indirect mechanisms like controlling

lot lore around heating gonads much, actually whole set
pseudoscience webpages saying, "Well, want girl, "you
conceive child room temperature, "and want boy, "you
conceive child room temperature." don't think really firm scientific
evidence that, either one, interesting literature temperature

may independent heat's roles promoting estrogen testosterone. Okay,
now talked breathing,

01:14:10 Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing

light, temperature, talked parenthood, talked competition,
talked pheromone effects, now talk particular forms
exercise modulate steroid hormones, going talk
various supplements, reference testosterone reference
estrogen. now talk exercise various forms, weight training,
endurance work, weight training failure, less intense weight training can impact
testosterone levels, want remind talking testosterone
males females, based know earlier episode,


testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided
optimal range. look web, people will say, "Oh, know,
"testosterone increased weight training, "you want big, heavy
compound movements," squats deadlifts chins things sort,
scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,
squat? squat loading bunch weights bar then, know,
sitting down, essentially, standing again. deadlift?
lifting heavy weights ground. increase testosterone, right?
often not discussed weight training even exercise science
community, actually stimulate release testosterone adrenals
and/or testes, one it, adrenals testes both? often not
discussed, neuroscientist, kinds things think
think always genes don't create behavior, immune systems don't know
activated, lungs don't know inhale exhale, hearts don't know beat
except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen
receptor content, meaning testosterone derivatives, receptor content following
heavy-resistance exercise, find examples that, instance, know,
muscle biopsies, can actually see receptor increases, looking either high-
volume low-volume really intense exercise, can find lot not lot
mechanism nervous system this, reason want
know can potentially build better protocols figure
exactly movements triggering increases androgen receptors
testosterone. interesting start digging mechanistic
studies, find heavy weight training, weight training
sets done anywhere kind one eight rep range, translates
differently depending ratio muscle fiber type forth, basically
people working anywhere like, 70% 95% maximum, sometimes
even going right one-repetition maximum, really kind max effort,
find using nervous system way moving heavy loads,
translate recruitment high-threshold motor units, muscle


physiologists, rule muscle physiology neuron recruitment
moving muscles basically use minimum number motor units neurons
activate muscle possibly can, loads increase, recruit
neurons, always hear recruiting muscle fibers, really, recruiting
neurons recruit muscle fibers, find heavy weight
training, not weight training failure completion repetition impossible,
leads greatest increases testosterone. Now, sure bunch
exercise jockeys going come bunch things where,
oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training
heavy loads, anywhere one-rep maximum somewhere six eight
repetition range, males females, increases testosterone significantly,
day, sometimes 48 hours, studies found seem
hold rigor weight based published opposed
published journal "Never Heard It," published good-quality exercise
physiology journals, instance, paper Ratamess, R-A-T-A-M-E-S-S et al.,
published 2005, talks modulations androgen receptor content
heavy resistance exercise, looks going failure not failure, work
Izquierdo et al. published 2006, "Differential Effects Strength Training "Leading
Failure Versus Not Failure "on Hormonal Responses, Strength, Power Gains,"
know, lot studies will certainly put links
caption, many actually include Duncan French, runs UFC training
center privilege meeting discussing before,
well authors, course, point fact something
engagement neurons recruit high-threshold motor units muscle
moving heavy loads, not failure, provide sort feedback signal,
either gonad produce testosterone, increasing activity
receptors body. Now, say that? Well, puzzle, right?
particular movement, just like interacting child, increasing
decreasing testosterone? kind fundamental question mechanistic
level, answered question child-rearing, probably something
smell pheromones, although sure cues well,
clearly influence hard work neural level muscular level


increasing testosterone, also clearly effect working hard
presumably increasing cortisol much, although speculating there, terms
reducing testosterone, reason getting nitty-gritty
ultimately, really like understand, optimal protocols? know,
literature, hear, move heavy objects increase testosterone,
will converted powerful androgen, DHT, 5-alpha reductase et
cetera, really don't understand yet particular behaviors increase
testosterone whether not modulating receptors
modulating testosterone release directly, presumably, testosterone release directly
sensitivity receptors, muscle physiology studies
able find point to, basically boils particular set protocols
want increase testosterone, whatever reason, weight training heavy
loads not failure seems best-supported, least scientifically supported,
solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase
decrease androgen levels whether not combine endurance activity
weight training, whether not effect endurance activity first
second, takeaway endurance activity, performed first,
leads decreases testosterone weight training session compared
weight training session done first followed endurance activity, words,
want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something
recommending,

01:24:41 Estrogen & Menopause: Compounds May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms

just justifying rationale endurance athlete want
all. now switch talking estrogen, many people
trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood
mainly ovary now depleted estrogen production own,
eggs not produced, depleted, et cetera. menopause
characterized variety symptoms, multifaceted, probably deserves
entire episode own, things like hot flashes, things like mood swings, things like
headaches, particular migraine headaches, can lot brain fog, can
very, disruptive people. Now, sometimes hear andropause,


thought kind analog menopause, menopause certain
characteristics make robust phenomenon women, whereas
men, andropause going sometimes happen, sometimes won't, fact, without going
details graphs data, clear, mentioned earlier,
men maintain levels circulating androgens quite high, even similar
puberty teen years 20s, well 60s, 70s, 80s
optimizing lot things, probably genetics plays role well,
whereas males won't, within female population, population individuals
ovaries, stereotyped characteristic reduction estrogen
levels number eggs becomes depleted, think
menopause. various things one can menopause? Well, one
common ones physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen,
hormone therapy somebody takes either oral estrogen use
patch pellet, way secrete estradiol system, varying
success depending individual, people respond well it, people
really challenges it, lot side effects associated
people, not others, addition, concern always supplementing
estrogen breast cancer background family concern
breast cancer reason lot cancers estrogen-dependent,
drugs like tamoxifen anastrozole drugs block either
aromatase block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly initially developed,
see lot internet, again, sports folks trying increase
testosterone, reduce estrogen, remember, drugs initially developed
ways prevent estrogen binding estrogen receptor cancer treatments,
want clear said many times, always put caption
episode, course, not physician, not M.D., don't prescribe
anything, professor profess things, translate scientific literature
point might useful avenues exploration, just
information purposes, definitely talk doctor anything
talking now episode, matter. look literature
menopause outside just standard estrogen therapy, interesting
compounds used supported quality peer-
reviewed studies, again, refer amazing website,
examine.com, can put essentially condition supplement,


will point human effect matrix, not animal studies, human studies
explored things. Now, huge variety won't go
them, pro-estrogenic compounds shown
powerful context menopause, well conditions estrogen
lower one like, include description literature, get
moment, something like black cohosh, think correct pronunciation,
literally word black C-O-H-O-S-H, interesting, 13
peer-reviewed studies reached prominence kind commercial

well, interesting look studies many
carried period six-plus months, double-blind studies, et cetera,
almost lead modest increases estrogen modest decreases
menopause-related symptoms. Now, additional details studies,
generally carried women age 45 64, cases, look specifically
women clinically obese overweight, although not always, subject size
pools pretty big, know, anywhere 50 87, decent size, 132
subjects, et cetera, look like quality studies, basically point
fact black cohosh can modest effect improving menopause symptoms.
one Panax ginseng, P-N-A-A-X ginseng, shown decrease

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper
ratios, things call sort usual suspects, vitamin D,
important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want
understand exactly negative effects not sufficient zinc
magnesium, levels might actually be, paper available,
can go PubMed, can't pronounce last name, sorry, looks like
Wrzosek, W-R-Z-O-S-E-K, hope didn't butcher badly, Wrzosek et al.
2020 "Endocrinology Metabolism Review," recent paper good,
peer-reviewed journal talks mainly hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal


axis sex steroid hormones negatively impacted deficiencies
magnesium, deficiencies vitamin D, deficiencies zinc, however, doesn't
point levels one take order optimize, doesn't say take X
amount zinc X amount magnesium X amount vitamin D, information,
context-dependent individual-dependent, highly recommend go
examine.com, can put zinc magnesium vitamin D, will give
ranges dosages supported specific studies, again, information
completely free you, useful figuring out. personally
supplemented zinc, magnesium, vitamin D years, many people
well, question always, much? proponent
getting blood work done know whether not androgen

takeaway studies looking deficiencies cause terms deficits
testosterone estrogen really point direction of, make sure getting
adequate zinc, magnesium, D3 unless want steroid hormone levels
reduced whatever reason.

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing
hormone neurons, neurons within hypothalamus communicate
pituitary, fact, people take large amounts opioids, even take low levels
opioids long periods time, will develop sorts endocrine syndromes,
shown again, gynecomastia, male breast development males,
disruptions ovary females, really quite terrible situation, excessive
opioids problematic sex steroid hormones, don't think anyone will
trouble finding literature that, can just go PubMed, can put opioids,
testosterone, opioids, estrogen, major effect actually way
hypothalamus shut production GnRH, hormone stimulates


testosterone estrogen release.

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual
consumption bull testes, can go Amazon right now, certainly don't suggest
this, can actually buy ground testes cows, can
consume those, now, lot going broken gut, certainly not
suggesting that, just point huge vast literature,
actually dates back hundreds years even though testosterone wasn't discovered
long ago specific hormone molecule characterized resynthesized,
huge industry powerful effects has, likewise estrogen,
development birth control pill made possible understanding
structure estrogen estradiol, going talk birth control

supplement compounds supported scientific literature terms
ability adjust androgens,

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,
dramatic role creating kind masculinization brain prenatally, also
defines primary sex characteristic growth penis, et cetera, beyond
infancy early childhood later life, powerful effects creating balding,
beard growth, et cetera, much higher affinity androgen receptor
testosterone, creatine can increase DHT, means take creatine


DHT-susceptible, might experience hair loss,
heavily debated, creatine cause baldness? going depend, going
depend much 5-alpha reductase prone hair loss are,
people can take creatine without problem terms hair loss, people
cannot, start losing hair levels that, least them, aren't comfortable.
things can increase testosterone

01:40:14 Free Bound Testosterone: SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin), Tongat
Ali

way testosterone exists free bound form,
testosterone, molecule kind total testosterone, usually measured,
kind levels typically thrown around anywhere 300 900
kind natural range, supraphysiological, getting 1,200, 1,600
range, testosterone isn't just roaming around free blood, least
isn't, bound either sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG, albumin,
needed transporters get testosterone cells testosterone can
effects gene expression well pathways within cells, people
talk level free testosterone really important want
optimize free testosterone, little bit tricky statement, kind like,
true, yet, not really reflective thorough understanding binding
globulins work, remember, binding globulins aren't soak
testosterone just make hard free testosterone know, make
gains gym whatever is, increases libido, actually
transport testosterone specific tissues, shuttle specific tissues set

support freeing testosterone, again, freeing testosterone may
exactly want, just don't think demonize carrier proteins
like albumin SHBG, fact, albumin important testosterone able

01:47:43 Ecdysteroids: Mimic Mammalian Hormones

looking kind people talking about, also
mean scientific literature, one things new me, anyway, probably
not new lot gym rats there, people spend lot time
YouTube videos talking androgens, these, forgive butchering name
again, ecdysteroids, ecdysteroids molecules come things like

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone
background menstrual cycle really going disrupt way things interact,
just exquisite feedback loop, not saying don't that,
definitely want aware doing, blood draws one way

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase

episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase

excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can

day length linked, sure say that, probably thinking, "Oh,
course." summer, sunlight, days longer, nights shorter,
general, tends warmer out, winter, nights longer, days
shorter, tends colder out, winter months, testosterone estrogen
tend lower many animals humans, summer months,
role dopamine promoting sex steroid hormones, days longer
warmer, humans tend make estrogen testosterone relative

artificial heating artificial cooling, biology evolved systems
temperature, day length, hormones correlated one another,
nowadays, lot interest using cold way stimulate testosterone,
mainly sports community, particular, bodybuilding community,
always seeking ways maximize testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, keep
estrogen minimum required still libido still skin elasticity
also walk around Saran-wrap skin, kind extreme stuff happens
led recent movement where, believe not, heard couldn't
believe it, went checked, although didn't buy them, Amazon, can
actually find, literally underwear ice packs, think ice pack
underwear, people making cold level gonads
order try increase testosterone libido, sounds pretty crazy, believe
not, things like ice baths cold showers can positive effects sex
steroid hormones, testosterone, mainly males, estrogen, mainly females,
might say, "Wait, thought cold "makes reproductive axis kind shut
bit "or reduces testosterone estrogen," turns not actually cold

remember gonad, ovaries testes heavily vascularized.
Remember, even level brain, GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

right? discussed discussion stress stress episode,
well-known neuroscientists best way shut neurons cool them,
lot examples scientific literature, people aren't

want shut neurons, can things like inject drugs will that,
like lidocaine, know, stuff makes numb dentist, can use

lot lore around heating gonads much, actually whole set

now talked breathing,

01:14:10 Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing

light, temperature, talked parenthood, talked competition,
talked pheromone effects, now talk particular forms
exercise modulate steroid hormones, going talk
various supplements, reference testosterone reference
estrogen. now talk exercise various forms, weight training,
endurance work, weight training failure, less intense weight training can impact
testosterone levels, want remind talking testosterone
males females, based know earlier episode,


testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided
optimal range. look web, people will say, "Oh, know,
"testosterone increased weight training, "you want big, heavy
compound movements," squats deadlifts chins things sort,
scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,
squat? squat loading bunch weights bar then, know,
sitting down, essentially, standing again. deadlift?
lifting heavy weights ground. increase testosterone, right?
often not discussed weight training even exercise science
community, actually stimulate release testosterone adrenals
and/or testes, one it, adrenals testes both? often not
discussed, neuroscientist, kinds things think
think always genes don't create behavior, immune systems don't know
activated, lungs don't know inhale exhale, hearts don't know beat
except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen
receptor content, meaning testosterone derivatives, receptor content following
heavy-resistance exercise, find examples that, instance, know,
muscle biopsies, can actually see receptor increases, looking either high-
volume low-volume really intense exercise, can find lot not lot
mechanism nervous system this, reason want
know can potentially build better protocols figure
exactly movements triggering increases androgen receptors
testosterone. interesting start digging mechanistic
studies, find heavy weight training, weight training
sets done anywhere kind one eight rep range, translates
differently depending ratio muscle fiber type forth, basically
people working anywhere like, 70% 95% maximum, sometimes
even going right one-repetition maximum, really kind max effort,
find using nervous system way moving heavy loads,
translate recruitment high-threshold motor units, muscle


physiologists, rule muscle physiology neuron recruitment
moving muscles basically use minimum number motor units neurons
activate muscle possibly can, loads increase, recruit
neurons, always hear recruiting muscle fibers, really, recruiting
neurons recruit muscle fibers, find heavy weight
training, not weight training failure completion repetition impossible,
leads greatest increases testosterone. Now, sure bunch
exercise jockeys going come bunch things where,
oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training
heavy loads, anywhere one-rep maximum somewhere six eight
repetition range, males females, increases testosterone significantly,
day, sometimes 48 hours, studies found seem
hold rigor weight based published opposed
published journal "Never Heard It," published good-quality exercise
physiology journals, instance, paper Ratamess, R-A-T-A-M-E-S-S et al.,
published 2005, talks modulations androgen receptor content
heavy resistance exercise, looks going failure not failure, work
Izquierdo et al. published 2006, "Differential Effects Strength Training "Leading

know, lot studies will certainly put links

well authors, course, point fact something
engagement neurons recruit high-threshold motor units muscle
moving heavy loads, not failure, provide sort feedback signal,
either gonad produce testosterone, increasing activity
receptors body. Now, say that? Well, puzzle, right?
particular movement, just like interacting child, increasing
decreasing testosterone? kind fundamental question mechanistic
level, answered question child-rearing, probably something
smell pheromones, although sure cues well,
clearly influence hard work neural level muscular level


increasing testosterone, also clearly effect working hard
presumably increasing cortisol much, although speculating there, terms
reducing testosterone, reason getting nitty-gritty
ultimately, really like understand, optimal protocols? know,
literature, hear, move heavy objects increase testosterone,
will converted powerful androgen, DHT, 5-alpha reductase et
cetera, really don't understand yet particular behaviors increase
testosterone whether not modulating receptors
modulating testosterone release directly, presumably, testosterone release directly
sensitivity receptors, muscle physiology studies
able find point to, basically boils particular set protocols
want increase testosterone, whatever reason, weight training heavy
loads not failure seems best-supported, least scientifically supported,
solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase
decrease androgen levels whether not combine endurance activity
weight training, whether not effect endurance activity first
second, takeaway endurance activity, performed first,
leads decreases testosterone weight training session compared
weight training session done first followed endurance activity, words,
want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something
recommending,

01:24:41 Estrogen & Menopause: Compounds May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms

just justifying rationale endurance athlete want
all. now switch talking estrogen, many people
trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood
mainly ovary now depleted estrogen production own,
eggs not produced, depleted, et cetera. menopause
characterized variety symptoms, multifaceted, probably deserves
entire episode own, things like hot flashes, things like mood swings, things like
headaches, particular migraine headaches, can lot brain fog, can
very, disruptive people. Now, sometimes hear andropause,


thought kind analog menopause, menopause certain
characteristics make robust phenomenon women, whereas
men, andropause going sometimes happen, sometimes won't, fact, without going
details graphs data, clear, mentioned earlier,
men maintain levels circulating androgens quite high, even similar

optimizing lot things, probably genetics plays role well,
whereas males won't, within female population, population individuals
ovaries, stereotyped characteristic reduction estrogen

menopause. various things one can menopause? Well, one
common ones physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen,

drugs like tamoxifen anastrozole drugs block either
aromatase block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly initially developed,
see lot internet, again, sports folks trying increase
testosterone, reduce estrogen, remember, drugs initially developed
ways prevent estrogen binding estrogen receptor cancer treatments,
want clear said many times, always put caption

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels

low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject

testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone

01:06:03 Temperature: Cold & Hot Gonads

already have. Okay, talked breathing, talked light,
talk third element seems excitement lately
reasons can actually pretty profound influences hormone

day length linked, sure say that, probably thinking, "Oh,
course." summer, sunlight, days longer, nights shorter,

lot lore around heating gonads much, actually whole set

except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen

modulating testosterone release directly, presumably, testosterone release directly

able find point to, basically boils particular set protocols
want increase testosterone, whatever reason, weight training heavy

solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase

want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something

promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-

interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available

excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs

01:14:10 Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing

light, temperature, talked parenthood, talked competition,
talked pheromone effects, now talk particular forms
exercise modulate steroid hormones, going talk
various supplements, reference testosterone reference
estrogen. now talk exercise various forms, weight training,
endurance work, weight training failure, less intense weight training can impact
testosterone levels, want remind talking testosterone
males females, based know earlier episode,


testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided
optimal range. look web, people will say, "Oh, know,
"testosterone increased weight training, "you want big, heavy
compound movements," squats deadlifts chins things sort,
scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,
squat? squat loading bunch weights bar then, know,
sitting down, essentially, standing again. deadlift?
lifting heavy weights ground. increase testosterone, right?
often not discussed weight training even exercise science
community, actually stimulate release testosterone adrenals
and/or testes, one it, adrenals testes both? often not
discussed, neuroscientist, kinds things think
think always genes don't create behavior, immune systems don't know
activated, lungs don't know inhale exhale, hearts don't know beat
except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen
receptor content, meaning testosterone derivatives, receptor content following
heavy-resistance exercise, find examples that, instance, know,
muscle biopsies, can actually see receptor increases, looking either high-
volume low-volume really intense exercise, can find lot not lot
mechanism nervous system this, reason want
know can potentially build better protocols figure
exactly movements triggering increases androgen receptors
testosterone. interesting start digging mechanistic
studies, find heavy weight training, weight training
sets done anywhere kind one eight rep range, translates
differently depending ratio muscle fiber type forth, basically
people working anywhere like, 70% 95% maximum, sometimes
even going right one-repetition maximum, really kind max effort,
find using nervous system way moving heavy loads,
translate recruitment high-threshold motor units, muscle


physiologists, rule muscle physiology neuron recruitment
moving muscles basically use minimum number motor units neurons
activate muscle possibly can, loads increase, recruit
neurons, always hear recruiting muscle fibers, really, recruiting
neurons recruit muscle fibers, find heavy weight

leads greatest increases testosterone. Now, sure bunch
exercise jockeys going come bunch things where,
oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training
heavy loads, anywhere one-rep maximum somewhere six eight

smell pheromones, although sure cues well,
clearly influence hard work neural level muscular level


increasing testosterone, also clearly effect working hard
presumably increasing cortisol much, although speculating there, terms
reducing testosterone, reason getting nitty-gritty
ultimately, really like understand, optimal protocols? know,
literature, hear, move heavy objects increase testosterone,
will converted powerful androgen, DHT, 5-alpha reductase et
cetera, really don't understand yet particular behaviors increase
testosterone whether not modulating receptors
modulating testosterone release directly, presumably, testosterone release directly
sensitivity receptors, muscle physiology studies
able find point to, basically boils particular set protocols
want increase testosterone, whatever reason, weight training heavy

solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase
decrease androgen levels whether not combine endurance activity
weight training, whether not effect endurance activity first
second, takeaway endurance activity, performed first,
leads decreases testosterone weight training session compared
weight training session done first followed endurance activity, words,
want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something
recommending,

01:24:41 Estrogen & Menopause: Compounds May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms

just justifying rationale endurance athlete want
all. now switch talking estrogen, many people
trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood
mainly ovary now depleted estrogen production own,
eggs not produced, depleted, et cetera. menopause
characterized variety symptoms, multifaceted, probably deserves
entire episode own, things like hot flashes, things like mood swings, things like
headaches, particular migraine headaches, can lot brain fog, can
very, disruptive people. Now, sometimes hear andropause,


thought kind analog menopause, menopause certain
characteristics make robust phenomenon women, whereas
men, andropause going sometimes happen, sometimes won't, fact, without going
details graphs data, clear, mentioned earlier,
men maintain levels circulating androgens quite high, even similar

optimizing lot things, probably genetics plays role well,
whereas males won't, within female population, population individuals
ovaries, stereotyped characteristic reduction estrogen

menopause. various things one can menopause? Well, one
common ones physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen,
hormone therapy somebody takes either oral estrogen use
patch pellet, way secrete estradiol system, varying

drugs like tamoxifen anastrozole drugs block either
aromatase block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly initially developed,
see lot internet, again, sports folks trying increase
testosterone, reduce estrogen, remember, drugs initially developed
ways prevent estrogen binding estrogen receptor cancer treatments,
want clear said many times, always put caption

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper
ratios, things call sort usual suspects, vitamin D,
important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want
understand exactly negative effects not sufficient zinc
magnesium, levels might actually be, paper available,
can go PubMed, can't pronounce last name, sorry, looks like

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing

testosterone estrogen release.

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual
consumption bull testes, can go Amazon right now, certainly don't suggest
this, can actually buy ground testes cows, can
consume those, now, lot going broken gut, certainly not

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase

excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels

low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject

testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone

00:51:11 Sleep Adjusts Cortisol/Testosterone Cortisol/Estrogen Ratios

showing apnea reduced sleep, eliminated, significant

females, way works interesting, apparently, works reductions
cortisol, now, cortisol stress hormone released early day wake
serves healthy roles protecting us infection, reducing inflammation, et
cetera, don't want cortisol high, certainly don't want elevated

lot last decade so, getting proper sleep important aspects
health, getting proper sleep can really offset reductions testosterone
estrogen reductions fertility occur don't get enough sleep, seldom
discussed sleep actually adjusts things like testosterone estrogen,
modifying cortisol, molecule cholesterol can converted testosterone
estrogen, competition whereby cholesterol will turn cortisol
not testosterone, it'll turn cortisol not estrogen stress levels high,
simple version getting breathing right waking hours,
meaning primarily, unless working really hard reason
why, maybe eating speaking, need breathing
mouth, nose-breather, really good evidence now,
sleep, also want nose-breather going increase amount
oxygen bringing system amount carbon dioxide
offloading, positive effects well, basically
reducing apnea, breath-holding sleep leads buildup carbon dioxide leads
increases cortisol, decrease testosterone decrease estrogen
negative ways across sexes, okay? simple version get breathing
right, that, get breathing right? Well, people
severe sleep apnea, going need CPAP machine,
machine actually put face helps breathe properly sleep.
Many people, however, starting thing taping mouths shut, now,
sounds little bit extreme, certainly don't want way
dangerous. James Nestor talked book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art," simply taping shut mouth, tape will allow open


mouth really need to, sleep can allow people shift

'cause lot people hard time breathing nose, one way
just breathe nose more, one way
exercise, particular, cardiovascular exercise, time, provided not

00:56:30 Light Viewing Patterns & Hormones: Dopamine, GnRH

second piece behavioral advice relates viewing light, many

linked? Well, turns dopamine link them, dopamine
precursor, precursor tyrosine, amino acid, comes food,
dopamine levels high, mentioned before, tendency

01:06:03 Temperature: Cold & Hot Gonads

already have. Okay, talked breathing, talked light,
talk third element seems excitement lately
reasons can actually pretty profound influences hormone


levels, heat cold, always, rather just offer tool, going
tell underlying science relates naturally occurring phenomena because,
understanding understanding mechanism, going far
better position understand tools mechanisms might want
adjust life. now understand relationship light, day
length, dopamine, hormone levels, everyone realize temperature
day length linked, sure say that, probably thinking, "Oh,
course." summer, sunlight, days longer, nights shorter,
general, tends warmer out, winter, nights longer, days
shorter, tends colder out, winter months, testosterone estrogen

believe it, went checked, although didn't buy them, Amazon, can
actually find, literally underwear ice packs, think ice pack
underwear, people making cold level gonads
order try increase testosterone libido, sounds pretty crazy, believe
not, things like ice baths cold showers can positive effects sex
steroid hormones, testosterone, mainly males, estrogen, mainly females,
might say, "Wait, thought cold "makes reproductive axis kind shut

remember gonad, ovaries testes heavily vascularized.
Remember, even level brain, GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

right? discussed discussion stress stress episode,
well-known neuroscientists best way shut neurons cool them,
lot examples scientific literature, people aren't

want shut neurons, can things like inject drugs will that,
like lidocaine, know, stuff makes numb dentist, can use

vasoconstriction vasodilation, put simply, don't know whether not cold
heat directly affect production testosterone estrogen, know cold
heat can modulate those, probably indirect mechanisms like controlling

lot lore around heating gonads much, actually whole set
pseudoscience webpages saying, "Well, want girl, "you

now talked breathing,

01:14:10 Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing

light, temperature, talked parenthood, talked competition,
talked pheromone effects, now talk particular forms
exercise modulate steroid hormones, going talk
various supplements, reference testosterone reference
estrogen. now talk exercise various forms, weight training,
endurance work, weight training failure, less intense weight training can impact
testosterone levels, want remind talking testosterone
males females, based know earlier episode,


testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided
optimal range. look web, people will say, "Oh, know,
"testosterone increased weight training, "you want big, heavy
compound movements," squats deadlifts chins things sort,
scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,
squat? squat loading bunch weights bar then, know,
sitting down, essentially, standing again. deadlift?
lifting heavy weights ground. increase testosterone, right?
often not discussed weight training even exercise science
community, actually stimulate release testosterone adrenals
and/or testes, one it, adrenals testes both? often not
discussed, neuroscientist, kinds things think
think always genes don't create behavior, immune systems don't know
activated, lungs don't know inhale exhale, hearts don't know beat
except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen
receptor content, meaning testosterone derivatives, receptor content following
heavy-resistance exercise, find examples that, instance, know,
muscle biopsies, can actually see receptor increases, looking either high-
volume low-volume really intense exercise, can find lot not lot
mechanism nervous system this, reason want
know can potentially build better protocols figure
exactly movements triggering increases androgen receptors
testosterone. interesting start digging mechanistic
studies, find heavy weight training, weight training
sets done anywhere kind one eight rep range, translates
differently depending ratio muscle fiber type forth, basically
people working anywhere like, 70% 95% maximum, sometimes
even going right one-repetition maximum, really kind max effort,
find using nervous system way moving heavy loads,
translate recruitment high-threshold motor units, muscle


physiologists, rule muscle physiology neuron recruitment
moving muscles basically use minimum number motor units neurons
activate muscle possibly can, loads increase, recruit
neurons, always hear recruiting muscle fibers, really, recruiting
neurons recruit muscle fibers, find heavy weight
training, not weight training failure completion repetition impossible,
leads greatest increases testosterone. Now, sure bunch
exercise jockeys going come bunch things where,
oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training
heavy loads, anywhere one-rep maximum somewhere six eight
repetition range, males females, increases testosterone significantly,
day, sometimes 48 hours, studies found seem
hold rigor weight based published opposed
published journal "Never Heard It," published good-quality exercise
physiology journals, instance, paper Ratamess, R-A-T-A-M-E-S-S et al.,
published 2005, talks modulations androgen receptor content
heavy resistance exercise, looks going failure not failure, work
Izquierdo et al. published 2006, "Differential Effects Strength Training "Leading

know, lot studies will certainly put links
caption, many actually include Duncan French, runs UFC training

well authors, course, point fact something
engagement neurons recruit high-threshold motor units muscle
moving heavy loads, not failure, provide sort feedback signal,
either gonad produce testosterone, increasing activity
receptors body. Now, say that? Well, puzzle, right?
particular movement, just like interacting child, increasing
decreasing testosterone? kind fundamental question mechanistic
level, answered question child-rearing, probably something
smell pheromones, although sure cues well,
clearly influence hard work neural level muscular level


increasing testosterone, also clearly effect working hard
presumably increasing cortisol much, although speculating there, terms
reducing testosterone, reason getting nitty-gritty
ultimately, really like understand, optimal protocols? know,
literature, hear, move heavy objects increase testosterone,
will converted powerful androgen, DHT, 5-alpha reductase et
cetera, really don't understand yet particular behaviors increase
testosterone whether not modulating receptors
modulating testosterone release directly, presumably, testosterone release directly
sensitivity receptors, muscle physiology studies
able find point to, basically boils particular set protocols
want increase testosterone, whatever reason, weight training heavy
loads not failure seems best-supported, least scientifically supported,
solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase
decrease androgen levels whether not combine endurance activity
weight training, whether not effect endurance activity first
second, takeaway endurance activity, performed first,
leads decreases testosterone weight training session compared
weight training session done first followed endurance activity, words,
want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something
recommending,

01:24:41 Estrogen & Menopause: Compounds May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms

just justifying rationale endurance athlete want
all. now switch talking estrogen, many people
trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood
mainly ovary now depleted estrogen production own,

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase

episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase

excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase

except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen

exercise jockeys going come bunch things where,
oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training

smell pheromones, although sure cues well,
clearly influence hard work neural level muscular level


increasing testosterone, also clearly effect working hard
presumably increasing cortisol much, although speculating there, terms
reducing testosterone, reason getting nitty-gritty
ultimately, really like understand, optimal protocols? know,
literature, hear, move heavy objects increase testosterone,
will converted powerful androgen, DHT, 5-alpha reductase et
cetera, really don't understand yet particular behaviors increase
testosterone whether not modulating receptors
modulating testosterone release directly, presumably, testosterone release directly
sensitivity receptors, muscle physiology studies
able find point to, basically boils particular set protocols
want increase testosterone, whatever reason, weight training heavy

solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,

weight training, whether not effect endurance activity first
second, takeaway endurance activity, performed first,
leads decreases testosterone weight training session compared
weight training session done first followed endurance activity, words,
want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper

important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual

this, can actually buy ground testes cows, can
consume those, now, lot going broken gut, certainly not
suggesting that, just point huge vast literature,
actually dates back hundreds years even though testosterone wasn't discovered
long ago specific hormone molecule characterized resynthesized,

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone

done vitro dish, hard eliminate things like
vasoconstriction vasodilation, put simply, don't know whether not cold
heat directly affect production testosterone estrogen, know cold
heat can modulate those, probably indirect mechanisms like controlling

lot lore around heating gonads much, actually whole set
pseudoscience webpages saying, "Well, want girl, "you

now talked breathing,

01:14:10 Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing

light, temperature, talked parenthood, talked competition,
talked pheromone effects, now talk particular forms
exercise modulate steroid hormones, going talk
various supplements, reference testosterone reference
estrogen. now talk exercise various forms, weight training,
endurance work, weight training failure, less intense weight training can impact
testosterone levels, want remind talking testosterone
males females, based know earlier episode,


testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided
optimal range. look web, people will say, "Oh, know,
"testosterone increased weight training, "you want big, heavy
compound movements," squats deadlifts chins things sort,
scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,
squat? squat loading bunch weights bar then, know,
sitting down, essentially, standing again. deadlift?
lifting heavy weights ground. increase testosterone, right?
often not discussed weight training even exercise science
community, actually stimulate release testosterone adrenals
and/or testes, one it, adrenals testes both? often not
discussed, neuroscientist, kinds things think
think always genes don't create behavior, immune systems don't know
activated, lungs don't know inhale exhale, hearts don't know beat
except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen
receptor content, meaning testosterone derivatives, receptor content following
heavy-resistance exercise, find examples that, instance, know,
muscle biopsies, can actually see receptor increases, looking either high-
volume low-volume really intense exercise, can find lot not lot
mechanism nervous system this, reason want
know can potentially build better protocols figure
exactly movements triggering increases androgen receptors
testosterone. interesting start digging mechanistic
studies, find heavy weight training, weight training
sets done anywhere kind one eight rep range, translates
differently depending ratio muscle fiber type forth, basically
people working anywhere like, 70% 95% maximum, sometimes
even going right one-repetition maximum, really kind max effort,
find using nervous system way moving heavy loads,
translate recruitment high-threshold motor units, muscle


physiologists, rule muscle physiology neuron recruitment
moving muscles basically use minimum number motor units neurons
activate muscle possibly can, loads increase, recruit
neurons, always hear recruiting muscle fibers, really, recruiting
neurons recruit muscle fibers, find heavy weight
training, not weight training failure completion repetition impossible,
leads greatest increases testosterone. Now, sure bunch
exercise jockeys going come bunch things where,
oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training
heavy loads, anywhere one-rep maximum somewhere six eight
repetition range, males females, increases testosterone significantly,
day, sometimes 48 hours, studies found seem
hold rigor weight based published opposed
published journal "Never Heard It," published good-quality exercise
physiology journals, instance, paper Ratamess, R-A-T-A-M-E-S-S et al.,
published 2005, talks modulations androgen receptor content
heavy resistance exercise, looks going failure not failure, work
Izquierdo et al. published 2006, "Differential Effects Strength Training "Leading
Failure Versus Not Failure "on Hormonal Responses, Strength, Power Gains,"
know, lot studies will certainly put links
caption, many actually include Duncan French, runs UFC training
center privilege meeting discussing before,
well authors, course, point fact something
engagement neurons recruit high-threshold motor units muscle
moving heavy loads, not failure, provide sort feedback signal,
either gonad produce testosterone, increasing activity
receptors body. Now, say that? Well, puzzle, right?
particular movement, just like interacting child, increasing
decreasing testosterone? kind fundamental question mechanistic
level, answered question child-rearing, probably something
smell pheromones, although sure cues well,
clearly influence hard work neural level muscular level


increasing testosterone, also clearly effect working hard
presumably increasing cortisol much, although speculating there, terms
reducing testosterone, reason getting nitty-gritty
ultimately, really like understand, optimal protocols? know,
literature, hear, move heavy objects increase testosterone,
will converted powerful androgen, DHT, 5-alpha reductase et
cetera, really don't understand yet particular behaviors increase
testosterone whether not modulating receptors
modulating testosterone release directly, presumably, testosterone release directly
sensitivity receptors, muscle physiology studies
able find point to, basically boils particular set protocols
want increase testosterone, whatever reason, weight training heavy
loads not failure seems best-supported, least scientifically supported,
solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase
decrease androgen levels whether not combine endurance activity
weight training, whether not effect endurance activity first
second, takeaway endurance activity, performed first,
leads decreases testosterone weight training session compared
weight training session done first followed endurance activity, words,
want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something
recommending,

01:24:41 Estrogen & Menopause: Compounds May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms

just justifying rationale endurance athlete want
all. now switch talking estrogen, many people
trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood
mainly ovary now depleted estrogen production own,
eggs not produced, depleted, et cetera. menopause
characterized variety symptoms, multifaceted, probably deserves
entire episode own, things like hot flashes, things like mood swings, things like
headaches, particular migraine headaches, can lot brain fog, can
very, disruptive people. Now, sometimes hear andropause,


thought kind analog menopause, menopause certain
characteristics make robust phenomenon women, whereas
men, andropause going sometimes happen, sometimes won't, fact, without going
details graphs data, clear, mentioned earlier,
men maintain levels circulating androgens quite high, even similar
puberty teen years 20s, well 60s, 70s, 80s
optimizing lot things, probably genetics plays role well,
whereas males won't, within female population, population individuals
ovaries, stereotyped characteristic reduction estrogen
levels number eggs becomes depleted, think
menopause. various things one can menopause? Well, one
common ones physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen,
hormone therapy somebody takes either oral estrogen use
patch pellet, way secrete estradiol system, varying
success depending individual, people respond well it, people
really challenges it, lot side effects associated
people, not others, addition, concern always supplementing
estrogen breast cancer background family concern
breast cancer reason lot cancers estrogen-dependent,
drugs like tamoxifen anastrozole drugs block either
aromatase block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly initially developed,
see lot internet, again, sports folks trying increase
testosterone, reduce estrogen, remember, drugs initially developed
ways prevent estrogen binding estrogen receptor cancer treatments,
want clear said many times, always put caption
episode, course, not physician, not M.D., don't prescribe
anything, professor profess things, translate scientific literature
point might useful avenues exploration, just
information purposes, definitely talk doctor anything
talking now episode, matter. look literature
menopause outside just standard estrogen therapy, interesting
compounds used supported quality peer-
reviewed studies, again, refer amazing website,
examine.com, can put essentially condition supplement,


will point human effect matrix, not animal studies, human studies
explored things. Now, huge variety won't go
them, pro-estrogenic compounds shown
powerful context menopause, well conditions estrogen
lower one like, include description literature, get
moment, something like black cohosh, think correct pronunciation,
literally word black C-O-H-O-S-H, interesting, 13
peer-reviewed studies reached prominence kind commercial

almost lead modest increases estrogen modest decreases
menopause-related symptoms. Now, additional details studies,
generally carried women age 45 64, cases, look specifically
women clinically obese overweight, although not always, subject size
pools pretty big, know, anywhere 50 87, decent size, 132
subjects, et cetera, look like quality studies, basically point
fact black cohosh can modest effect improving menopause symptoms.
one Panax ginseng, P-N-A-A-X ginseng, shown decrease

actually, minor effects, things like, names little hard pronounce,
forgive me, things like Valeriana officinalis shown can

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper
ratios, things call sort usual suspects, vitamin D,
important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want
understand exactly negative effects not sufficient zinc
magnesium, levels might actually be, paper available,
can go PubMed, can't pronounce last name, sorry, looks like
Wrzosek, W-R-Z-O-S-E-K, hope didn't butcher badly, Wrzosek et al.
2020 "Endocrinology Metabolism Review," recent paper good,
peer-reviewed journal talks mainly hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal


axis sex steroid hormones negatively impacted deficiencies
magnesium, deficiencies vitamin D, deficiencies zinc, however, doesn't
point levels one take order optimize, doesn't say take X
amount zinc X amount magnesium X amount vitamin D, information,
context-dependent individual-dependent, highly recommend go
examine.com, can put zinc magnesium vitamin D, will give
ranges dosages supported specific studies, again, information
completely free you, useful figuring out. personally
supplemented zinc, magnesium, vitamin D years, many people
well, question always, much? proponent
getting blood work done know whether not androgen

takeaway studies looking deficiencies cause terms deficits
testosterone estrogen really point direction of, make sure getting
adequate zinc, magnesium, D3 unless want steroid hormone levels
reduced whatever reason.

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing
hormone neurons, neurons within hypothalamus communicate
pituitary, fact, people take large amounts opioids, even take low levels
opioids long periods time, will develop sorts endocrine syndromes,
shown again, gynecomastia, male breast development males,
disruptions ovary females, really quite terrible situation, excessive
opioids problematic sex steroid hormones, don't think anyone will
trouble finding literature that, can just go PubMed, can put opioids,
testosterone, opioids, estrogen, major effect actually way

testosterone estrogen release.

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual
consumption bull testes, can go Amazon right now, certainly don't suggest
this, can actually buy ground testes cows, can
consume those, now, lot going broken gut, certainly not
suggesting that, just point huge vast literature,
actually dates back hundreds years even though testosterone wasn't discovered
long ago specific hormone molecule characterized resynthesized,
huge industry powerful effects has, likewise estrogen,
development birth control pill made possible understanding

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,
dramatic role creating kind masculinization brain prenatally, also
defines primary sex characteristic growth penis, et cetera, beyond
infancy early childhood later life, powerful effects creating balding,
beard growth, et cetera, much higher affinity androgen receptor

DHT-susceptible, might experience hair loss,
heavily debated, creatine cause baldness? going depend, going
depend much 5-alpha reductase prone hair loss are,
people can take creatine without problem terms hair loss, people
cannot, start losing hair levels that, least them, aren't comfortable.
things can increase testosterone

01:40:14 Free Bound Testosterone: SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin), Tongat
Ali

way testosterone exists free bound form,
testosterone, molecule kind total testosterone, usually measured,
kind levels typically thrown around anywhere 300 900
kind natural range, supraphysiological, getting 1,200, 1,600
range, testosterone isn't just roaming around free blood, least
isn't, bound either sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG, albumin,
needed transporters get testosterone cells testosterone can
effects gene expression well pathways within cells, people
talk level free testosterone really important want
optimize free testosterone, little bit tricky statement, kind like,
true, yet, not really reflective thorough understanding binding
globulins work, remember, binding globulins aren't soak
testosterone just make hard free testosterone know, make

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone

low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject

testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone

powerful effects light can sex steroid hormones, need understand
seasonal breeding animals, now, humans not seasonal breeders,
understand biology light impacts various neurotransmitters hormones,
set deep understanding light-
viewing behavior. several species animals, many species animals, fact, like
rabbits fox, various mustelids, like ferrets ermines, change pellage


color across seasons, might kind duh, fox winter often white
light gray, animals will brown darker-colored summertime
spring months. Now, animals breed spring, shut
breeding, actually shut ovulation, often shut testosterone
production winter months, right now just correlating color fur
tendency breed, tendency breed, know, going related levels
sex steroid hormones, estrogen testosterone. Now, two things
linked? Well, turns dopamine link them, dopamine
precursor, precursor tyrosine, amino acid, comes food,
dopamine levels high, mentioned before, tendency
gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone,
hormones come hypothalamic-pituitary axis stimulate estrogen
testosterone release ovary testes, dopamine basically increases that.
precursor dopamine tyrosine, precursor lot melanin-
producing elements cells give pigmentation, including hair, tyrosine
tyrosinase, enzyme, yes, amino acid-based pathway, many
enzymes devoted dopamine dopamine increasing sex steroid
hormones devoted giving pigmentation hair skin,
summer months, days longer, animals breeding more, also
winter months days shorter, animals breeding less, also
humans, many people, not all, feel elevation mood spring summer
months amount sunlight getting increased relative
winter months. Now, may saying, "I love fall, love winter,"
sensitivity light dopamine systems strong genetic component,
go areas world, relatives Scandinavian,
areas Scandinavia, people know kind seasonal affective disorder,
kind seasonal depression people get sadder quiescent
winter, actually less going out, therefore, less sexual behavior,
less partying things sort, people will say, "No, winter
months, feel great "and love holidays around winter," et cetera, lot
variation, general, pathway following, increased viewing sunlight,
eyes, not skin, increased viewing sunlight increases
dopamine levels brain, increased dopamine levels animals humans
increases amount melanocytes activity melanin-producing


cells, give pigmentation skin hair, indirectly, increase amount
testosterone estrogen, thereby, reproductive behavior, feelings well-being,
social interactions, reductions anxiety, et cetera, make sense
based talked already terms biology impact
steroid hormones various aspects mind body.
translate protocol? translates protocol of, want optimize
testosterone estrogen, need get light-viewing behavior correct, not
just optimizing sleep, also important, getting sufficient
amount light eyes sufficient levels dopamine, simple
protocols reviewed before, means getting anywhere 2 10
minutes bright light exposure eyes early day, not sufficient

people not getting enough sleep, getting much light eyes
middle night well, study not completed yet,
two studies published "Cell" "Neuron," Cell Press journals, excellent journals,
showing viewing bright light eyes middle circadian night
detrimental effect dopamine, therefore detrimental effect things like

get things like light-viewing behavior right, bright light early day
throughout day great, view much bright light, ideally sunlight, can,
much safely can, obviously don't want burn retinas damage

light eyes not just adjusting sleep-wake rhythms, also
optimizing sex steroid hormones, avoiding bright light middle night
not just not disrupting sleep, also optimizing sex steroid
hormones, now understand bit sex steroid hormones work
powerful reducing anxiety effects,
straightforward do, hopefully inspired get light-viewing behavior
breathing behavior correct. fact, thinking tools,

01:04:39 Specificity Hormone Effects

many people suffering low levels estrogen want higher levels
low levels testosterone want higher levels, just getting breathing
light-viewing behavior, will indirectly support sleep behavior, can huge
positive effect levels sex steroid hormones. can already anticipate hearing
this, might wonder whether not viewing light going to, instance, increase
testosterone lot fact want estrogen increased, going
increase estrogen lot want testosterone increased, everything
describing people, regardless chromosomal gonadal background,
trying basically offer information one swoop, basically,
somebody naturally ovaries higher levels estrogen
testosterone, viewing bright light early day, dopamine's effects,
going promote estrogen subtle increases testosterone, whereas
somebody starts off testosterone lower estrogen, somebody
presumably testes maybe supplementing testosterone
sources whatever reason, bright-light viewing going increase testosterone
estrogen parallel, still going maintain ratio testosterone
estrogen, short, don't worry going increase wrong
hormone, optimizing ratios hormones

01:06:03 Temperature: Cold & Hot Gonads

already have. Okay, talked breathing, talked light,
talk third element seems excitement lately
reasons can actually pretty profound influences hormone


levels, heat cold, always, rather just offer tool, going
tell underlying science relates naturally occurring phenomena because,
understanding understanding mechanism, going far
better position understand tools mechanisms might want
adjust life. now understand relationship light, day
length, dopamine, hormone levels, everyone realize temperature
day length linked, sure say that, probably thinking, "Oh,
course." summer, sunlight, days longer, nights shorter,
general, tends warmer out, winter, nights longer, days
shorter, tends colder out, winter months, testosterone estrogen
tend lower many animals humans, summer months,
role dopamine promoting sex steroid hormones, days longer
warmer, humans tend make estrogen testosterone relative
months year. Now, effects can somewhat weak modulated
opposed seasonally breeding animals really dramatic, okay?
point temperature day length sunlight, intimately related
systems evolved in, right? artificial light
artificial heating artificial cooling, biology evolved systems
temperature, day length, hormones correlated one another,
nowadays, lot interest using cold way stimulate testosterone,
mainly sports community, particular, bodybuilding community,
always seeking ways maximize testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, keep
estrogen minimum required still libido still skin elasticity
also walk around Saran-wrap skin, kind extreme stuff happens
led recent movement where, believe not, heard couldn't
believe it, went checked, although didn't buy them, Amazon, can
actually find, literally underwear ice packs, think ice pack
underwear, people making cold level gonads
order try increase testosterone libido, sounds pretty crazy, believe
not, things like ice baths cold showers can positive effects sex
steroid hormones, testosterone, mainly males, estrogen, mainly females,
might say, "Wait, thought cold "makes reproductive axis kind shut
bit "or reduces testosterone estrogen," turns not actually cold
effects people, things like ice bath, cold showers, cold-water


swims, ice underwear whatever are, can't believe actually exist,
exist, happens rebound vasodilation cooling,
cooling causes vasoconstriction, cooling, rebound
vasodilation infusion blood gonads. also effect
neural, let explain works studies
this, none looking frozen underwear, looked cold
exposure levels androgens estrogens, kind interesting,
remember gonad, ovaries testes heavily vascularized.
Remember, even level brain, GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
comes neurons that, believe not, start off nose early development,
migrate hypothalamus. not making up, started off nose
migrated hypothalamus. neurons extend processes, call axons,
pituitary release GnRH pituitary. lot vascularization
within pituitary, now hormones, GnRH, can stimulate follicle-stimulating
hormone, luteinizing hormone, released travel bloodstream.
hormones reach ovary testes, get ovary
testes, way vascular system, people forget,
vascular system constricted dilated vessels controlled neurons,
right? discussed discussion stress stress episode,
well-known neuroscientists best way shut neurons cool them,
lot examples scientific literature, people aren't
aware not digging around method section papers,
want shut neurons, can things like inject drugs will that,
like lidocaine, know, stuff makes numb dentist, can use
different inhibitors, one best ways experimentally just cool
neurons, make neurons cold, temperature dependence
neurons can active can't, neurons shut down,
plausible explanation cold exposure, either 1 10-minute ice bath
cold shower ice underpants thing, increase testosterone increase
estrogen cooling neurons control vasoconstriction vasodilation
shutting entry blood, least reducing it, hormones
gonad, gonad surrounding area heats again,
getting rebound hyper-vasodilation delivers excessive levels of, not excessive,
increased levels GnRH hormones carriers carrier proteins


forth stimulate gonad release testosterone
stimulate gonad release estrogen, plausible explanation can
come with, aren't lot studies looking direct effects temperature
gonad, going difficult study carry case unless
done vitro dish, hard eliminate things like
vasoconstriction vasodilation, put simply, don't know whether not cold
heat directly affect production testosterone estrogen, know cold
heat can modulate those, probably indirect mechanisms like controlling
amount blood flow way shutting activating neurons. Now,
lot lore around heating gonads much, actually whole set
pseudoscience webpages saying, "Well, want girl, "you
conceive child room temperature, "and want boy, "you
conceive child room temperature." don't think really firm scientific
evidence that, either one, interesting literature temperature
dependence production hormones, think probably relates
mechanisms vasodilation neural control vasodilation, course,
excessively high heat not good testes, sperm production, sperm
health, sperm sorts proteins cap, things like pentraxins things
cause swim faster expressed properly right
locations, heat actually alters location function lot proteins,
heat sensitive, excessive heat truly not good fertility,
may independent heat's roles promoting estrogen testosterone. Okay,
now talked breathing,

01:14:10 Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing

light, temperature, talked parenthood, talked competition,
talked pheromone effects, now talk particular forms
exercise modulate steroid hormones, going talk
various supplements, reference testosterone reference
estrogen. now talk exercise various forms, weight training,
endurance work, weight training failure, less intense weight training can impact
testosterone levels, want remind talking testosterone
males females, based know earlier episode,


testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided
optimal range. look web, people will say, "Oh, know,
"testosterone increased weight training, "you want big, heavy
compound movements," squats deadlifts chins things sort,
scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,
squat? squat loading bunch weights bar then, know,
sitting down, essentially, standing again. deadlift?
lifting heavy weights ground. increase testosterone, right?
often not discussed weight training even exercise science
community, actually stimulate release testosterone adrenals
and/or testes, one it, adrenals testes both? often not
discussed, neuroscientist, kinds things think
think always genes don't create behavior, immune systems don't know
activated, lungs don't know inhale exhale, hearts don't know beat
except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen
receptor content, meaning testosterone derivatives, receptor content following
heavy-resistance exercise, find examples that, instance, know,
muscle biopsies, can actually see receptor increases, looking either high-
volume low-volume really intense exercise, can find lot not lot
mechanism nervous system this, reason want
know can potentially build better protocols figure
exactly movements triggering increases androgen receptors
testosterone. interesting start digging mechanistic
studies, find heavy weight training, weight training
sets done anywhere kind one eight rep range, translates
differently depending ratio muscle fiber type forth, basically
people working anywhere like, 70% 95% maximum, sometimes
even going right one-repetition maximum, really kind max effort,
find using nervous system way moving heavy loads,
translate recruitment high-threshold motor units, muscle


physiologists, rule muscle physiology neuron recruitment
moving muscles basically use minimum number motor units neurons
activate muscle possibly can, loads increase, recruit
neurons, always hear recruiting muscle fibers, really, recruiting
neurons recruit muscle fibers, find heavy weight
training, not weight training failure completion repetition impossible,
leads greatest increases testosterone. Now, sure bunch
exercise jockeys going come bunch things where,
oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training
heavy loads, anywhere one-rep maximum somewhere six eight
repetition range, males females, increases testosterone significantly,
day, sometimes 48 hours, studies found seem
hold rigor weight based published opposed
published journal "Never Heard It," published good-quality exercise
physiology journals, instance, paper Ratamess, R-A-T-A-M-E-S-S et al.,
published 2005, talks modulations androgen receptor content
heavy resistance exercise, looks going failure not failure, work
Izquierdo et al. published 2006, "Differential Effects Strength Training "Leading
Failure Versus Not Failure "on Hormonal Responses, Strength, Power Gains,"
know, lot studies will certainly put links
caption, many actually include Duncan French, runs UFC training
center privilege meeting discussing before,
well authors, course, point fact something
engagement neurons recruit high-threshold motor units muscle
moving heavy loads, not failure, provide sort feedback signal,
either gonad produce testosterone, increasing activity
receptors body. Now, say that? Well, puzzle, right?
particular movement, just like interacting child, increasing
decreasing testosterone? kind fundamental question mechanistic
level, answered question child-rearing, probably something
smell pheromones, although sure cues well,
clearly influence hard work neural level muscular level


increasing testosterone, also clearly effect working hard
presumably increasing cortisol much, although speculating there, terms
reducing testosterone, reason getting nitty-gritty
ultimately, really like understand, optimal protocols? know,
literature, hear, move heavy objects increase testosterone,
will converted powerful androgen, DHT, 5-alpha reductase et
cetera, really don't understand yet particular behaviors increase
testosterone whether not modulating receptors
modulating testosterone release directly, presumably, testosterone release directly
sensitivity receptors, muscle physiology studies
able find point to, basically boils particular set protocols
want increase testosterone, whatever reason, weight training heavy
loads not failure seems best-supported, least scientifically supported,
solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase
decrease androgen levels whether not combine endurance activity
weight training, whether not effect endurance activity first
second, takeaway endurance activity, performed first,
leads decreases testosterone weight training session compared
weight training session done first followed endurance activity, words,
want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something
recommending,

01:24:41 Estrogen & Menopause: Compounds May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms

just justifying rationale endurance athlete want
all. now switch talking estrogen, many people
trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood
mainly ovary now depleted estrogen production own,
eggs not produced, depleted, et cetera. menopause
characterized variety symptoms, multifaceted, probably deserves
entire episode own, things like hot flashes, things like mood swings, things like
headaches, particular migraine headaches, can lot brain fog, can
very, disruptive people. Now, sometimes hear andropause,


thought kind analog menopause, menopause certain
characteristics make robust phenomenon women, whereas
men, andropause going sometimes happen, sometimes won't, fact, without going
details graphs data, clear, mentioned earlier,
men maintain levels circulating androgens quite high, even similar
puberty teen years 20s, well 60s, 70s, 80s
optimizing lot things, probably genetics plays role well,
whereas males won't, within female population, population individuals
ovaries, stereotyped characteristic reduction estrogen
levels number eggs becomes depleted, think
menopause. various things one can menopause? Well, one
common ones physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen,
hormone therapy somebody takes either oral estrogen use
patch pellet, way secrete estradiol system, varying
success depending individual, people respond well it, people
really challenges it, lot side effects associated
people, not others, addition, concern always supplementing
estrogen breast cancer background family concern
breast cancer reason lot cancers estrogen-dependent,
drugs like tamoxifen anastrozole drugs block either
aromatase block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly initially developed,
see lot internet, again, sports folks trying increase
testosterone, reduce estrogen, remember, drugs initially developed
ways prevent estrogen binding estrogen receptor cancer treatments,
want clear said many times, always put caption
episode, course, not physician, not M.D., don't prescribe
anything, professor profess things, translate scientific literature
point might useful avenues exploration, just
information purposes, definitely talk doctor anything
talking now episode, matter. look literature
menopause outside just standard estrogen therapy, interesting
compounds used supported quality peer-
reviewed studies, again, refer amazing website,
examine.com, can put essentially condition supplement,


will point human effect matrix, not animal studies, human studies
explored things. Now, huge variety won't go
them, pro-estrogenic compounds shown
powerful context menopause, well conditions estrogen
lower one like, include description literature, get
moment, something like black cohosh, think correct pronunciation,
literally word black C-O-H-O-S-H, interesting, 13
peer-reviewed studies reached prominence kind commercial

increases estrogen, seem real effect, significant
placebo effect, also significant placebo effect studies
well, interesting look studies many

almost lead modest increases estrogen modest decreases
menopause-related symptoms. Now, additional details studies,
generally carried women age 45 64, cases, look specifically
women clinically obese overweight, although not always, subject size
pools pretty big, know, anywhere 50 87, decent size, 132
subjects, et cetera, look like quality studies, basically point
fact black cohosh can modest effect improving menopause symptoms.
one Panax ginseng, P-N-A-A-X ginseng, shown decrease

actually, minor effects, things like, names little hard pronounce,
forgive me, things like Valeriana officinalis shown can

might worth exploring, again, discuss doctor,
100-subject plus, age 45 64 individuals, double-blind placebo-controlled studies
showed significant modest effects. one substance gallery

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper
ratios, things call sort usual suspects, vitamin D,
important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want
understand exactly negative effects not sufficient zinc
magnesium, levels might actually be, paper available,
can go PubMed, can't pronounce last name, sorry, looks like
Wrzosek, W-R-Z-O-S-E-K, hope didn't butcher badly, Wrzosek et al.
2020 "Endocrinology Metabolism Review," recent paper good,
peer-reviewed journal talks mainly hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal


axis sex steroid hormones negatively impacted deficiencies
magnesium, deficiencies vitamin D, deficiencies zinc, however, doesn't
point levels one take order optimize, doesn't say take X
amount zinc X amount magnesium X amount vitamin D, information,
context-dependent individual-dependent, highly recommend go
examine.com, can put zinc magnesium vitamin D, will give
ranges dosages supported specific studies, again, information
completely free you, useful figuring out. personally
supplemented zinc, magnesium, vitamin D years, many people
well, question always, much? proponent
getting blood work done know whether not androgen

takeaway studies looking deficiencies cause terms deficits
testosterone estrogen really point direction of, make sure getting
adequate zinc, magnesium, D3 unless want steroid hormone levels
reduced whatever reason.

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing
hormone neurons, neurons within hypothalamus communicate
pituitary, fact, people take large amounts opioids, even take low levels
opioids long periods time, will develop sorts endocrine syndromes,
shown again, gynecomastia, male breast development males,
disruptions ovary females, really quite terrible situation, excessive
opioids problematic sex steroid hormones, don't think anyone will
trouble finding literature that, can just go PubMed, can put opioids,
testosterone, opioids, estrogen, major effect actually way

testosterone estrogen release.

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual
consumption bull testes, can go Amazon right now, certainly don't suggest
this, can actually buy ground testes cows, can
consume those, now, lot going broken gut, certainly not
suggesting that, just point huge vast literature,
actually dates back hundreds years even though testosterone wasn't discovered
long ago specific hormone molecule characterized resynthesized,
huge industry powerful effects has, likewise estrogen,
development birth control pill made possible understanding
structure estrogen estradiol, going talk birth control
works influence various pathways future episode,
supplement compounds supported scientific literature terms
ability adjust androgens,

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,
dramatic role creating kind masculinization brain prenatally, also
defines primary sex characteristic growth penis, et cetera, beyond
infancy early childhood later life, powerful effects creating balding,
beard growth, et cetera, much higher affinity androgen receptor
testosterone, creatine can increase DHT, means take creatine


DHT-susceptible, might experience hair loss,
heavily debated, creatine cause baldness? going depend, going
depend much 5-alpha reductase prone hair loss are,
people can take creatine without problem terms hair loss, people
cannot, start losing hair levels that, least them, aren't comfortable.
things can increase testosterone

01:40:14 Free Bound Testosterone: SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin), Tongat
Ali

way testosterone exists free bound form,
testosterone, molecule kind total testosterone, usually measured,
kind levels typically thrown around anywhere 300 900
kind natural range, supraphysiological, getting 1,200, 1,600
range, testosterone isn't just roaming around free blood, least
isn't, bound either sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG, albumin,
needed transporters get testosterone cells testosterone can
effects gene expression well pathways within cells, people
talk level free testosterone really important want
optimize free testosterone, little bit tricky statement, kind like,
true, yet, not really reflective thorough understanding binding
globulins work, remember, binding globulins aren't soak
testosterone just make hard free testosterone know, make

supplements, particular, tongkat ali, is, name, something
called tongkat ali, sometimes called, forgive hard pronounce,


Eurycoma longifolia Jack, always seem names kind allude
androgenic features, like don't know why, longifolia Jack, don't know, think kind
obvious sounds sort androgenic. shown several studies,
can find examine.com, can go PubMed like, looked
these, seem pro-fertility, pro-free testosterone, subtle

support freeing testosterone, again, freeing testosterone may
exactly want, just don't think demonize carrier proteins
like albumin SHBG, fact, albumin important testosterone able

01:47:43 Ecdysteroids: Mimic Mammalian Hormones

looking kind people talking about, also
mean scientific literature, one things new me, anyway, probably
not new lot gym rats there, people spend lot time
YouTube videos talking androgens, these, forgive butchering name
again, ecdysteroids, ecdysteroids molecules come things like
spinach, believe not, lot similarity cholesterol molecule, one
discussed lot right now something called turkesterone, wish

anything turkeys? don't know called turkesterone, perhaps
someone will know. case, ecdysteroids similar enough cholesterol,
remember, cholesterol precursor testosterone, cortisol, estrogen,

actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone
background menstrual cycle really going disrupt way things interact,
just exquisite feedback loop, not saying don't that,
definitely want aware doing, blood draws one way
that, monitoring cycles ovulating females another way that, males,
good window going testosterone, DHT, aromatase,
estradiol, LH, et cetera, just vital, really part parcel practice
thinking optimizing incredible things call sex steroid hormones,

01:57:18 Additional Compounds, Liver Toxicity, Overall Milieu

day length linked, sure say that, probably thinking, "Oh,
course." summer, sunlight, days longer, nights shorter,
general, tends warmer out, winter, nights longer, days

remember gonad, ovaries testes heavily vascularized.
Remember, even level brain, GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

want shut neurons, can things like inject drugs will that,
like lidocaine, know, stuff makes numb dentist, can use

lot lore around heating gonads much, actually whole set
pseudoscience webpages saying, "Well, want girl, "you

now talked breathing,

01:14:10 Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing

light, temperature, talked parenthood, talked competition,
talked pheromone effects, now talk particular forms
exercise modulate steroid hormones, going talk
various supplements, reference testosterone reference
estrogen. now talk exercise various forms, weight training,
endurance work, weight training failure, less intense weight training can impact
testosterone levels, want remind talking testosterone
males females, based know earlier episode,


testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided
optimal range. look web, people will say, "Oh, know,
"testosterone increased weight training, "you want big, heavy
compound movements," squats deadlifts chins things sort,
scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,
squat? squat loading bunch weights bar then, know,
sitting down, essentially, standing again. deadlift?
lifting heavy weights ground. increase testosterone, right?
often not discussed weight training even exercise science
community, actually stimulate release testosterone adrenals
and/or testes, one it, adrenals testes both? often not
discussed, neuroscientist, kinds things think
think always genes don't create behavior, immune systems don't know
activated, lungs don't know inhale exhale, hearts don't know beat
except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen
receptor content, meaning testosterone derivatives, receptor content following
heavy-resistance exercise, find examples that, instance, know,
muscle biopsies, can actually see receptor increases, looking either high-
volume low-volume really intense exercise, can find lot not lot
mechanism nervous system this, reason want
know can potentially build better protocols figure
exactly movements triggering increases androgen receptors
testosterone. interesting start digging mechanistic
studies, find heavy weight training, weight training
sets done anywhere kind one eight rep range, translates
differently depending ratio muscle fiber type forth, basically
people working anywhere like, 70% 95% maximum, sometimes
even going right one-repetition maximum, really kind max effort,
find using nervous system way moving heavy loads,
translate recruitment high-threshold motor units, muscle


physiologists, rule muscle physiology neuron recruitment
moving muscles basically use minimum number motor units neurons
activate muscle possibly can, loads increase, recruit
neurons, always hear recruiting muscle fibers, really, recruiting
neurons recruit muscle fibers, find heavy weight
training, not weight training failure completion repetition impossible,
leads greatest increases testosterone. Now, sure bunch
exercise jockeys going come bunch things where,
oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training
heavy loads, anywhere one-rep maximum somewhere six eight
repetition range, males females, increases testosterone significantly,
day, sometimes 48 hours, studies found seem
hold rigor weight based published opposed
published journal "Never Heard It," published good-quality exercise
physiology journals, instance, paper Ratamess, R-A-T-A-M-E-S-S et al.,
published 2005, talks modulations androgen receptor content
heavy resistance exercise, looks going failure not failure, work
Izquierdo et al. published 2006, "Differential Effects Strength Training "Leading
Failure Versus Not Failure "on Hormonal Responses, Strength, Power Gains,"
know, lot studies will certainly put links
caption, many actually include Duncan French, runs UFC training
center privilege meeting discussing before,
well authors, course, point fact something
engagement neurons recruit high-threshold motor units muscle
moving heavy loads, not failure, provide sort feedback signal,
either gonad produce testosterone, increasing activity
receptors body. Now, say that? Well, puzzle, right?
particular movement, just like interacting child, increasing
decreasing testosterone? kind fundamental question mechanistic
level, answered question child-rearing, probably something
smell pheromones, although sure cues well,
clearly influence hard work neural level muscular level


increasing testosterone, also clearly effect working hard
presumably increasing cortisol much, although speculating there, terms
reducing testosterone, reason getting nitty-gritty
ultimately, really like understand, optimal protocols? know,
literature, hear, move heavy objects increase testosterone,
will converted powerful androgen, DHT, 5-alpha reductase et
cetera, really don't understand yet particular behaviors increase
testosterone whether not modulating receptors
modulating testosterone release directly, presumably, testosterone release directly
sensitivity receptors, muscle physiology studies
able find point to, basically boils particular set protocols
want increase testosterone, whatever reason, weight training heavy
loads not failure seems best-supported, least scientifically supported,
solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase
decrease androgen levels whether not combine endurance activity
weight training, whether not effect endurance activity first
second, takeaway endurance activity, performed first,
leads decreases testosterone weight training session compared
weight training session done first followed endurance activity, words,
want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something
recommending,

01:24:41 Estrogen & Menopause: Compounds May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms

just justifying rationale endurance athlete want
all. now switch talking estrogen, many people
trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood
mainly ovary now depleted estrogen production own,
eggs not produced, depleted, et cetera. menopause
characterized variety symptoms, multifaceted, probably deserves
entire episode own, things like hot flashes, things like mood swings, things like
headaches, particular migraine headaches, can lot brain fog, can
very, disruptive people. Now, sometimes hear andropause,


thought kind analog menopause, menopause certain
characteristics make robust phenomenon women, whereas
men, andropause going sometimes happen, sometimes won't, fact, without going
details graphs data, clear, mentioned earlier,
men maintain levels circulating androgens quite high, even similar
puberty teen years 20s, well 60s, 70s, 80s
optimizing lot things, probably genetics plays role well,
whereas males won't, within female population, population individuals
ovaries, stereotyped characteristic reduction estrogen
levels number eggs becomes depleted, think
menopause. various things one can menopause? Well, one
common ones physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen,
hormone therapy somebody takes either oral estrogen use
patch pellet, way secrete estradiol system, varying
success depending individual, people respond well it, people
really challenges it, lot side effects associated
people, not others, addition, concern always supplementing
estrogen breast cancer background family concern
breast cancer reason lot cancers estrogen-dependent,
drugs like tamoxifen anastrozole drugs block either
aromatase block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly initially developed,
see lot internet, again, sports folks trying increase
testosterone, reduce estrogen, remember, drugs initially developed
ways prevent estrogen binding estrogen receptor cancer treatments,
want clear said many times, always put caption
episode, course, not physician, not M.D., don't prescribe
anything, professor profess things, translate scientific literature
point might useful avenues exploration, just
information purposes, definitely talk doctor anything
talking now episode, matter. look literature
menopause outside just standard estrogen therapy, interesting
compounds used supported quality peer-

examine.com, can put essentially condition supplement,


will point human effect matrix, not animal studies, human studies
explored things. Now, huge variety won't go
them, pro-estrogenic compounds shown
powerful context menopause, well conditions estrogen
lower one like, include description literature, get
moment, something like black cohosh, think correct pronunciation,
literally word black C-O-H-O-S-H, interesting, 13
peer-reviewed studies reached prominence kind commercial

increases estrogen, seem real effect, significant
placebo effect, also significant placebo effect studies
well, interesting look studies many
carried period six-plus months, double-blind studies, et cetera,
almost lead modest increases estrogen modest decreases
menopause-related symptoms. Now, additional details studies,
generally carried women age 45 64, cases, look specifically
women clinically obese overweight, although not always, subject size
pools pretty big, know, anywhere 50 87, decent size, 132
subjects, et cetera, look like quality studies, basically point
fact black cohosh can modest effect improving menopause symptoms.
one Panax ginseng, P-N-A-A-X ginseng, shown decrease
symptoms associated menopause, mostly related libido, although

actually, minor effects, things like, names little hard pronounce,
forgive me, things like Valeriana officinalis shown can

might worth exploring, again, discuss doctor,
100-subject plus, age 45 64 individuals, double-blind placebo-controlled studies
showed significant modest effects. one substance gallery

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper
ratios, things call sort usual suspects, vitamin D,
important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want
understand exactly negative effects not sufficient zinc
magnesium, levels might actually be, paper available,
can go PubMed, can't pronounce last name, sorry, looks like
Wrzosek, W-R-Z-O-S-E-K, hope didn't butcher badly, Wrzosek et al.
2020 "Endocrinology Metabolism Review," recent paper good,
peer-reviewed journal talks mainly hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal


axis sex steroid hormones negatively impacted deficiencies
magnesium, deficiencies vitamin D, deficiencies zinc, however, doesn't
point levels one take order optimize, doesn't say take X
amount zinc X amount magnesium X amount vitamin D, information,
context-dependent individual-dependent, highly recommend go
examine.com, can put zinc magnesium vitamin D, will give
ranges dosages supported specific studies, again, information
completely free you, useful figuring out. personally
supplemented zinc, magnesium, vitamin D years, many people
well, question always, much? proponent
getting blood work done know whether not androgen
levels, well things like vitamin D levels, et cetera, sufficiently high,
takeaway studies looking deficiencies cause terms deficits
testosterone estrogen really point direction of, make sure getting
adequate zinc, magnesium, D3 unless want steroid hormone levels
reduced whatever reason.

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing
hormone neurons, neurons within hypothalamus communicate
pituitary, fact, people take large amounts opioids, even take low levels
opioids long periods time, will develop sorts endocrine syndromes,
shown again, gynecomastia, male breast development males,
disruptions ovary females, really quite terrible situation, excessive
opioids problematic sex steroid hormones, don't think anyone will
trouble finding literature that, can just go PubMed, can put opioids,
testosterone, opioids, estrogen, major effect actually way
hypothalamus shut production GnRH, hormone stimulates


testosterone estrogen release.

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual
consumption bull testes, can go Amazon right now, certainly don't suggest
this, can actually buy ground testes cows, can
consume those, now, lot going broken gut, certainly not
suggesting that, just point huge vast literature,
actually dates back hundreds years even though testosterone wasn't discovered
long ago specific hormone molecule characterized resynthesized,
huge industry powerful effects has, likewise estrogen,
development birth control pill made possible understanding
structure estrogen estradiol, going talk birth control
works influence various pathways future episode,
supplement compounds supported scientific literature terms
ability adjust androgens,

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,
dramatic role creating kind masculinization brain prenatally, also
defines primary sex characteristic growth penis, et cetera, beyond
infancy early childhood later life, powerful effects creating balding,
beard growth, et cetera, much higher affinity androgen receptor
testosterone, creatine can increase DHT, means take creatine


DHT-susceptible, might experience hair loss,
heavily debated, creatine cause baldness? going depend, going
depend much 5-alpha reductase prone hair loss are,
people can take creatine without problem terms hair loss, people
cannot, start losing hair levels that, least them, aren't comfortable.
things can increase testosterone

01:40:14 Free Bound Testosterone: SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin), Tongat
Ali

way testosterone exists free bound form,
testosterone, molecule kind total testosterone, usually measured,
kind levels typically thrown around anywhere 300 900
kind natural range, supraphysiological, getting 1,200, 1,600
range, testosterone isn't just roaming around free blood, least
isn't, bound either sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG, albumin,
needed transporters get testosterone cells testosterone can
effects gene expression well pathways within cells, people
talk level free testosterone really important want
optimize free testosterone, little bit tricky statement, kind like,
true, yet, not really reflective thorough understanding binding
globulins work, remember, binding globulins aren't soak
testosterone just make hard free testosterone know, make
gains gym whatever is, increases libido, actually
transport testosterone specific tissues, shuttle specific tissues set
rate bound unbound testosterone not unbound once,
know, always interesting look literature see everyone wants
free testosterone can work, sex hormone binding globulin can bind
much testosterone point negative effects libido
muscle growth fat loss things sort, true males females,
can exactly supposed do, shuttling testosterone
proper tissues organs effects, including brain.
supplements, particular, tongkat ali, is, name, something

body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed

excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase

going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every

reduced whatever reason.

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing
hormone neurons, neurons within hypothalamus communicate
pituitary, fact, people take large amounts opioids, even take low levels
opioids long periods time, will develop sorts endocrine syndromes,
shown again, gynecomastia, male breast development males,
disruptions ovary females, really quite terrible situation, excessive
opioids problematic sex steroid hormones, don't think anyone will
trouble finding literature that, can just go PubMed, can put opioids,
testosterone, opioids, estrogen, major effect actually way

testosterone estrogen release.

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual
consumption bull testes, can go Amazon right now, certainly don't suggest
this, can actually buy ground testes cows, can
consume those, now, lot going broken gut, certainly not
suggesting that, just point huge vast literature,
actually dates back hundreds years even though testosterone wasn't discovered
long ago specific hormone molecule characterized resynthesized,

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,
dramatic role creating kind masculinization brain prenatally, also
defines primary sex characteristic growth penis, et cetera, beyond
infancy early childhood later life, powerful effects creating balding,
beard growth, et cetera, much higher affinity androgen receptor

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone
background menstrual cycle really going disrupt way things interact,
just exquisite feedback loop, not saying don't that,
definitely want aware doing, blood draws one way

except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen

oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment

solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase

weight training, whether not effect endurance activity first
second, takeaway endurance activity, performed first,
leads decreases testosterone weight training session compared
weight training session done first followed endurance activity, words,
want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something
recommending,

eggs not produced, depleted, et cetera. menopause
characterized variety symptoms, multifaceted, probably deserves
entire episode own, things like hot flashes, things like mood swings, things like

very, disruptive people. Now, sometimes hear andropause,


thought kind analog menopause, menopause certain

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper
ratios, things call sort usual suspects, vitamin D,
important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want
understand exactly negative effects not sufficient zinc
magnesium, levels might actually be, paper available,
can go PubMed, can't pronounce last name, sorry, looks like
Wrzosek, W-R-Z-O-S-E-K, hope didn't butcher badly, Wrzosek et al.
2020 "Endocrinology Metabolism Review," recent paper good,

completely free you, useful figuring out. personally
supplemented zinc, magnesium, vitamin D years, many people
well, question always, much? proponent
getting blood work done know whether not androgen

takeaway studies looking deficiencies cause terms deficits
testosterone estrogen really point direction of, make sure getting
adequate zinc, magnesium, D3 unless want steroid hormone levels
reduced whatever reason.

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone

low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject

testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone

males females, based know earlier episode,


testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided
optimal range. look web, people will say, "Oh, know,
"testosterone increased weight training, "you want big, heavy

scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,

except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen

exercise jockeys going come bunch things where,
oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training
heavy loads, anywhere one-rep maximum somewhere six eight

smell pheromones, although sure cues well,
clearly influence hard work neural level muscular level


increasing testosterone, also clearly effect working hard
presumably increasing cortisol much, although speculating there, terms
reducing testosterone, reason getting nitty-gritty
ultimately, really like understand, optimal protocols? know,

modulating testosterone release directly, presumably, testosterone release directly

solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase

weight training, whether not effect endurance activity first
second, takeaway endurance activity, performed first,
leads decreases testosterone weight training session compared
weight training session done first followed endurance activity, words,
want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something
recommending,

01:24:41 Estrogen & Menopause: Compounds May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms

trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood
mainly ovary now depleted estrogen production own,
eggs not produced, depleted, et cetera. menopause
characterized variety symptoms, multifaceted, probably deserves
entire episode own, things like hot flashes, things like mood swings, things like

generally carried women age 45 64, cases, look specifically
women clinically obese overweight, although not always, subject size
pools pretty big, know, anywhere 50 87, decent size, 132
subjects, et cetera, look like quality studies, basically point
fact black cohosh can modest effect improving menopause symptoms.
one Panax ginseng, P-N-A-A-X ginseng, shown decrease

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper
ratios, things call sort usual suspects, vitamin D,
important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want
understand exactly negative effects not sufficient zinc
magnesium, levels might actually be, paper available,
can go PubMed, can't pronounce last name, sorry, looks like
Wrzosek, W-R-Z-O-S-E-K, hope didn't butcher badly, Wrzosek et al.
2020 "Endocrinology Metabolism Review," recent paper good,
peer-reviewed journal talks mainly hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal


axis sex steroid hormones negatively impacted deficiencies
magnesium, deficiencies vitamin D, deficiencies zinc, however, doesn't
point levels one take order optimize, doesn't say take X
amount zinc X amount magnesium X amount vitamin D, information,
context-dependent individual-dependent, highly recommend go
examine.com, can put zinc magnesium vitamin D, will give
ranges dosages supported specific studies, again, information
completely free you, useful figuring out. personally
supplemented zinc, magnesium, vitamin D years, many people
well, question always, much? proponent
getting blood work done know whether not androgen

takeaway studies looking deficiencies cause terms deficits
testosterone estrogen really point direction of, make sure getting
adequate zinc, magnesium, D3 unless want steroid hormone levels
reduced whatever reason.

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing
hormone neurons, neurons within hypothalamus communicate
pituitary, fact, people take large amounts opioids, even take low levels
opioids long periods time, will develop sorts endocrine syndromes,
shown again, gynecomastia, male breast development males,

testosterone estrogen release.

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual
consumption bull testes, can go Amazon right now, certainly don't suggest
this, can actually buy ground testes cows, can
consume those, now, lot going broken gut, certainly not
suggesting that, just point huge vast literature,
actually dates back hundreds years even though testosterone wasn't discovered
long ago specific hormone molecule characterized resynthesized,
huge industry powerful effects has, likewise estrogen,
development birth control pill made possible understanding

supplement compounds supported scientific literature terms
ability adjust androgens,

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,
dramatic role creating kind masculinization brain prenatally, also
defines primary sex characteristic growth penis, et cetera, beyond
infancy early childhood later life, powerful effects creating balding,
beard growth, et cetera, much higher affinity androgen receptor

people can take creatine without problem terms hair loss, people
cannot, start losing hair levels that, least them, aren't comfortable.
things can increase testosterone

01:40:14 Free Bound Testosterone: SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin), Tongat

talk level free testosterone really important want
optimize free testosterone, little bit tricky statement, kind like,
true, yet, not really reflective thorough understanding binding
globulins work, remember, binding globulins aren't soak

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone

endurance work, weight training failure, less intense weight training can impact
testosterone levels, want remind talking testosterone
males females, based know earlier episode,


testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided
optimal range. look web, people will say, "Oh, know,
"testosterone increased weight training, "you want big, heavy
compound movements," squats deadlifts chins things sort,
scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,
squat? squat loading bunch weights bar then, know,
sitting down, essentially, standing again. deadlift?

except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen

oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training

smell pheromones, although sure cues well,
clearly influence hard work neural level muscular level


increasing testosterone, also clearly effect working hard
presumably increasing cortisol much, although speculating there, terms
reducing testosterone, reason getting nitty-gritty
ultimately, really like understand, optimal protocols? know,

will converted powerful androgen, DHT, 5-alpha reductase et
cetera, really don't understand yet particular behaviors increase
testosterone whether not modulating receptors
modulating testosterone release directly, presumably, testosterone release directly

able find point to, basically boils particular set protocols

solution that, now, may not raise testosterone levels high want,

01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First Last?) Yes, Matters

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
several studies exploring whether not endurance activity can increase
decrease androgen levels whether not combine endurance activity
weight training, whether not effect endurance activity first
second, takeaway endurance activity, performed first,
leads decreases testosterone weight training session compared
weight training session done first followed endurance activity, words,
want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something
recommending,

01:24:41 Estrogen & Menopause: Compounds May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms

just justifying rationale endurance athlete want
all. now switch talking estrogen, many people
trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood
mainly ovary now depleted estrogen production own,
eggs not produced, depleted, et cetera. menopause
characterized variety symptoms, multifaceted, probably deserves
entire episode own, things like hot flashes, things like mood swings, things like
headaches, particular migraine headaches, can lot brain fog, can
very, disruptive people. Now, sometimes hear andropause,


thought kind analog menopause, menopause certain
characteristics make robust phenomenon women, whereas
men, andropause going sometimes happen, sometimes won't, fact, without going
details graphs data, clear, mentioned earlier,
men maintain levels circulating androgens quite high, even similar

optimizing lot things, probably genetics plays role well,
whereas males won't, within female population, population individuals
ovaries, stereotyped characteristic reduction estrogen

menopause. various things one can menopause? Well, one
common ones physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen,
hormone therapy somebody takes either oral estrogen use
patch pellet, way secrete estradiol system, varying
success depending individual, people respond well it, people
really challenges it, lot side effects associated
people, not others, addition, concern always supplementing

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper
ratios, things call sort usual suspects, vitamin D,
important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want
understand exactly negative effects not sufficient zinc
magnesium, levels might actually be, paper available,
can go PubMed, can't pronounce last name, sorry, looks like
Wrzosek, W-R-Z-O-S-E-K, hope didn't butcher badly, Wrzosek et al.
2020 "Endocrinology Metabolism Review," recent paper good,

completely free you, useful figuring out. personally
supplemented zinc, magnesium, vitamin D years, many people
well, question always, much? proponent
getting blood work done know whether not androgen

takeaway studies looking deficiencies cause terms deficits
testosterone estrogen really point direction of, make sure getting
adequate zinc, magnesium, D3 unless want steroid hormone levels
reduced whatever reason.

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone

testosterone can numerous positive effects males females provided

scientific studies? Like, actual basis this? just
take step back look perspective scientist, say, okay,
squat? squat loading bunch weights bar then, know,
sitting down, essentially, standing again. deadlift?

except information gets neurons, nervous system controls
that, really answer neural system related
particular types weight-bearing exercises. go literature, kind
hard find real mechanism, see lot effects, hear things like, androgen

oh, yeah, high volume this, training failure that, sure, willing
kind put things side side, adjust exogenous testosterone treatment
rest, done studies, find general weight training

definitely taking things correct direction. Now, many might
endurance athletes also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,

want optimize testosterone levels, seems case weight training first
cardio-type endurance activity afterward right order business. Now,
done separate days, doesn't seem effect, showed
no statistical interaction, seems going workout
episode move heavy loads first, cardiovascular exercise,
little bit data looking specifically endurance exercise impacts testosterone
derivatives, clear high-intensity interval training, sprinting et cetera,
somewhat mimics neural activity occurs moving heavy weight loads,
going increase testosterone ample evidence literature,


endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting
testosterone, don't worry cortisol-induced reductions testosterone,
can just clamp, keep testosterone levels high, not something
recommending,

characterized variety symptoms, multifaceted, probably deserves
entire episode own, things like hot flashes, things like mood swings, things like

very, disruptive people. Now, sometimes hear andropause,


thought kind analog menopause, menopause certain

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper
ratios, things call sort usual suspects, vitamin D,
important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want
understand exactly negative effects not sufficient zinc
magnesium, levels might actually be, paper available,
can go PubMed, can't pronounce last name, sorry, looks like
Wrzosek, W-R-Z-O-S-E-K, hope didn't butcher badly, Wrzosek et al.
2020 "Endocrinology Metabolism Review," recent paper good,
peer-reviewed journal talks mainly hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal


axis sex steroid hormones negatively impacted deficiencies
magnesium, deficiencies vitamin D, deficiencies zinc, however, doesn't
point levels one take order optimize, doesn't say take X
amount zinc X amount magnesium X amount vitamin D, information,
context-dependent individual-dependent, highly recommend go
examine.com, can put zinc magnesium vitamin D, will give
ranges dosages supported specific studies, again, information
completely free you, useful figuring out. personally
supplemented zinc, magnesium, vitamin D years, many people
well, question always, much? proponent
getting blood work done know whether not androgen
levels, well things like vitamin D levels, et cetera, sufficiently high,
takeaway studies looking deficiencies cause terms deficits
testosterone estrogen really point direction of, make sure getting
adequate zinc, magnesium, D3 unless want steroid hormone levels
reduced whatever reason.

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing
hormone neurons, neurons within hypothalamus communicate
pituitary, fact, people take large amounts opioids, even take low levels
opioids long periods time, will develop sorts endocrine syndromes,
shown again, gynecomastia, male breast development males,
disruptions ovary females, really quite terrible situation, excessive
opioids problematic sex steroid hormones, don't think anyone will
trouble finding literature that, can just go PubMed, can put opioids,
testosterone, opioids, estrogen, major effect actually way

testosterone estrogen release.

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual
consumption bull testes, can go Amazon right now, certainly don't suggest
this, can actually buy ground testes cows, can
consume those, now, lot going broken gut, certainly not
suggesting that, just point huge vast literature,
actually dates back hundreds years even though testosterone wasn't discovered
long ago specific hormone molecule characterized resynthesized,
huge industry powerful effects has, likewise estrogen,
development birth control pill made possible understanding

supplement compounds supported scientific literature terms
ability adjust androgens,

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,
dramatic role creating kind masculinization brain prenatally, also
defines primary sex characteristic growth penis, et cetera, beyond
infancy early childhood later life, powerful effects creating balding,
beard growth, et cetera, much higher affinity androgen receptor

DHT-susceptible, might experience hair loss,
heavily debated, creatine cause baldness? going depend, going
depend much 5-alpha reductase prone hair loss are,
people can take creatine without problem terms hair loss, people
cannot, start losing hair levels that, least them, aren't comfortable.
things can increase testosterone

01:40:14 Free Bound Testosterone: SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin), Tongat
Ali

way testosterone exists free bound form,
testosterone, molecule kind total testosterone, usually measured,
kind levels typically thrown around anywhere 300 900
kind natural range, supraphysiological, getting 1,200, 1,600
range, testosterone isn't just roaming around free blood, least
isn't, bound either sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG, albumin,
needed transporters get testosterone cells testosterone can
effects gene expression well pathways within cells, people
talk level free testosterone really important want
optimize free testosterone, little bit tricky statement, kind like,
true, yet, not really reflective thorough understanding binding
globulins work, remember, binding globulins aren't soak
testosterone just make hard free testosterone know, make

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone
background menstrual cycle really going disrupt way things interact,
just exquisite feedback loop, not saying don't that,
definitely want aware doing, blood draws one way
that, monitoring cycles ovulating females another way that, males,

trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood
mainly ovary now depleted estrogen production own,

characterized variety symptoms, multifaceted, probably deserves
entire episode own, things like hot flashes, things like mood swings, things like

very, disruptive people. Now, sometimes hear andropause,


thought kind analog menopause, menopause certain

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper
ratios, things call sort usual suspects, vitamin D,
important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want
understand exactly negative effects not sufficient zinc
magnesium, levels might actually be, paper available,
can go PubMed, can't pronounce last name, sorry, looks like
Wrzosek, W-R-Z-O-S-E-K, hope didn't butcher badly, Wrzosek et al.
2020 "Endocrinology Metabolism Review," recent paper good,
peer-reviewed journal talks mainly hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal


axis sex steroid hormones negatively impacted deficiencies
magnesium, deficiencies vitamin D, deficiencies zinc, however, doesn't
point levels one take order optimize, doesn't say take X
amount zinc X amount magnesium X amount vitamin D, information,
context-dependent individual-dependent, highly recommend go
examine.com, can put zinc magnesium vitamin D, will give
ranges dosages supported specific studies, again, information
completely free you, useful figuring out. personally
supplemented zinc, magnesium, vitamin D years, many people
well, question always, much? proponent
getting blood work done know whether not androgen

takeaway studies looking deficiencies cause terms deficits
testosterone estrogen really point direction of, make sure getting
adequate zinc, magnesium, D3 unless want steroid hormone levels
reduced whatever reason.

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing
hormone neurons, neurons within hypothalamus communicate
pituitary, fact, people take large amounts opioids, even take low levels
opioids long periods time, will develop sorts endocrine syndromes,
shown again, gynecomastia, male breast development males,
disruptions ovary females, really quite terrible situation, excessive

trouble finding literature that, can just go PubMed, can put opioids,
testosterone, opioids, estrogen, major effect actually way

testosterone estrogen release.

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual
consumption bull testes, can go Amazon right now, certainly don't suggest
this, can actually buy ground testes cows, can
consume those, now, lot going broken gut, certainly not
suggesting that, just point huge vast literature,

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,

way testosterone exists free bound form,
testosterone, molecule kind total testosterone, usually measured,
kind levels typically thrown around anywhere 300 900
kind natural range, supraphysiological, getting 1,200, 1,600
range, testosterone isn't just roaming around free blood, least
isn't, bound either sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG, albumin,
needed transporters get testosterone cells testosterone can
effects gene expression well pathways within cells, people
talk level free testosterone really important want
optimize free testosterone, little bit tricky statement, kind like,
true, yet, not really reflective thorough understanding binding
globulins work, remember, binding globulins aren't soak

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone
background menstrual cycle really going disrupt way things interact,
just exquisite feedback loop, not saying don't that,

hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase

episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-

actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one

needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just

meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting

01:24:41 Estrogen & Menopause: Compounds May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms

just justifying rationale endurance athlete want
all. now switch talking estrogen, many people
trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood
mainly ovary now depleted estrogen production own,
eggs not produced, depleted, et cetera. menopause
characterized variety symptoms, multifaceted, probably deserves
entire episode own, things like hot flashes, things like mood swings, things like
headaches, particular migraine headaches, can lot brain fog, can
very, disruptive people. Now, sometimes hear andropause,


thought kind analog menopause, menopause certain
characteristics make robust phenomenon women, whereas
men, andropause going sometimes happen, sometimes won't, fact, without going
details graphs data, clear, mentioned earlier,
men maintain levels circulating androgens quite high, even similar
puberty teen years 20s, well 60s, 70s, 80s
optimizing lot things, probably genetics plays role well,
whereas males won't, within female population, population individuals
ovaries, stereotyped characteristic reduction estrogen
levels number eggs becomes depleted, think
menopause. various things one can menopause? Well, one
common ones physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen,
hormone therapy somebody takes either oral estrogen use
patch pellet, way secrete estradiol system, varying
success depending individual, people respond well it, people
really challenges it, lot side effects associated
people, not others, addition, concern always supplementing
estrogen breast cancer background family concern
breast cancer reason lot cancers estrogen-dependent,
drugs like tamoxifen anastrozole drugs block either
aromatase block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly initially developed,
see lot internet, again, sports folks trying increase
testosterone, reduce estrogen, remember, drugs initially developed
ways prevent estrogen binding estrogen receptor cancer treatments,
want clear said many times, always put caption
episode, course, not physician, not M.D., don't prescribe
anything, professor profess things, translate scientific literature
point might useful avenues exploration, just
information purposes, definitely talk doctor anything
talking now episode, matter. look literature
menopause outside just standard estrogen therapy, interesting
compounds used supported quality peer-
reviewed studies, again, refer amazing website,
examine.com, can put essentially condition supplement,


will point human effect matrix, not animal studies, human studies
explored things. Now, huge variety won't go
them, pro-estrogenic compounds shown
powerful context menopause, well conditions estrogen
lower one like, include description literature, get
moment, something like black cohosh, think correct pronunciation,
literally word black C-O-H-O-S-H, interesting, 13
peer-reviewed studies reached prominence kind commercial

increases estrogen, seem real effect, significant
placebo effect, also significant placebo effect studies
well, interesting look studies many
carried period six-plus months, double-blind studies, et cetera,
almost lead modest increases estrogen modest decreases
menopause-related symptoms. Now, additional details studies,
generally carried women age 45 64, cases, look specifically
women clinically obese overweight, although not always, subject size
pools pretty big, know, anywhere 50 87, decent size, 132
subjects, et cetera, look like quality studies, basically point
fact black cohosh can modest effect improving menopause symptoms.
one Panax ginseng, P-N-A-A-X ginseng, shown decrease
symptoms associated menopause, mostly related libido, although
effects unreliable. things, like maca, known increase dopamine
actually, minor effects, things like, names little hard pronounce,
forgive me, things like Valeriana officinalis shown can
improvement hot flash symptoms insomnia associated that,
might worth exploring, again, discuss doctor,
100-subject plus, age 45 64 individuals, double-blind placebo-controlled studies
showed significant modest effects. one substance gallery
compounds looked turns particularly interesting, one
also particularly difficult pronounce, Pueraria mirifica, going spell

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper
ratios, things call sort usual suspects, vitamin D,
important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want
understand exactly negative effects not sufficient zinc
magnesium, levels might actually be, paper available,
can go PubMed, can't pronounce last name, sorry, looks like
Wrzosek, W-R-Z-O-S-E-K, hope didn't butcher badly, Wrzosek et al.
2020 "Endocrinology Metabolism Review," recent paper good,
peer-reviewed journal talks mainly hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal


axis sex steroid hormones negatively impacted deficiencies
magnesium, deficiencies vitamin D, deficiencies zinc, however, doesn't
point levels one take order optimize, doesn't say take X
amount zinc X amount magnesium X amount vitamin D, information,
context-dependent individual-dependent, highly recommend go
examine.com, can put zinc magnesium vitamin D, will give
ranges dosages supported specific studies, again, information
completely free you, useful figuring out. personally
supplemented zinc, magnesium, vitamin D years, many people
well, question always, much? proponent
getting blood work done know whether not androgen

takeaway studies looking deficiencies cause terms deficits
testosterone estrogen really point direction of, make sure getting
adequate zinc, magnesium, D3 unless want steroid hormone levels
reduced whatever reason.

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing
hormone neurons, neurons within hypothalamus communicate
pituitary, fact, people take large amounts opioids, even take low levels
opioids long periods time, will develop sorts endocrine syndromes,
shown again, gynecomastia, male breast development males,
disruptions ovary females, really quite terrible situation, excessive
opioids problematic sex steroid hormones, don't think anyone will
trouble finding literature that, can just go PubMed, can put opioids,

testosterone estrogen release.

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual
consumption bull testes, can go Amazon right now, certainly don't suggest
this, can actually buy ground testes cows, can
consume those, now, lot going broken gut, certainly not
suggesting that, just point huge vast literature,
actually dates back hundreds years even though testosterone wasn't discovered
long ago specific hormone molecule characterized resynthesized,
huge industry powerful effects has, likewise estrogen,

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,

range, testosterone isn't just roaming around free blood, least
isn't, bound either sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG, albumin,
needed transporters get testosterone cells testosterone can

endurance exercise extends beyond 75 minutes going start lead
reductions testosterone, presumably increases cortisol, course,
intensity exercise going important too, know, don't think anyone
really believes hiking three hours going reduce testosterone, whereas
think one go run hard three hours can imagine there'd
reductions testosterone way increases cortisol, area certainly
needs research, pretty clear limiting endurance exercise 75 minutes
less, not making intense, one way keep cortisol going roof,
talked previous episodes, lot others talked
clamp cortisol, keep cortisol reduced, also one
reasons why, can imagine, various individuals, either competition just
purposes, rely testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just
weight training, endurance exercise, one reasons every
while, professional cyclists will get popped performance-enhancing drugs,
meaning get caught, not just increasing red blood cells
EPO things sort, oftentimes also taking testosterone not
want large massively hypertrophied muscles, injecting

01:24:41 Estrogen & Menopause: Compounds May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms

just justifying rationale endurance athlete want
all. now switch talking estrogen, many people
trying optimize estrogen levels, one places shows lot
get lot questions menopause, menopause, mentioned earlier,
fairly massive reduction amount estrogen circulating one's blood
mainly ovary now depleted estrogen production own,
eggs not produced, depleted, et cetera. menopause
characterized variety symptoms, multifaceted, probably deserves
entire episode own, things like hot flashes, things like mood swings, things like
headaches, particular migraine headaches, can lot brain fog, can
very, disruptive people. Now, sometimes hear andropause,


thought kind analog menopause, menopause certain
characteristics make robust phenomenon women, whereas
men, andropause going sometimes happen, sometimes won't, fact, without going
details graphs data, clear, mentioned earlier,
men maintain levels circulating androgens quite high, even similar
puberty teen years 20s, well 60s, 70s, 80s
optimizing lot things, probably genetics plays role well,
whereas males won't, within female population, population individuals
ovaries, stereotyped characteristic reduction estrogen
levels number eggs becomes depleted, think
menopause. various things one can menopause? Well, one
common ones physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen,
hormone therapy somebody takes either oral estrogen use
patch pellet, way secrete estradiol system, varying
success depending individual, people respond well it, people
really challenges it, lot side effects associated
people, not others, addition, concern always supplementing
estrogen breast cancer background family concern
breast cancer reason lot cancers estrogen-dependent,
drugs like tamoxifen anastrozole drugs block either
aromatase block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly initially developed,
see lot internet, again, sports folks trying increase
testosterone, reduce estrogen, remember, drugs initially developed
ways prevent estrogen binding estrogen receptor cancer treatments,
want clear said many times, always put caption
episode, course, not physician, not M.D., don't prescribe
anything, professor profess things, translate scientific literature
point might useful avenues exploration, just
information purposes, definitely talk doctor anything
talking now episode, matter. look literature
menopause outside just standard estrogen therapy, interesting
compounds used supported quality peer-

examine.com, can put essentially condition supplement,


will point human effect matrix, not animal studies, human studies
explored things. Now, huge variety won't go
them, pro-estrogenic compounds shown
powerful context menopause, well conditions estrogen
lower one like, include description literature, get
moment, something like black cohosh, think correct pronunciation,
literally word black C-O-H-O-S-H, interesting, 13
peer-reviewed studies reached prominence kind commercial
landscape substance, black cohosh, promoted way increase
estrogen, turns effects consistent fairly minor, fairly minor
increases estrogen, seem real effect, significant
placebo effect, also significant placebo effect studies
well, interesting look studies many
carried period six-plus months, double-blind studies, et cetera,
almost lead modest increases estrogen modest decreases
menopause-related symptoms. Now, additional details studies,
generally carried women age 45 64, cases, look specifically
women clinically obese overweight, although not always, subject size
pools pretty big, know, anywhere 50 87, decent size, 132
subjects, et cetera, look like quality studies, basically point
fact black cohosh can modest effect improving menopause symptoms.
one Panax ginseng, P-N-A-A-X ginseng, shown decrease
symptoms associated menopause, mostly related libido, although
effects unreliable. things, like maca, known increase dopamine
actually, minor effects, things like, names little hard pronounce,
forgive me, things like Valeriana officinalis shown can
improvement hot flash symptoms insomnia associated that,
might worth exploring, again, discuss doctor,
100-subject plus, age 45 64 individuals, double-blind placebo-controlled studies
showed significant modest effects. one substance gallery

01:33:18 Nutrients Optimize Foundation Hormones

role specific compounds, which, many can taken
supplementation form extracted diet nutrition order optimize sex steroid
hormones, again, just want emphasize not suggesting anyone take
anything stop taking anything, purely informational purposes,
data quite striking impressive. clear certain collections
nutrients useful promoting testosterone estrogen production proper
ratios, things call sort usual suspects, vitamin D,
important many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, want look deeply want
understand exactly negative effects not sufficient zinc
magnesium, levels might actually be, paper available,
can go PubMed, can't pronounce last name, sorry, looks like
Wrzosek, W-R-Z-O-S-E-K, hope didn't butcher badly, Wrzosek et al.
2020 "Endocrinology Metabolism Review," recent paper good,
peer-reviewed journal talks mainly hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal


axis sex steroid hormones negatively impacted deficiencies
magnesium, deficiencies vitamin D, deficiencies zinc, however, doesn't
point levels one take order optimize, doesn't say take X
amount zinc X amount magnesium X amount vitamin D, information,
context-dependent individual-dependent, highly recommend go
examine.com, can put zinc magnesium vitamin D, will give
ranges dosages supported specific studies, again, information
completely free you, useful figuring out. personally
supplemented zinc, magnesium, vitamin D years, many people
well, question always, much? proponent
getting blood work done know whether not androgen
levels, well things like vitamin D levels, et cetera, sufficiently high,
takeaway studies looking deficiencies cause terms deficits
testosterone estrogen really point direction of, make sure getting
adequate zinc, magnesium, D3 unless want steroid hormone levels
reduced whatever reason.

01:36:00 Opioids Severe Hormone Disruptors

One things shown time time negative effects
sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly women,
opioids. whole issue, course, opioid epidemic, deserving
entire episode, going talk experts addiction people
treat pain forth, opioids dramatically reduce levels testosterone
estrogen, mainly disrupting receptors gonadotropin-releasing
hormone neurons, neurons within hypothalamus communicate
pituitary, fact, people take large amounts opioids, even take low levels
opioids long periods time, will develop sorts endocrine syndromes,
shown again, gynecomastia, male breast development males,
disruptions ovary females, really quite terrible situation, excessive
opioids problematic sex steroid hormones, don't think anyone will
trouble finding literature that, can just go PubMed, can put opioids,
testosterone, opioids, estrogen, major effect actually way
hypothalamus shut production GnRH, hormone stimulates


testosterone estrogen release.

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual
consumption bull testes, can go Amazon right now, certainly don't suggest
this, can actually buy ground testes cows, can
consume those, now, lot going broken gut, certainly not
suggesting that, just point huge vast literature,
actually dates back hundreds years even though testosterone wasn't discovered
long ago specific hormone molecule characterized resynthesized,
huge industry powerful effects has, likewise estrogen,
development birth control pill made possible understanding
structure estrogen estradiol, going talk birth control
works influence various pathways future episode,
supplement compounds supported scientific literature terms
ability adjust androgens,

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,
dramatic role creating kind masculinization brain prenatally, also
defines primary sex characteristic growth penis, et cetera, beyond
infancy early childhood later life, powerful effects creating balding,
beard growth, et cetera, much higher affinity androgen receptor
testosterone, creatine can increase DHT, means take creatine


DHT-susceptible, might experience hair loss,
heavily debated, creatine cause baldness? going depend, going
depend much 5-alpha reductase prone hair loss are,
people can take creatine without problem terms hair loss, people
cannot, start losing hair levels that, least them, aren't comfortable.
things can increase testosterone

01:40:14 Free Bound Testosterone: SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin), Tongat
Ali

way testosterone exists free bound form,
testosterone, molecule kind total testosterone, usually measured,
kind levels typically thrown around anywhere 300 900
kind natural range, supraphysiological, getting 1,200, 1,600
range, testosterone isn't just roaming around free blood, least
isn't, bound either sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG, albumin,
needed transporters get testosterone cells testosterone can
effects gene expression well pathways within cells, people
talk level free testosterone really important want
optimize free testosterone, little bit tricky statement, kind like,
true, yet, not really reflective thorough understanding binding
globulins work, remember, binding globulins aren't soak
testosterone just make hard free testosterone know, make
gains gym whatever is, increases libido, actually
transport testosterone specific tissues, shuttle specific tissues set
rate bound unbound testosterone not unbound once,
know, always interesting look literature see everyone wants
free testosterone can work, sex hormone binding globulin can bind
much testosterone point negative effects libido
muscle growth fat loss things sort, true males females,
can exactly supposed do, shuttling testosterone
proper tissues organs effects, including brain.
supplements, particular, tongkat ali, is, name, something
called tongkat ali, sometimes called, forgive hard pronounce,


Eurycoma longifolia Jack, always seem names kind allude
androgenic features, like don't know why, longifolia Jack, don't know, think kind
obvious sounds sort androgenic. shown several studies,
can find examine.com, can go PubMed like, looked
these, seem pro-fertility, pro-free testosterone, subtle
aphrodisiac effects, also seem slight anti-estrogen, reports
are, people take anywhere 400 800 milligrams day, again, not
suggesting that, kind there, decent
scientific literature support fact liberates bound testosterone
allows free testosterone available, reported quote-unquote
side effects things like excessive alertness insomnia taken late
day forth,

01:43:23 Nettles, Prostate, Boron, & Blood Brain Barrier

encourage explore that's, increasing free testosterone
something interested doing. Examine.com includes lot things
can increase testosterone, one things purported free
testosterone blood things like nettles, stinging nettles, although point
literature points stinging nettle also fairly potent effects
prostate liver, might tricky molecule maybe not
attractive one people take. talked creatine, talked tongkat
ali, clear boron, really interesting, believe not, think boron comes
from, think like, meteors landed Earth now extract boron,
one crazy stories that, look it, go like, "How
possibly be?" actually, works, boron, scientific
support freeing testosterone, again, freeing testosterone may
exactly want, just don't think demonize carrier proteins
like albumin SHBG, fact, albumin important testosterone able
make brain pro-androgenic effects cognitive effects
testosterone males females, testosterone can shift
behaviors, like mate-seeking, reductions anxiety, forth, talked
before, making brain, thing called blood-brain
barrier, fascinating deserving entire episode also, getting


molecules across blood-brain barrier, even sex steroid hormones,
lipophilic can pass cell membranes, requires carriers, carriers
often bound include albumin, not goal free
testosterone, getting free testosterone range works particular
goals needs attractive one, discussing particular
tools. amounts boron people take,

01:47:43 Ecdysteroids: Mimic Mammalian Hormones

looking kind people talking about, also
mean scientific literature, one things new me, anyway, probably
not new lot gym rats there, people spend lot time
YouTube videos talking androgens, these, forgive butchering name
again, ecdysteroids, ecdysteroids molecules come things like
spinach, believe not, lot similarity cholesterol molecule, one
discussed lot right now something called turkesterone, wish

anything turkeys? don't know called turkesterone, perhaps
someone will know. case, ecdysteroids similar enough cholesterol,
remember, cholesterol precursor testosterone, cortisol, estrogen,

cares? whole issue augmenting hormones sports interesting
issue, fact, just want little anecdote that, can't reveal names here,
course, learned recently surprising many athletes
pro sports taking testosterone, able legally not just
available prescription, allowed rules

always, always, always, except extreme cases, going far subtler, excuse me, far
subtle, use proper English, far subtle be, instance, just

honest upfront that. thus far terms talking optimizing hormones

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone
background menstrual cycle really going disrupt way things interact,
just exquisite feedback loop, not saying don't that,

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-
fertility, pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen depending background,
interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed
it, weird, case, human chorionic gonadotropin now available
prescription drug one things many people use increase
testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one
common ones, get deficiencies LH FSH, people will take
hCG stimulate gonads, variety reasons drugs
created, certain supplements, not many, apparently can increase
luteinizing hormone thereby can increase testosterone estrogen, one
well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone
background menstrual cycle really going disrupt way things interact,
just exquisite feedback loop, not saying don't that,
definitely want aware doing, blood draws one way

well-documented one Fadogia agrestis, F-A-D-O-G-I-A, separate word, A-
G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, least according literature able find, can
increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels testosterone levels
estrogen, again, individual take Fadogia agrestis,
probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone
chromosomal gonadal background, remember, ratio both, someone
low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject
negative feedback, talked previously previous episode,


testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start
throw off various hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, menstrual cycle
just absolutely exquisite balance feedback luteinizing hormone kept low
constant, least first 14 days cycle, mid cycle, peak,
typically ovulation occurs, pregnancy likely
middle 28-day cycle, FSH kind goes across first 14 days,
taking anything really modifying one's estrogens testosterone
background menstrual cycle really going disrupt way things interact,
just exquisite feedback loop, not saying don't that,
definitely want aware doing, blood draws one way

promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic

taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-

interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold

promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
testes promote testosterone sperm production, prescription version
increasing luteinizing hormone something called hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, synthesized now available prescription drug,
taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-

interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant

excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one

01:37:23 Testes, Antlers & Ovaries

Now, entire industry devoted supplements various things people
can take increase testosterone, scientific data support them,
not, anecdotal support
not. ranges broadly, mean, things like material off deer antlers,
high in, supposedly, IGF1, growth hormone pathway, way actual
consumption bull testes, can go Amazon right now, certainly don't suggest
this, can actually buy ground testes cows, can
consume those, now, lot going broken gut, certainly not
suggesting that, just point huge vast literature,
actually dates back hundreds years even though testosterone wasn't discovered
long ago specific hormone molecule characterized resynthesized,
huge industry powerful effects has, likewise estrogen,
development birth control pill made possible understanding
structure estrogen estradiol, going talk birth control
works influence various pathways future episode,
supplement compounds supported scientific literature terms
ability adjust androgens,

01:38:50 Creatine & Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)

things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone. One ones really good
evidence creatine, clear something creatine, although
mechanism isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase makes
testosterone molecule susceptible certain enzymatic reactions leads
increases DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, mentioned previous episode,
dramatic role creating kind masculinization brain prenatally, also
defines primary sex characteristic growth penis, et cetera, beyond
infancy early childhood later life, powerful effects creating balding,
beard growth, et cetera, much higher affinity androgen receptor
testosterone, creatine can increase DHT, means take creatine


DHT-susceptible, might experience hair loss,
heavily debated, creatine cause baldness? going depend, going
depend much 5-alpha reductase prone hair loss are,
people can take creatine without problem terms hair loss, people
cannot, start losing hair levels that, least them, aren't comfortable.

01:40:14 Free Bound Testosterone: SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin), Tongat
Ali

way testosterone exists free bound form,
testosterone, molecule kind total testosterone, usually measured,
kind levels typically thrown around anywhere 300 900
kind natural range, supraphysiological, getting 1,200, 1,600
range, testosterone isn't just roaming around free blood, least
isn't, bound either sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG, albumin,
needed transporters get testosterone cells testosterone can
effects gene expression well pathways within cells, people
talk level free testosterone really important want
optimize free testosterone, little bit tricky statement, kind like,
true, yet, not really reflective thorough understanding binding
globulins work, remember, binding globulins aren't soak
testosterone just make hard free testosterone know, make
gains gym whatever is, increases libido, actually
transport testosterone specific tissues, shuttle specific tissues set
rate bound unbound testosterone not unbound once,
know, always interesting look literature see everyone wants
free testosterone can work, sex hormone binding globulin can bind
much testosterone point negative effects libido
muscle growth fat loss things sort, true males females,
can exactly supposed do, shuttling testosterone
proper tissues organs effects, including brain.
supplements, particular, tongkat ali, is, name, something
called tongkat ali, sometimes called, forgive hard pronounce,


Eurycoma longifolia Jack, always seem names kind allude
androgenic features, like don't know why, longifolia Jack, don't know, think kind
obvious sounds sort androgenic. shown several studies,
can find examine.com, can go PubMed like, looked
these, seem pro-fertility, pro-free testosterone, subtle
aphrodisiac effects, also seem slight anti-estrogen, reports
are, people take anywhere 400 800 milligrams day, again, not

scientific literature support fact liberates bound testosterone
allows free testosterone available, reported quote-unquote
side effects things like excessive alertness insomnia taken late
day forth,

from, think like, meteors landed Earth now extract boron,
one crazy stories that, look it, go like, "How

support freeing testosterone, again, freeing testosterone may
exactly want, just don't think demonize carrier proteins
like albumin SHBG, fact, albumin important testosterone able
make brain pro-androgenic effects cognitive effects

taken various contexts increasing fertility males females, can


increase, reasons now make sense, can increase sperm production,
can produce ovulation frequency, can produce number eggs, even,
deployed given ovulation, although not always good thing, basically pro-

interesting hCG initially synthesized, collected synthesized pregnant
women's urine, believe not, synthetically made sold
prescription drug, actually black market pregnant women's urine
people buy urine, don't know, guessing probably just consumed

testosterone estrogen increasing fertility, cases think used increase
sports performance people shut gonads whatever reason
excessive hormone therapies sort of, sometimes
actually lesions pituitary, sometimes people tumor pituitary,
actually not common, among brain tumors neural tumors, one

probably find testosterone estrogen increase anyone

low estrogen high testosterone, say testes just way
example, expected increase, someone high
estrogen low testosterone, just say ovaries,
increase taking Fadogia agrestis. side effect profile Fadogia agrestis hasn't
really documented, little unclear, just want emphasize anytime
someone's going start taking supplements, modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done extremely important safety reasons, also just know
whether not things working, things subject

testosterone goes high, high, can feed back shut luteinizing hormone,
will shut testosterone production, likewise, estrogens
going high going high various phases cycle, can start

cares? whole issue augmenting hormones sports interesting
issue, fact, just want little anecdote that, can't reveal names here,
course, learned recently surprising many athletes
pro sports taking testosterone, able legally not just
available prescription, allowed rules
sport fine print no one, including me, ever seen,
injury, athletes injured, opens door certain forms
testosterone augmentation types augmentations not available
not injured, always makes wonder now see getting
injured whether not attempt get support
absolutely no question estrogens testosterones modulate gene expression,
modulate strength, modulate way brain works, modulates relationship
effort anxiety, et cetera, talking supplementation, effects
supplementation, say, individuals can quite dramatic,
always, always, always, except extreme cases, going far subtler, excuse me, far
subtle, use proper English, far subtle be, instance, just
injecting testosterone injecting estrogen, et cetera, think just
honest upfront that. thus far terms talking optimizing hormones

01:51:50 Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis

discussion supplementation, haven't really talked things
actually affect brain directly, increase pituitary output things sort,
mainly talking things free testosterone increase
estrogen level periphery, remember way back beginning
episode, hormones made different locations body
hormones promote release production hormones tissues
body, one main hormones luteinizing hormone, luteinizing
hormone, again, comes pituitary, circulates either goes ovary
promote various aspects egg maturation well production estrogen,
