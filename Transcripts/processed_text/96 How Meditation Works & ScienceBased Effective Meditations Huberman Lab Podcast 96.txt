going talk areas brain body active meditation
meditation can beneficial. will also talk
best meditate. Now, topic long interested in. first given book
meditation high school because, make long story short, bit
wild one early high school years, consequence program
in, somebody handed book meditation. book still available now.
book called "Wherever Go, Are" Jon Kabat-Zinn. one
first, not only, one first people really start popularizing meditation
mindfulness practices United States. late 1980s,
really recently studies meditation, although
really picked '90s. Now can find many, many thousands studies
meditation mechanistic basis, brain imaging studies, changes hormones
body. late 1980s early 1990s, functional imaging
brain, so-called MRI fMRI, really just starting emerge popular tool
laboratories hospitals, really wasn't much mechanistic understanding
meditation worked, but, course, deep understanding
cultures outside United States meditation extremely useful. just
mention, long talking history meditation, discussion
meditation going discussion states mind, discussion
states mind invokes word consciousness, kind dangerous topic get
format lot people talk consciousness, people use
consciousness, word, mean different things. doesn't one standard


operational definition scientists call it. However, discussions consciousness
often part parcel conversations things like psychedelics kind
alternative therapies. 1960s especially 1970s, meditation
psychedelics actually close cousins conversation consciousness
states mind. conversation started split two different divisions,
explain moment. gets little bit interesting academic sociology.
happened couple guys Harvard, including Timothy Leary
others, got really interested psychedelics, particular LSD, lysergic acid
diethylamide. time, part whole counterculture movement,
considered anti-establishment, really encouraging students
Harvard take LSD. also interested meditation. ended
happening essentially got kicked fired Harvard, book
refer show note captions interested learning
this. got kicked fired emphasis psychedelics. Now,
nowadays, lot interest psychedelics. episodes Dr. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins University running clinical trials psychedelics like
psilocybin LSD treatment depression PTSD. also Dr. Nolan
Williams podcast, colleague Stanford incredible studies
compounds well. nowadays, conversation psychedelics
coming back, somewhat divorced conversation meditation,
1960s 1970s, conversation psychedelics meditation sort
one same. changed late 1980s early 1990s people like
Jon Kabat-Zinn started writing books purely meditation suggesting
people explore meditative practices utility bring calmness, adjust stress,
improve sleep, et cetera, divorced conversation psychedelics. Now,
not say scientific community immediately embraced conversation
meditation. fact, took quite long schools like Harvard Stanford
universities around world start embracing funding studies meditation,
asking sorts brain areas involved, changes body, and, perhaps
importantly, meditation practice can shift brain body
somebody finished meditating off life everyday things.
late 1980s especially within 1990s, advent brain imaging technology like
magnetic residence imaging, MRI, functional magnetic residence imaging way
look brain active, not just get image structure, also


functioning areas so-called light up. technology
became accessible popular, well, allowed large number laboratories start
asking specific patterns thinking breathing, maybe people sitting lotus
position, often that, people inside MRI magnet
magnet, sort put little tube push tube, not
will course, put people tube, meditate, look
brain changed time. studies done,
discovered really quite miraculous, really. now don't think
surprising, discovered huge laundry list brain changes.
people evaluated outside life, fill reports
subjective feelings happiness report sleep, even objective
measures taken like changes hormones markers inflammation, et cetera,
large list information fell revealed indeed many,
dozen clear benefits regular meditation practice,
meditation practices quite short. nowadays, think meditation pretty
commonly accepted, fact, lot fact many major
tech companies Bay Area 2000s Google Apple
number different social media companies companies business
ventures, et cetera, investment firms world started hiring people train
meditation online courses meditation. nowadays, think meditation
thing almost everybody understands can benefit us, now sit
interesting frontier people think meditation one thing, sort like
word exercise, which, course, mean weight training, mean running,
mean high-intensity interval training, which, know, will get
different results depending do, often it, specifics
actually do. So, too, meditation can give specific results. can give
focus, can give better sleep, can give combination results just
like exercise can depending exercise. going talk next
specific changes happen brain specific aspects meditation. is,
happens close eyes, happens focus attention
inward versus focusing attention outward because, mentioned before,
third eye meditation close eyes focus spot just behind
forehead focus breathing. also meditation practices
focusing eating lot so-called mindfulness,


present whatever's happening, not letting mind wander think yesterday
tomorrow happening next, really focusing present. also
meditation practices, course, format interpersonal
communication really listening intensely. That, too, form
mindfulness. going parse things, going ask
happening brain body meditation practices
can develop specific meditation practices can invoke real life

even week even month will still clearly benefit
specific ways. like spend next 10 minutes talking
neuroscience meditation, promise not going just list off bunch
different brain areas active meditation. wouldn't useful you.
fact, don't believe throwing lot nomenclature without also giving
mechanistic explanation different brain areas do. say, "Well,
good knowing different brain areas names can't actually
manipulate brain areas?" good news actually can manipulate
brain areas. tell today, can turn activity certain brain areas
turn activity specific brain areas specific elements meditation
practice, quite exciting quite different really aspects
neuroscience might discuss podcast. different brain
areas whose names like arm with. again, names aren't
essential, can grasp even top contour say,
much better position parse use information follows. area
brain sits right behind forehead called prefrontal cortex.
Basically, front bumper head just behind bone, okay? area just
behind forehead call prefrontal cortex actually encompasses lot
different things. actually, two them. one right side
brain one left side brain, connected one
another actually different things. area like focus today
bit so-called left prefrontal cortex, going get really specific,
say left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Dorsal means up, lateral means side,


want touch left side head move hand just toward
midline, toward sort top head little bit, dorsal, lateral,
long hand still side head, left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, okay? got hand probably right left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. area brain, know lesion studies
damaged animals humans know stimulation studies
selectively stimulated animals, yes, indeed, also done humans,
incredible ability control bodily senses make sense, is,
interpret going terms emotions bodily sensations.
now on, unless say otherwise, say prefrontal cortex, specifically referring
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, going shorten just sake
simplicity ease communication. going talk another area prefrontal
cortex, talk another area, say prefrontal cortex today, mean left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Stimulation left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or,
say appropriately, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex active,
great position interpret going emotionally, interpret bodily
signals comfort discomfort, make really good decisions basis
interpretation. left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex direct
communication directly connected another brain area called anterior
cingulate cortex, ACC. Now, just going refer ACC, okay? ACC
area brain interpreting lot different things bodily signals,
instance, fast breathing, whether not heart beating quickly
slowly, and, importantly, whether not heart beating quickly slowly
circumstance in. instance, running hill
even great shape heart beating fast, unlikely going
concerned heart beating fast appropriate
circumstance. However, just walking along sudden, heart starts
beating quickly no apparent reason, well, going interpret
either pathologic uncomfortable, inappropriate context happen
in. left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex area brain actually
control especially can interpret going ACC region. Now,
probably haven't heard ACC. probably heard brain
area called amygdala. almond-shaped structure two sides brain,
people talk fear center, et cetera. ACC, anterior cingulate


cortex, gets input areas like amygdala, threat detection centers, also
gets input enormous number areas brain body, including
heart, gut, gets information full, is, distended,
empty gut is. gets information quickly breathing input
lungs related structures. absolutely critical station making sense
going body, works closely along one structure.
promise going third structure triad, stop listing
off names. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Think sort
interpreter going inside you. ACC, anterior cingulate

going inside body even surface body. know,
pain itch mosquito bite surface body, ACC
definitely register that. absolutely incredible brain structure
called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A, insula, insula bunch different
parts it. insula another area interpreting signals going
brain body, ACC insula working together try figure
out, know, going inside me? addition that, insula
interpreting information going outside you. insula saying,
instance, hey, steep hill running up, consequence, whatever
heart rate increase experiencing heavy breathing burning lungs,
makes sense. don't worried, don't scared. might want
slow down, makes sense. Whereas, instance, example previously
gave, sitting room everything pretty calm, sudden,
start feeling really uncomfortable, like stomach doesn't feel right start
breathing quickly start so-called anxiety panic attack, large part,
shift bodily sensations doesn't match doesn't correspond
something outside world. incredible triad includes left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate anterior cingulate cortex, insula,
three working together kind conversation, neural conversation,
conversation nonetheless, trying figure out, okay, going inside me?
feel? thinking about? thoughts past
future present. also conversation whether not
sensations experiencing, meaning quick breathing slow
breathing is, heart feels, skin feels, sensations pain,


pleasure matter, whether not makes sense situation
trying determine whether not right things consequence
sensations. Okay, again, can't remember names different
neural structures brain, don't worry it. really not critical.
critical understand conversation constantly occurring
long awake trying figure going inside whether
not makes sense relative going outside around you. Now, humans
smart. is, are, extent, conscious fact memories
past, awareness present, anticipation future. realize,
instance, can seated dinner table, excuse me, thought
something tomorrow, maybe exam stressing us something like
that, will change bodily state way not optimal
moment can still make sense us exam important,
maybe feeling pressure hard conversation have,
maybe excited next day can't eat
excited, can make perfect sense us access
knowledge self can think past, present, future.
makes conversation three structures even interesting dynamic
means can something, eating, talking, running,
number different activities, bodily state may may not match
way adaptive that, yet can completely okay least
understandable us. Now, major emphasis meditation practice make us so-
called mindful. mindfulness? Well, again, isn't one perfect universally
accepted operational definition mindfulness. basically nerd speak saying
people can't agree exactly mindfulness be, is, means everyone.
people assume, think agree, mindfulness includes something
present. say present, doesn't necessarily mean present one's
surroundings course lot meditation practices designed make
us mindful present designed make us mindful present
happening internally ignoring everything happening externally,
designed make us present

00:26:07 Neuroscience Meditation; Perceptual Spotlights



bodily sensations and, particular, breathing thoughts
moment. now explore generic meditation practice looks like,
evaluate tends change activity neural circuits brain
body. there, can split conversation couple different bins,
is, meditation practices ideal enhancing focus, meditation practices
ideal improving mood, meditation practices ideal improving sleep,
meditation practices that, believe not, benefit things one fell swoop.
Okay, happens meditation practice neural level? order
answer question, going scientists. means going
scientists now. going break practice different component
parts address know sure brain activation states occur
different component parts. order that, use somewhat generic
form meditation, generic pretty far-reaching say
people, 75%, say, meditation practice going involve stopping,
meaning getting motion, sitting lying down, and, cases, closing one's
eyes, although absolutely not required close one's eyes meditation.
many forms meditation done eyes open. people, going
involve stopping movement, is, not ambulating, not walking running,
seated lying eyes closed. that, meaning sit lie
close eyes, trivial shift might sound you, actually
profound shift way brain neural circuits body function
following reason. close eyes, shut major avenue
called exteroception. mean exteroception? Well, briefly,
sensing things body body time. also sensing things
outside us time, sights sounds, touch body,
sensations withinside body, et cetera. Now, sensation distinct call
perception. Perception is, put simply, sensations happen paying
attention to. given moment, sensing many, many things.
sound waves hitting ears, pressure receptors bottoms feet
sensing shoes sandals floor, et cetera, not perceiving
place attention them. Now, way perception works
so-called spotlights attention. can't perceive everything once, every sound,
every sight, every touch. overwhelming. fact, terrible.
Rather spotlights perception can either narrow, instance,


focus perception right now big toe right foot
really pour awareness, attention perceiving there,
feels like, tingling pressure, heat cold, et cetera, can broaden
spotlight include feet toes feet legs
whole body entire room. Perception like spotlight, mention
good data can split attention two probably not
two spotlights, can make spotlights perception either broad
diffuse narrow. can practice now like. can pick spot
wall away anywhere, driving, can look location,
can focus intensely one small location, instance, tree horizon
person street number different things outside you, can broaden
spotlight include entire scene once. can also focus spotlight
perception body, say left upper portion chest. course
can focus left upper portion chest something outside you, can
split attention two perceptual spotlights. hard, although not
impossible, three perceptual spotlights, people can split two points
attention perception pretty easily. thing people can pretty
easily merge two spotlights or, rather, just one spotlight attention.
don't always two spotlights attention on, here, using
word attention perception interchangeably. could, instance, two
points attention, talking somebody paying attention whether
not somebody's walking door not, two, completely
focused person talking to, completely focused
stomach ache great sensation hunger belly talking
somebody, fact, not even listening saying all. Okay?
two spotlights perception. can split merge one. And,
important, spotlights perception can intensify dim, there,
using analogy. mean perception happening within
spotlights can very, high acuity. is, can register fine changes
detail like tingling one side big toe right foot versus other, can
somewhat diffuse. just thinking whole toe, which,
case, seems like small area, point can consciously adjust acuity,
is, fineness perception. power
incredible ability brain structure whose name now understand know,


left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, although areas brain
involved well. ability direct attention specific things

happens level surface skin inside bodies. informs
us something important, actually two axes two ends
continuum perception. now, talking perception

conversation, within word perception within word attention,
continuum, continuum one end something called interoception.
Interoception, spelled I, everything sense level skin
inward, sensation inside stomach, sensation heart beating.
people can sense heart beating pretty easily. people challenge
that. feeling surface skin, hot cold feel,
interoception. contrast, end continuum so-called exteroception,
spelled E. Exteroception perception everything outside beyond
confines skin. shutting eyes, particular, meditative practice
direct attention toward so-called third eye center, area right behind
forehead, which, not incidentally, prefrontal cortex, cases
people will focus breathing, movement stomach movement
diaphragm lifting chest extension belly
breathe. that, taking ordinarily perceptual state split
outside world, exteroception, usually also toward inner state.
know, people generally touch feeling skin inward
also paying attention outside them. can think
somebody, instance, restaurant sandwich shop order sandwich
reading menu, exteroception, right? menu outside
confines skin. little ideas maybe big ideas come mind
roast beef sandwich vegetarian sandwich will taste like, will you,
it, like, don't like, et cetera. splitting interoception
exteroception. close eyes, stop, slow down, focus
breathing third eye center, majority perception shifts
interoception. shift end continuum interoception,
something important happens. happens two regions, ACC,
anterior cingulate cortex, insula, really ramp levels neural activity,


make perfect sense areas brain
registering paying attention various sensations full empty
stomach feels, whether not surface skin feels hot cold, on.
just sitting lying closing eyes, brain undergoes
massive shift exteroception interoception. Now, not say can't
distracted external events, and, fact, many people are, early stages
transitioning meditative state involve shift continuum, or,
say, one end continuum no down-up, just
continuum, shift along continuum heightened levels interoception. Now,
mentioned briefly before, many people interoceptively aware just
naturally, even don't meditation practice. people not.
pretty good measure whether not high levels interoceptive awareness
capability, ability count heartbeats without placing fingers
anywhere pressure take pulse. can like, can
actually try estimate number heartbeats simply trying feel heart

people not. seem ability can trained quite bit, and,
fact, meditative practices will improve interoceptive awareness, but,
important point, heightened levels interoceptive awareness, might
sound attractive, oh, really touch body, not always beneficial,
why? many people who, instance, excessive levels anxiety
excessive levels anxiety keenly aware subtle shift

examples people meditated quite lot develop heightened

actually intrusive daily activities. will ask ask question
now. somebody tends touch bodily sensations, so,
instance, skin inwards? somebody tends less touch

every one us answer, think people will answer depends.
depends whether not social setting whether not alone.

just fact. Now, actually studies meditation practice can

function not just meditation times. order illustrate this,
want start description now classic study. cool study,
cool name. talks something important will come
today's conversation, something called default mode network.
default mode network collection different brain areas essentially
active not much anything certainly active not
focused one particular task conversation activity. default mode network can
thought less network generates mind wandering
thoughts drifting past present future. Remember, earlier, talked
perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,
present, future two three things, okay? Just like
attentional spotlighting, can place mind, thinking, memory,
cognition onto one things very, present past present
forth. default mode network, involves lot different brain
areas, can thought simply network brain areas active
mind wandering different time domains. paper like share
you, mentioned before, now classic paper, wonderful title,
Wandering Mind Unhappy Mind. Now, sounds almost like news article

Killingsworth Dan Gilbert. published 2010, still considered classic.
paper, Wandering Mind Unhappy Mind, number important
points. going paraphrase certain elements say
essentially like know far better say. first all,
started statement, confess disagree with, is, "Unlike
animals, human beings spend lot time thinking not going around
them: contemplating events happened past, might happen future, will
never happen all." agree assertion human beings that.
certainly experience, although must say, don't think evidence
whatsoever animals don't also. apologies, Killingsworth
Gilbert, happy go toe-to-toe that. not aware data
prove one way animals thinking. set aside


animals, focus human animal. Now, point still good one,
humans wandering mind call stimulus-
independent thought. is, nothing happening create thoughts
anything happening immediate environment. thoughts just happening
internally. default mode network. study important.
fact, landmark study right time smartphones

also can lead to, referred earlier, neuroplasticity, changes
brain circuits underlie default mode network lead called
trait changes. want clear not first make state versus

can't recommend book highly enough. book "Altered Traits: Science Reveals
Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body." book Daniel

Now, think people familiar interoceptive-biased meditation.
Again, setting timer. Maybe don't even set timer, just sit

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people

these, practices covered podcast
guests, instance, highlighted 13-minute meditation Dr. Wendy Suzuki
New York University's laboratory popularized, popularized
wonderful paper will provide link shows daily 13-minute
meditation, traditional third eye, interoceptively biased, focus
breathing, focus location directly behind one's forehead both,

weeks, greatly improved mood, improved ability sleep, improved cognitive ability


focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day
meditation. However, trying establish long meditate, ask
couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne

talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice

order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice

cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale

drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales

exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],

different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern

make interoceptively aware. think back earlier

instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits

improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD

basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative

focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially

indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling

talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,

continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going
around you, dropping side continuum dissociated
not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people
position action-oriented focused, et cetera, come
yoga nidra, certainly useful practice. form meditation, call
meditation-ish, yoga nidra NSDR not typically people think
talk meditation. course, episode meditation. reason
bring yoga nidra NSDR many people meditate enhance sleep
ability reduce total amount sleep need. appears meditation
probably not ideal comparison yoga nidra NSDR, meditation
excellent, not superb, adjusting default mode network toward happiness
mindful present

02:11:33 Choosing Meditative Practice; Hypnosis

placing oneself healthy model interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
covered lot information, like think given key
decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want
thing going allow feel rested tired going allow
adjust state mind not want whatever reason,
anxious exhausted, et cetera." people, say practice like


NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form
meditation. also want just remind everybody app guides meditation, also
information intention setting, Waking app Sam
Harris can immensely beneficial. certainly found beneficial. know millions
people well, encourage check out. talked
determining continuums interoception exteroception
order dictate particular type meditation practice given
moment, whether not focus vision inward eyes closed focus
vision attention outward key component, whether not
cyclic breathing, will allow focus off breathing somewhat
easier non-cyclic breathing, doubling inhales exhales,
whether not breathing going natural not. And, course, need
determine whether not meditation practice designed enhance level
focus relax you. say designed enhance level focus,
doesn't necessarily mean won't relaxing. slow cadence breathing
third eye meditation, relaxing, yet focus refocus
practice, whereas something like yoga nidra NSDR going along
lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing
sleep need. previous podcasts, talked hypnosis, particularly
episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get
hypnosis now, just understand hypnosis distinct breathwork, yoga
nidra, NSDR, meditation even though includes
components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual
attention outward inward go hypnosis, involves breathing
particular kind, involves specific imagery, et cetera. hypnosis distinct
hypnosis really designed fix address specific problem, whereas meditation,
NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically not. can help fix problems
anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, generally not directed toward particular
line thinking. can be, typically not. Whereas hypnosis almost
always, especially clinical context, not stage hypnosis, clinical context
lot research show can, instance, help quitting smoking,
literally quadrupling effectiveness smoking cessation something like
Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
reducing pain number things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis really


great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

livemomentous.com/huberman. talk meditation. mentioned earlier,
going talk areas brain body active meditation
meditation can beneficial. will also talk
best meditate. Now, topic long interested in. first given book
meditation high school because, make long story short, bit
wild one early high school years, consequence program
in, somebody handed book meditation. book still available now.
book called "Wherever Go, Are" Jon Kabat-Zinn. one
first, not only, one first people really start popularizing meditation
mindfulness practices United States. late 1980s,
really recently studies meditation, although
really picked '90s. Now can find many, many thousands studies
meditation mechanistic basis, brain imaging studies, changes hormones
body. late 1980s early 1990s, functional imaging
brain, so-called MRI fMRI, really just starting emerge popular tool
laboratories hospitals, really wasn't much mechanistic understanding
meditation worked, but, course, deep understanding
cultures outside United States meditation extremely useful. just
mention, long talking history meditation, discussion
meditation going discussion states mind, discussion
states mind invokes word consciousness, kind dangerous topic get
format lot people talk consciousness, people use
consciousness, word, mean different things. doesn't one standard


operational definition scientists call it. However, discussions consciousness
often part parcel conversations things like psychedelics kind
alternative therapies. 1960s especially 1970s, meditation
psychedelics actually close cousins conversation consciousness
states mind. conversation started split two different divisions,
explain moment. gets little bit interesting academic sociology.
happened couple guys Harvard, including Timothy Leary
others, got really interested psychedelics, particular LSD, lysergic acid
diethylamide. time, part whole counterculture movement,
considered anti-establishment, really encouraging students
Harvard take LSD. also interested meditation. ended
happening essentially got kicked fired Harvard, book
refer show note captions interested learning
this. got kicked fired emphasis psychedelics. Now,
nowadays, lot interest psychedelics. episodes Dr. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins University running clinical trials psychedelics like
psilocybin LSD treatment depression PTSD. also Dr. Nolan
Williams podcast, colleague Stanford incredible studies
compounds well. nowadays, conversation psychedelics
coming back, somewhat divorced conversation meditation,
1960s 1970s, conversation psychedelics meditation sort
one same. changed late 1980s early 1990s people like
Jon Kabat-Zinn started writing books purely meditation suggesting
people explore meditative practices utility bring calmness, adjust stress,
improve sleep, et cetera, divorced conversation psychedelics. Now,
not say scientific community immediately embraced conversation
meditation. fact, took quite long schools like Harvard Stanford
universities around world start embracing funding studies meditation,
asking sorts brain areas involved, changes body, and, perhaps
importantly, meditation practice can shift brain body
somebody finished meditating off life everyday things.
late 1980s especially within 1990s, advent brain imaging technology like
magnetic residence imaging, MRI, functional magnetic residence imaging way
look brain active, not just get image structure, also


functioning areas so-called light up. technology
became accessible popular, well, allowed large number laboratories start
asking specific patterns thinking breathing, maybe people sitting lotus
position, often that, people inside MRI magnet
magnet, sort put little tube push tube, not
will course, put people tube, meditate, look
brain changed time. studies done,
discovered really quite miraculous, really. now don't think
surprising, discovered huge laundry list brain changes.
people evaluated outside life, fill reports
subjective feelings happiness report sleep, even objective
measures taken like changes hormones markers inflammation, et cetera,
large list information fell revealed indeed many,
dozen clear benefits regular meditation practice,
meditation practices quite short. nowadays, think meditation pretty
commonly accepted, fact, lot fact many major
tech companies Bay Area 2000s Google Apple
number different social media companies companies business
ventures, et cetera, investment firms world started hiring people train
meditation online courses meditation. nowadays, think meditation
thing almost everybody understands can benefit us, now sit
interesting frontier people think meditation one thing, sort like
word exercise, which, course, mean weight training, mean running,
mean high-intensity interval training, which, know, will get
different results depending do, often it, specifics
actually do. So, too, meditation can give specific results. can give
focus, can give better sleep, can give combination results just
like exercise can depending exercise. going talk next
specific changes happen brain specific aspects meditation. is,
happens close eyes, happens focus attention
inward versus focusing attention outward because, mentioned before,
third eye meditation close eyes focus spot just behind
forehead focus breathing. also meditation practices
focusing eating lot so-called mindfulness,


present whatever's happening, not letting mind wander think yesterday
tomorrow happening next, really focusing present. also
meditation practices, course, format interpersonal
communication really listening intensely. That, too, form
mindfulness. going parse things, going ask
happening brain body meditation practices
can develop specific meditation practices can invoke real life
daily basis or, thankfully, say, pretty busy,

00:16:19 Brain Interprets Body & Surrounding Environment; Mindfulness

even week even month will still clearly benefit
specific ways. like spend next 10 minutes talking
neuroscience meditation, promise not going just list off bunch
different brain areas active meditation. wouldn't useful you.
fact, don't believe throwing lot nomenclature without also giving
mechanistic explanation different brain areas do. say, "Well,
good knowing different brain areas names can't actually
manipulate brain areas?" good news actually can manipulate
brain areas. tell today, can turn activity certain brain areas
turn activity specific brain areas specific elements meditation
practice, quite exciting quite different really aspects
neuroscience might discuss podcast. different brain
areas whose names like arm with. again, names aren't
essential, can grasp even top contour say,
much better position parse use information follows. area
brain sits right behind forehead called prefrontal cortex.
Basically, front bumper head just behind bone, okay? area just
behind forehead call prefrontal cortex actually encompasses lot
different things. actually, two them. one right side
brain one left side brain, connected one
another actually different things. area like focus today
bit so-called left prefrontal cortex, going get really specific,
say left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Dorsal means up, lateral means side,


want touch left side head move hand just toward
midline, toward sort top head little bit, dorsal, lateral,
long hand still side head, left dorsolateral

three working together kind conversation, neural conversation,
conversation nonetheless, trying figure out, okay, going inside me?

pleasure matter, whether not makes sense situation
trying determine whether not right things consequence

neural structures brain, don't worry it. really not critical.
critical understand conversation constantly occurring
long awake trying figure going inside whether

smart. is, are, extent, conscious fact memories

instance, can seated dinner table, excuse me, thought

that, will change bodily state way not optimal
moment can still make sense us exam important,
maybe feeling pressure hard conversation have,
maybe excited next day can't eat
excited, can make perfect sense us access
knowledge self can think past, present, future.
makes conversation three structures even interesting dynamic
means can something, eating, talking, running,
number different activities, bodily state may may not match
way adaptive that, yet can completely okay least
understandable us. Now, major emphasis meditation practice make us so-
called mindful. mindfulness? Well, again, isn't one perfect universally
accepted operational definition mindfulness. basically nerd speak saying
people can't agree exactly mindfulness be, is, means everyone.
people assume, think agree, mindfulness includes something
present. say present, doesn't necessarily mean present one's

Okay, happens meditation practice neural level? order

scientists now. going break practice different component
parts address know sure brain activation states occur
different component parts. order that, use somewhat generic
form meditation, generic pretty far-reaching say
people, 75%, say, meditation practice going involve stopping,
meaning getting motion, sitting lying down, and, cases, closing one's
eyes, although absolutely not required close one's eyes meditation.
many forms meditation done eyes open. people, going
involve stopping movement, is, not ambulating, not walking running,
seated lying eyes closed. that, meaning sit lie
close eyes, trivial shift might sound you, actually
profound shift way brain neural circuits body function
following reason. close eyes, shut major avenue
called exteroception. mean exteroception? Well, briefly,
sensing things body body time. also sensing things
outside us time, sights sounds, touch body,
sensations withinside body, et cetera. Now, sensation distinct call
perception. Perception is, put simply, sensations happen paying
attention to. given moment, sensing many, many things.
sound waves hitting ears, pressure receptors bottoms feet
sensing shoes sandals floor, et cetera, not perceiving
place attention them. Now, way perception works
so-called spotlights attention. can't perceive everything once, every sound,
every sight, every touch. overwhelming. fact, terrible.
Rather spotlights perception can either narrow, instance,


focus perception right now big toe right foot
really pour awareness, attention perceiving there,
feels like, tingling pressure, heat cold, et cetera, can broaden
spotlight include feet toes feet legs
whole body entire room. Perception like spotlight, mention
good data can split attention two probably not
two spotlights, can make spotlights perception either broad
diffuse narrow. can practice now like. can pick spot
wall away anywhere, driving, can look location,
can focus intensely one small location, instance, tree horizon
person street number different things outside you, can broaden
spotlight include entire scene once. can also focus spotlight
perception body, say left upper portion chest. course
can focus left upper portion chest something outside you, can
split attention two perceptual spotlights. hard, although not
impossible, three perceptual spotlights, people can split two points
attention perception pretty easily. thing people can pretty
easily merge two spotlights or, rather, just one spotlight attention.
don't always two spotlights attention on, here, using
word attention perception interchangeably. could, instance, two
points attention, talking somebody paying attention whether
not somebody's walking door not, two, completely
focused person talking to, completely focused
stomach ache great sensation hunger belly talking
somebody, fact, not even listening saying all. Okay?
two spotlights perception. can split merge one. And,
important, spotlights perception can intensify dim, there,
using analogy. mean perception happening within
spotlights can very, high acuity. is, can register fine changes
detail like tingling one side big toe right foot versus other, can
somewhat diffuse. just thinking whole toe, which,

Interoception, spelled I, everything sense level skin

know, people generally touch feeling skin inward
also paying attention outside them. can think
somebody, instance, restaurant sandwich shop order sandwich

just sitting lying closing eyes, brain undergoes

transitioning meditative state involve shift continuum, or,
say, one end continuum no down-up, just

today's conversation, something called default mode network.
default mode network collection different brain areas essentially
active not much anything certainly active not

thought less network generates mind wandering
thoughts drifting past present future. Remember, earlier, talked
perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,
present, future two three things, okay? Just like
attentional spotlighting, can place mind, thinking, memory,
cognition onto one things very, present past present

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate

different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic

hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release

research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered

breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught

sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is

gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible

dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading

process nervous system, meaning brain connections

conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum

thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount

actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature

people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people
position action-oriented focused, et cetera, come
yoga nidra, certainly useful practice. form meditation, call
meditation-ish, yoga nidra NSDR not typically people think
talk meditation. course, episode meditation. reason
bring yoga nidra NSDR many people meditate enhance sleep
ability reduce total amount sleep need. appears meditation
probably not ideal comparison yoga nidra NSDR, meditation
excellent, not superb, adjusting default mode network toward happiness
mindful present

02:11:33 Choosing Meditative Practice; Hypnosis

placing oneself healthy model interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
covered lot information, like think given key
decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want
thing going allow feel rested tired going allow
adjust state mind not want whatever reason,
anxious exhausted, et cetera." people, say practice like


NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form
meditation. also want just remind everybody app guides meditation, also
information intention setting, Waking app Sam
Harris can immensely beneficial. certainly found beneficial. know millions
people well, encourage check out. talked
determining continuums interoception exteroception
order dictate particular type meditation practice given
moment, whether not focus vision inward eyes closed focus
vision attention outward key component, whether not
cyclic breathing, will allow focus off breathing somewhat
easier non-cyclic breathing, doubling inhales exhales,
whether not breathing going natural not. And, course, need
determine whether not meditation practice designed enhance level
focus relax you. say designed enhance level focus,
doesn't necessarily mean won't relaxing. slow cadence breathing
third eye meditation, relaxing, yet focus refocus
practice, whereas something like yoga nidra NSDR going along
lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing
sleep need. previous podcasts, talked hypnosis, particularly
episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get
hypnosis now, just understand hypnosis distinct breathwork, yoga
nidra, NSDR, meditation even though includes
components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual
attention outward inward go hypnosis, involves breathing
particular kind, involves specific imagery, et cetera. hypnosis distinct
hypnosis really designed fix address specific problem, whereas meditation,
NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically not. can help fix problems
anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, generally not directed toward particular
line thinking. can be, typically not. Whereas hypnosis almost
always, especially clinical context, not stage hypnosis, clinical context
lot research show can, instance, help quitting smoking,
literally quadrupling effectiveness smoking cessation something like
Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
reducing pain number things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis really


great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

supplements constantly expanding. Again,
livemomentous.com/huberman. talk meditation. mentioned earlier,
going talk areas brain body active meditation
meditation can beneficial. will also talk
best meditate. Now, topic long interested in. first given book
meditation high school because, make long story short, bit
wild one early high school years, consequence program
in, somebody handed book meditation. book still available now.
book called "Wherever Go, Are" Jon Kabat-Zinn. one
first, not only, one first people really start popularizing meditation
mindfulness practices United States. late 1980s,
really recently studies meditation, although
really picked '90s. Now can find many, many thousands studies
meditation mechanistic basis, brain imaging studies, changes hormones
body. late 1980s early 1990s, functional imaging
brain, so-called MRI fMRI, really just starting emerge popular tool
laboratories hospitals, really wasn't much mechanistic understanding
meditation worked, but, course, deep understanding
cultures outside United States meditation extremely useful. just
mention, long talking history meditation, discussion
meditation going discussion states mind, discussion
states mind invokes word consciousness, kind dangerous topic get
format lot people talk consciousness, people use
consciousness, word, mean different things. doesn't one standard


operational definition scientists call it. However, discussions consciousness
often part parcel conversations things like psychedelics kind
alternative therapies. 1960s especially 1970s, meditation
psychedelics actually close cousins conversation consciousness
states mind. conversation started split two different divisions,
explain moment. gets little bit interesting academic sociology.
happened couple guys Harvard, including Timothy Leary
others, got really interested psychedelics, particular LSD, lysergic acid
diethylamide. time, part whole counterculture movement,
considered anti-establishment, really encouraging students
Harvard take LSD. also interested meditation. ended
happening essentially got kicked fired Harvard, book
refer show note captions interested learning
this. got kicked fired emphasis psychedelics. Now,
nowadays, lot interest psychedelics. episodes Dr. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins University running clinical trials psychedelics like
psilocybin LSD treatment depression PTSD. also Dr. Nolan
Williams podcast, colleague Stanford incredible studies
compounds well. nowadays, conversation psychedelics
coming back, somewhat divorced conversation meditation,
1960s 1970s, conversation psychedelics meditation sort
one same. changed late 1980s early 1990s people like
Jon Kabat-Zinn started writing books purely meditation suggesting
people explore meditative practices utility bring calmness, adjust stress,
improve sleep, et cetera, divorced conversation psychedelics. Now,
not say scientific community immediately embraced conversation
meditation. fact, took quite long schools like Harvard Stanford
universities around world start embracing funding studies meditation,
asking sorts brain areas involved, changes body, and, perhaps
importantly, meditation practice can shift brain body
somebody finished meditating off life everyday things.
late 1980s especially within 1990s, advent brain imaging technology like
magnetic residence imaging, MRI, functional magnetic residence imaging way
look brain active, not just get image structure, also


functioning areas so-called light up. technology
became accessible popular, well, allowed large number laboratories start
asking specific patterns thinking breathing, maybe people sitting lotus
position, often that, people inside MRI magnet
magnet, sort put little tube push tube, not
will course, put people tube, meditate, look
brain changed time. studies done,
discovered really quite miraculous, really. now don't think
surprising, discovered huge laundry list brain changes.
people evaluated outside life, fill reports
subjective feelings happiness report sleep, even objective
measures taken like changes hormones markers inflammation, et cetera,
large list information fell revealed indeed many,
dozen clear benefits regular meditation practice,
meditation practices quite short. nowadays, think meditation pretty
commonly accepted, fact, lot fact many major
tech companies Bay Area 2000s Google Apple
number different social media companies companies business
ventures, et cetera, investment firms world started hiring people train
meditation online courses meditation. nowadays, think meditation
thing almost everybody understands can benefit us, now sit
interesting frontier people think meditation one thing, sort like
word exercise, which, course, mean weight training, mean running,
mean high-intensity interval training, which, know, will get
different results depending do, often it, specifics
actually do. So, too, meditation can give specific results. can give
focus, can give better sleep, can give combination results just
like exercise can depending exercise. going talk next
specific changes happen brain specific aspects meditation. is,
happens close eyes, happens focus attention
inward versus focusing attention outward because, mentioned before,
third eye meditation close eyes focus spot just behind
forehead focus breathing. also meditation practices
focusing eating lot so-called mindfulness,


present whatever's happening, not letting mind wander think yesterday
tomorrow happening next, really focusing present. also
meditation practices, course, format interpersonal
communication really listening intensely. That, too, form
mindfulness. going parse things, going ask
happening brain body meditation practices
can develop specific meditation practices can invoke real life
daily basis or, thankfully, say, pretty busy,

00:16:19 Brain Interprets Body & Surrounding Environment; Mindfulness

even week even month will still clearly benefit
specific ways. like spend next 10 minutes talking
neuroscience meditation, promise not going just list off bunch
different brain areas active meditation. wouldn't useful you.
fact, don't believe throwing lot nomenclature without also giving
mechanistic explanation different brain areas do. say, "Well,
good knowing different brain areas names can't actually
manipulate brain areas?" good news actually can manipulate
brain areas. tell today, can turn activity certain brain areas
turn activity specific brain areas specific elements meditation
practice, quite exciting quite different really aspects
neuroscience might discuss podcast. different brain
areas whose names like arm with. again, names aren't
essential, can grasp even top contour say,
much better position parse use information follows. area
brain sits right behind forehead called prefrontal cortex.
Basically, front bumper head just behind bone, okay? area just
behind forehead call prefrontal cortex actually encompasses lot
different things. actually, two them. one right side
brain one left side brain, connected one
another actually different things. area like focus today
bit so-called left prefrontal cortex, going get really specific,
say left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Dorsal means up, lateral means side,


want touch left side head move hand just toward
midline, toward sort top head little bit, dorsal, lateral,
long hand still side head, left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, okay? got hand probably right left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. area brain, know lesion studies
damaged animals humans know stimulation studies
selectively stimulated animals, yes, indeed, also done humans,
incredible ability control bodily senses make sense, is,
interpret going terms emotions bodily sensations.
now on, unless say otherwise, say prefrontal cortex, specifically referring
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, going shorten just sake
simplicity ease communication. going talk another area prefrontal
cortex, talk another area, say prefrontal cortex today, mean left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Stimulation left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or,
say appropriately, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex active,
great position interpret going emotionally, interpret bodily
signals comfort discomfort, make really good decisions basis
interpretation. left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex direct
communication directly connected another brain area called anterior
cingulate cortex, ACC. Now, just going refer ACC, okay? ACC
area brain interpreting lot different things bodily signals,
instance, fast breathing, whether not heart beating quickly
slowly, and, importantly, whether not heart beating quickly slowly
circumstance in. instance, running hill
even great shape heart beating fast, unlikely going
concerned heart beating fast appropriate
circumstance. However, just walking along sudden, heart starts
beating quickly no apparent reason, well, going interpret
either pathologic uncomfortable, inappropriate context happen
in. left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex area brain actually
control especially can interpret going ACC region. Now,
probably haven't heard ACC. probably heard brain
area called amygdala. almond-shaped structure two sides brain,
people talk fear center, et cetera. ACC, anterior cingulate


cortex, gets input areas like amygdala, threat detection centers, also
gets input enormous number areas brain body, including
heart, gut, gets information full, is, distended,
empty gut is. gets information quickly breathing input
lungs related structures. absolutely critical station making sense
going body, works closely along one structure.
promise going third structure triad, stop listing
off names. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Think sort
interpreter going inside you. ACC, anterior cingulate
cortex, area brain bringing information
going inside body even surface body. know,
pain itch mosquito bite surface body, ACC
definitely register that. absolutely incredible brain structure
called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A, insula, insula bunch different
parts it. insula another area interpreting signals going
brain body, ACC insula working together try figure
out, know, going inside me? addition that, insula
interpreting information going outside you. insula saying,
instance, hey, steep hill running up, consequence, whatever
heart rate increase experiencing heavy breathing burning lungs,
makes sense. don't worried, don't scared. might want
slow down, makes sense. Whereas, instance, example previously
gave, sitting room everything pretty calm, sudden,
start feeling really uncomfortable, like stomach doesn't feel right start
breathing quickly start so-called anxiety panic attack, large part,
shift bodily sensations doesn't match doesn't correspond
something outside world. incredible triad includes left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate anterior cingulate cortex, insula,
three working together kind conversation, neural conversation,
conversation nonetheless, trying figure out, okay, going inside me?
feel? thinking about? thoughts past
future present. also conversation whether not
sensations experiencing, meaning quick breathing slow
breathing is, heart feels, skin feels, sensations pain,


pleasure matter, whether not makes sense situation
trying determine whether not right things consequence
sensations. Okay, again, can't remember names different
neural structures brain, don't worry it. really not critical.
critical understand conversation constantly occurring
long awake trying figure going inside whether
not makes sense relative going outside around you. Now, humans
smart. is, are, extent, conscious fact memories
past, awareness present, anticipation future. realize,
instance, can seated dinner table, excuse me, thought
something tomorrow, maybe exam stressing us something like
that, will change bodily state way not optimal
moment can still make sense us exam important,
maybe feeling pressure hard conversation have,
maybe excited next day can't eat
excited, can make perfect sense us access
knowledge self can think past, present, future.
makes conversation three structures even interesting dynamic
means can something, eating, talking, running,
number different activities, bodily state may may not match
way adaptive that, yet can completely okay least
understandable us. Now, major emphasis meditation practice make us so-
called mindful. mindfulness? Well, again, isn't one perfect universally
accepted operational definition mindfulness. basically nerd speak saying
people can't agree exactly mindfulness be, is, means everyone.
people assume, think agree, mindfulness includes something
present. say present, doesn't necessarily mean present one's
surroundings course lot meditation practices designed make
us mindful present designed make us mindful present
happening internally ignoring everything happening externally,
designed make us present

00:26:07 Neuroscience Meditation; Perceptual Spotlights



bodily sensations and, particular, breathing thoughts
moment. now explore generic meditation practice looks like,
evaluate tends change activity neural circuits brain
body. there, can split conversation couple different bins,
is, meditation practices ideal enhancing focus, meditation practices
ideal improving mood, meditation practices ideal improving sleep,
meditation practices that, believe not, benefit things one fell swoop.
Okay, happens meditation practice neural level? order
answer question, going scientists. means going
scientists now. going break practice different component
parts address know sure brain activation states occur
different component parts. order that, use somewhat generic
form meditation, generic pretty far-reaching say
people, 75%, say, meditation practice going involve stopping,
meaning getting motion, sitting lying down, and, cases, closing one's
eyes, although absolutely not required close one's eyes meditation.
many forms meditation done eyes open. people, going
involve stopping movement, is, not ambulating, not walking running,
seated lying eyes closed. that, meaning sit lie
close eyes, trivial shift might sound you, actually
profound shift way brain neural circuits body function
following reason. close eyes, shut major avenue
called exteroception. mean exteroception? Well, briefly,
sensing things body body time. also sensing things
outside us time, sights sounds, touch body,
sensations withinside body, et cetera. Now, sensation distinct call
perception. Perception is, put simply, sensations happen paying
attention to. given moment, sensing many, many things.
sound waves hitting ears, pressure receptors bottoms feet
sensing shoes sandals floor, et cetera, not perceiving
place attention them. Now, way perception works
so-called spotlights attention. can't perceive everything once, every sound,
every sight, every touch. overwhelming. fact, terrible.
Rather spotlights perception can either narrow, instance,


focus perception right now big toe right foot
really pour awareness, attention perceiving there,
feels like, tingling pressure, heat cold, et cetera, can broaden
spotlight include feet toes feet legs
whole body entire room. Perception like spotlight, mention
good data can split attention two probably not
two spotlights, can make spotlights perception either broad
diffuse narrow. can practice now like. can pick spot
wall away anywhere, driving, can look location,
can focus intensely one small location, instance, tree horizon
person street number different things outside you, can broaden
spotlight include entire scene once. can also focus spotlight
perception body, say left upper portion chest. course
can focus left upper portion chest something outside you, can
split attention two perceptual spotlights. hard, although not
impossible, three perceptual spotlights, people can split two points
attention perception pretty easily. thing people can pretty
easily merge two spotlights or, rather, just one spotlight attention.
don't always two spotlights attention on, here, using
word attention perception interchangeably. could, instance, two
points attention, talking somebody paying attention whether
not somebody's walking door not, two, completely
focused person talking to, completely focused
stomach ache great sensation hunger belly talking
somebody, fact, not even listening saying all. Okay?
two spotlights perception. can split merge one. And,
important, spotlights perception can intensify dim, there,
using analogy. mean perception happening within
spotlights can very, high acuity. is, can register fine changes
detail like tingling one side big toe right foot versus other, can
somewhat diffuse. just thinking whole toe, which,
case, seems like small area, point can consciously adjust acuity,
is, fineness perception. power
incredible ability brain structure whose name now understand know,


left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, although areas brain
involved well. ability direct attention specific things
environment within body split points attention merge dial
intensity closely paying attention every little shift ripple
change sensation kind dissociate, will, lack better word,
disengage perception, control ability

get five free travel packs year's supply vitamin D3+K2. Okay, now
look example happens sit lie close eyes
decide meditate, immediately realize tremendous shift
perceptual ability, why? spotlight attention, can oriented
toward, instance, hear room maybe feeling wind moving


trees environment happen in, close eyes, shut
one major avenues sensory input, vision. that,
tendency perceptual spotlights focused
happens level surface skin inside bodies. informs
us something important, actually two axes two ends
continuum perception. now, talking perception
intention kind thing, indeed are, least sake
conversation, within word perception within word attention,
continuum, continuum one end something called interoception.
Interoception, spelled I, everything sense level skin
inward, sensation inside stomach, sensation heart beating.
people can sense heart beating pretty easily. people challenge
that. feeling surface skin, hot cold feel,
interoception. contrast, end continuum so-called exteroception,
spelled E. Exteroception perception everything outside beyond
confines skin. shutting eyes, particular, meditative practice
direct attention toward so-called third eye center, area right behind
forehead, which, not incidentally, prefrontal cortex, cases
people will focus breathing, movement stomach movement
diaphragm lifting chest extension belly
breathe. that, taking ordinarily perceptual state split
outside world, exteroception, usually also toward inner state.
know, people generally touch feeling skin inward
also paying attention outside them. can think
somebody, instance, restaurant sandwich shop order sandwich
reading menu, exteroception, right? menu outside
confines skin. little ideas maybe big ideas come mind
roast beef sandwich vegetarian sandwich will taste like, will you,
it, like, don't like, et cetera. splitting interoception
exteroception. close eyes, stop, slow down, focus
breathing third eye center, majority perception shifts
interoception. shift end continuum interoception,
something important happens. happens two regions, ACC,
anterior cingulate cortex, insula, really ramp levels neural activity,


make perfect sense areas brain
registering paying attention various sensations full empty
stomach feels, whether not surface skin feels hot cold, on.
just sitting lying closing eyes, brain undergoes
massive shift exteroception interoception. Now, not say can't
distracted external events, and, fact, many people are, early stages
transitioning meditative state involve shift continuum, or,
say, one end continuum no down-up, just
continuum, shift along continuum heightened levels interoception. Now,
mentioned briefly before, many people interoceptively aware just
naturally, even don't meditation practice. people not.
pretty good measure whether not high levels interoceptive awareness
capability, ability count heartbeats without placing fingers
anywhere pressure take pulse. can like, can
actually try estimate number heartbeats simply trying feel heart
beat. people good, meaning accurate this,
people not. seem ability can trained quite bit, and,
fact, meditative practices will improve interoceptive awareness, but,
important point, heightened levels interoceptive awareness, might
sound attractive, oh, really touch body, not always beneficial,

default mode network collection different brain areas essentially

thoughts drifting past present future. Remember, earlier, talked
perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,
present, future two three things, okay? Just like
attentional spotlighting, can place mind, thinking, memory,
cognition onto one things very, present past present

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment

got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near

pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can

drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales

exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],

going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.

make interoceptively aware. think back earlier

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice
reducing inflammatory cytokines, even improving outcomes cancer, reducing pain,
improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly
impact heart rate breathing. yanked around every experience.
instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person
environment breaking crying, yes, sad, important
sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, not get pulled
experience much lose ourselves. course areas

insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,
scared also going scared. push-pull
recognition distinct entities also, course, healthy desire
attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay

people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding

will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations

operational definition scientists call it. However, discussions consciousness
often part parcel conversations things like psychedelics kind
alternative therapies. 1960s especially 1970s, meditation
psychedelics actually close cousins conversation consciousness
states mind. conversation started split two different divisions,
explain moment. gets little bit interesting academic sociology.
happened couple guys Harvard, including Timothy Leary
others, got really interested psychedelics, particular LSD, lysergic acid
diethylamide. time, part whole counterculture movement,
considered anti-establishment, really encouraging students
Harvard take LSD. also interested meditation. ended
happening essentially got kicked fired Harvard, book
refer show note captions interested learning
this. got kicked fired emphasis psychedelics. Now,
nowadays, lot interest psychedelics. episodes Dr. Matthew
Johnson Johns Hopkins University running clinical trials psychedelics like
psilocybin LSD treatment depression PTSD. also Dr. Nolan
Williams podcast, colleague Stanford incredible studies
compounds well. nowadays, conversation psychedelics
coming back, somewhat divorced conversation meditation,
1960s 1970s, conversation psychedelics meditation sort
one same. changed late 1980s early 1990s people like
Jon Kabat-Zinn started writing books purely meditation suggesting
people explore meditative practices utility bring calmness, adjust stress,
improve sleep, et cetera, divorced conversation psychedelics. Now,
not say scientific community immediately embraced conversation
meditation. fact, took quite long schools like Harvard Stanford
universities around world start embracing funding studies meditation,
asking sorts brain areas involved, changes body, and, perhaps
importantly, meditation practice can shift brain body
somebody finished meditating off life everyday things.
late 1980s especially within 1990s, advent brain imaging technology like
magnetic residence imaging, MRI, functional magnetic residence imaging way
look brain active, not just get image structure, also


functioning areas so-called light up. technology
became accessible popular, well, allowed large number laboratories start
asking specific patterns thinking breathing, maybe people sitting lotus
position, often that, people inside MRI magnet
magnet, sort put little tube push tube, not
will course, put people tube, meditate, look
brain changed time. studies done,
discovered really quite miraculous, really. now don't think
surprising, discovered huge laundry list brain changes.
people evaluated outside life, fill reports
subjective feelings happiness report sleep, even objective
measures taken like changes hormones markers inflammation, et cetera,
large list information fell revealed indeed many,
dozen clear benefits regular meditation practice,
meditation practices quite short. nowadays, think meditation pretty
commonly accepted, fact, lot fact many major
tech companies Bay Area 2000s Google Apple
number different social media companies companies business
ventures, et cetera, investment firms world started hiring people train
meditation online courses meditation. nowadays, think meditation
thing almost everybody understands can benefit us, now sit
interesting frontier people think meditation one thing, sort like
word exercise, which, course, mean weight training, mean running,
mean high-intensity interval training, which, know, will get
different results depending do, often it, specifics
actually do. So, too, meditation can give specific results. can give
focus, can give better sleep, can give combination results just
like exercise can depending exercise. going talk next
specific changes happen brain specific aspects meditation. is,
happens close eyes, happens focus attention
inward versus focusing attention outward because, mentioned before,
third eye meditation close eyes focus spot just behind
forehead focus breathing. also meditation practices
focusing eating lot so-called mindfulness,


present whatever's happening, not letting mind wander think yesterday
tomorrow happening next, really focusing present. also
meditation practices, course, format interpersonal
communication really listening intensely. That, too, form
mindfulness. going parse things, going ask
happening brain body meditation practices
can develop specific meditation practices can invoke real life
daily basis or, thankfully, say, pretty busy,

00:16:19 Brain Interprets Body & Surrounding Environment; Mindfulness

even week even month will still clearly benefit
specific ways. like spend next 10 minutes talking
neuroscience meditation, promise not going just list off bunch
different brain areas active meditation. wouldn't useful you.
fact, don't believe throwing lot nomenclature without also giving
mechanistic explanation different brain areas do. say, "Well,
good knowing different brain areas names can't actually
manipulate brain areas?" good news actually can manipulate
brain areas. tell today, can turn activity certain brain areas
turn activity specific brain areas specific elements meditation
practice, quite exciting quite different really aspects
neuroscience might discuss podcast. different brain
areas whose names like arm with. again, names aren't
essential, can grasp even top contour say,
much better position parse use information follows. area
brain sits right behind forehead called prefrontal cortex.
Basically, front bumper head just behind bone, okay? area just
behind forehead call prefrontal cortex actually encompasses lot
different things. actually, two them. one right side
brain one left side brain, connected one
another actually different things. area like focus today
bit so-called left prefrontal cortex, going get really specific,
say left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Dorsal means up, lateral means side,


want touch left side head move hand just toward
midline, toward sort top head little bit, dorsal, lateral,
long hand still side head, left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, okay? got hand probably right left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. area brain, know lesion studies
damaged animals humans know stimulation studies
selectively stimulated animals, yes, indeed, also done humans,
incredible ability control bodily senses make sense, is,
interpret going terms emotions bodily sensations.
now on, unless say otherwise, say prefrontal cortex, specifically referring
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, going shorten just sake
simplicity ease communication. going talk another area prefrontal
cortex, talk another area, say prefrontal cortex today, mean left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Stimulation left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or,
say appropriately, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex active,
great position interpret going emotionally, interpret bodily
signals comfort discomfort, make really good decisions basis
interpretation. left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex direct
communication directly connected another brain area called anterior
cingulate cortex, ACC. Now, just going refer ACC, okay? ACC
area brain interpreting lot different things bodily signals,
instance, fast breathing, whether not heart beating quickly
slowly, and, importantly, whether not heart beating quickly slowly
circumstance in. instance, running hill
even great shape heart beating fast, unlikely going
concerned heart beating fast appropriate
circumstance. However, just walking along sudden, heart starts
beating quickly no apparent reason, well, going interpret
either pathologic uncomfortable, inappropriate context happen
in. left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex area brain actually
control especially can interpret going ACC region. Now,
probably haven't heard ACC. probably heard brain
area called amygdala. almond-shaped structure two sides brain,
people talk fear center, et cetera. ACC, anterior cingulate


cortex, gets input areas like amygdala, threat detection centers, also
gets input enormous number areas brain body, including
heart, gut, gets information full, is, distended,
empty gut is. gets information quickly breathing input
lungs related structures. absolutely critical station making sense
going body, works closely along one structure.
promise going third structure triad, stop listing
off names. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Think sort
interpreter going inside you. ACC, anterior cingulate
cortex, area brain bringing information
going inside body even surface body. know,
pain itch mosquito bite surface body, ACC
definitely register that. absolutely incredible brain structure
called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A, insula, insula bunch different
parts it. insula another area interpreting signals going
brain body, ACC insula working together try figure
out, know, going inside me? addition that, insula
interpreting information going outside you. insula saying,
instance, hey, steep hill running up, consequence, whatever
heart rate increase experiencing heavy breathing burning lungs,
makes sense. don't worried, don't scared. might want
slow down, makes sense. Whereas, instance, example previously
gave, sitting room everything pretty calm, sudden,
start feeling really uncomfortable, like stomach doesn't feel right start
breathing quickly start so-called anxiety panic attack, large part,
shift bodily sensations doesn't match doesn't correspond
something outside world. incredible triad includes left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate anterior cingulate cortex, insula,
three working together kind conversation, neural conversation,
conversation nonetheless, trying figure out, okay, going inside me?
feel? thinking about? thoughts past
future present. also conversation whether not
sensations experiencing, meaning quick breathing slow
breathing is, heart feels, skin feels, sensations pain,


pleasure matter, whether not makes sense situation
trying determine whether not right things consequence
sensations. Okay, again, can't remember names different
neural structures brain, don't worry it. really not critical.
critical understand conversation constantly occurring
long awake trying figure going inside whether
not makes sense relative going outside around you. Now, humans
smart. is, are, extent, conscious fact memories
past, awareness present, anticipation future. realize,
instance, can seated dinner table, excuse me, thought
something tomorrow, maybe exam stressing us something like
that, will change bodily state way not optimal
moment can still make sense us exam important,
maybe feeling pressure hard conversation have,
maybe excited next day can't eat
excited, can make perfect sense us access
knowledge self can think past, present, future.
makes conversation three structures even interesting dynamic
means can something, eating, talking, running,
number different activities, bodily state may may not match
way adaptive that, yet can completely okay least
understandable us. Now, major emphasis meditation practice make us so-
called mindful. mindfulness? Well, again, isn't one perfect universally
accepted operational definition mindfulness. basically nerd speak saying
people can't agree exactly mindfulness be, is, means everyone.
people assume, think agree, mindfulness includes something
present. say present, doesn't necessarily mean present one's
surroundings course lot meditation practices designed make
us mindful present designed make us mindful present
happening internally ignoring everything happening externally,
designed make us present

00:26:07 Neuroscience Meditation; Perceptual Spotlights



bodily sensations and, particular, breathing thoughts
moment. now explore generic meditation practice looks like,
evaluate tends change activity neural circuits brain
body. there, can split conversation couple different bins,
is, meditation practices ideal enhancing focus, meditation practices
ideal improving mood, meditation practices ideal improving sleep,
meditation practices that, believe not, benefit things one fell swoop.
Okay, happens meditation practice neural level? order
answer question, going scientists. means going
scientists now. going break practice different component
parts address know sure brain activation states occur
different component parts. order that, use somewhat generic
form meditation, generic pretty far-reaching say
people, 75%, say, meditation practice going involve stopping,
meaning getting motion, sitting lying down, and, cases, closing one's
eyes, although absolutely not required close one's eyes meditation.
many forms meditation done eyes open. people, going
involve stopping movement, is, not ambulating, not walking running,
seated lying eyes closed. that, meaning sit lie
close eyes, trivial shift might sound you, actually
profound shift way brain neural circuits body function
following reason. close eyes, shut major avenue
called exteroception. mean exteroception? Well, briefly,
sensing things body body time. also sensing things
outside us time, sights sounds, touch body,
sensations withinside body, et cetera. Now, sensation distinct call
perception. Perception is, put simply, sensations happen paying
attention to. given moment, sensing many, many things.
sound waves hitting ears, pressure receptors bottoms feet
sensing shoes sandals floor, et cetera, not perceiving
place attention them. Now, way perception works
so-called spotlights attention. can't perceive everything once, every sound,
every sight, every touch. overwhelming. fact, terrible.
Rather spotlights perception can either narrow, instance,


focus perception right now big toe right foot
really pour awareness, attention perceiving there,
feels like, tingling pressure, heat cold, et cetera, can broaden
spotlight include feet toes feet legs
whole body entire room. Perception like spotlight, mention
good data can split attention two probably not
two spotlights, can make spotlights perception either broad
diffuse narrow. can practice now like. can pick spot
wall away anywhere, driving, can look location,
can focus intensely one small location, instance, tree horizon
person street number different things outside you, can broaden
spotlight include entire scene once. can also focus spotlight
perception body, say left upper portion chest. course
can focus left upper portion chest something outside you, can
split attention two perceptual spotlights. hard, although not
impossible, three perceptual spotlights, people can split two points
attention perception pretty easily. thing people can pretty
easily merge two spotlights or, rather, just one spotlight attention.
don't always two spotlights attention on, here, using
word attention perception interchangeably. could, instance, two
points attention, talking somebody paying attention whether
not somebody's walking door not, two, completely
focused person talking to, completely focused
stomach ache great sensation hunger belly talking
somebody, fact, not even listening saying all. Okay?
two spotlights perception. can split merge one. And,
important, spotlights perception can intensify dim, there,
using analogy. mean perception happening within
spotlights can very, high acuity. is, can register fine changes
detail like tingling one side big toe right foot versus other, can
somewhat diffuse. just thinking whole toe, which,
case, seems like small area, point can consciously adjust acuity,
is, fineness perception. power
incredible ability brain structure whose name now understand know,


left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, although areas brain
involved well. ability direct attention specific things
environment within body split points attention merge dial
intensity closely paying attention every little shift ripple
change sensation kind dissociate, will, lack better word,
disengage perception, control ability

look example happens sit lie close eyes
decide meditate, immediately realize tremendous shift
perceptual ability, why? spotlight attention, can oriented
toward, instance, hear room maybe feeling wind moving


trees environment happen in, close eyes, shut
one major avenues sensory input, vision. that,
tendency perceptual spotlights focused
happens level surface skin inside bodies. informs
us something important, actually two axes two ends
continuum perception. now, talking perception
intention kind thing, indeed are, least sake
conversation, within word perception within word attention,
continuum, continuum one end something called interoception.
Interoception, spelled I, everything sense level skin
inward, sensation inside stomach, sensation heart beating.
people can sense heart beating pretty easily. people challenge
that. feeling surface skin, hot cold feel,
interoception. contrast, end continuum so-called exteroception,
spelled E. Exteroception perception everything outside beyond
confines skin. shutting eyes, particular, meditative practice
direct attention toward so-called third eye center, area right behind
forehead, which, not incidentally, prefrontal cortex, cases
people will focus breathing, movement stomach movement
diaphragm lifting chest extension belly
breathe. that, taking ordinarily perceptual state split
outside world, exteroception, usually also toward inner state.
know, people generally touch feeling skin inward
also paying attention outside them. can think
somebody, instance, restaurant sandwich shop order sandwich
reading menu, exteroception, right? menu outside
confines skin. little ideas maybe big ideas come mind
roast beef sandwich vegetarian sandwich will taste like, will you,
it, like, don't like, et cetera. splitting interoception
exteroception. close eyes, stop, slow down, focus
breathing third eye center, majority perception shifts
interoception. shift end continuum interoception,
something important happens. happens two regions, ACC,
anterior cingulate cortex, insula, really ramp levels neural activity,


make perfect sense areas brain
registering paying attention various sensations full empty
stomach feels, whether not surface skin feels hot cold, on.
just sitting lying closing eyes, brain undergoes
massive shift exteroception interoception. Now, not say can't
distracted external events, and, fact, many people are, early stages
transitioning meditative state involve shift continuum, or,
say, one end continuum no down-up, just
continuum, shift along continuum heightened levels interoception. Now,
mentioned briefly before, many people interoceptively aware just
naturally, even don't meditation practice. people not.
pretty good measure whether not high levels interoceptive awareness
capability, ability count heartbeats without placing fingers
anywhere pressure take pulse. can like, can
actually try estimate number heartbeats simply trying feel heart
beat. people good, meaning accurate this,
people not. seem ability can trained quite bit, and,
fact, meditative practices will improve interoceptive awareness, but,
important point, heightened levels interoceptive awareness, might
sound attractive, oh, really touch body, not always beneficial,
why? many people who, instance, excessive levels anxiety
excessive levels anxiety keenly aware subtle shift
heart rate breathing change sensations within stomach. Whereas
people less aware bodily state, can beneficial, right? can
adaptive not, depending circumstances. probably not adaptive
very, aware internal state if, instance, public speaking,
don't want thinking going stomach quickly
breathing. certainly trying ignore signals, sensations now.
somebody no awareness going on, little interoceptive awareness,
can problematic, too, people can ignore fact
heart attack can ignore fact high blood
pressure carrying life focused everything external no awareness
body. They're, quote, unquote, touch body. want
careful placing valence, sort value good bad


interoceptive awareness versus exteroceptive awareness. importantly, want
emphasize undergo meditation practice, sort stop
movement close eyes, training interoceptive awareness.
becomes important later get discussions meditation reducing
anxiety. people may opt, fact, say people opt
meditative practice involves exteroceptive awareness, actually meditation
like walking meditation even seated meditation bringing focus
place outside body opposed inside body. fact,
examples people meditated quite lot develop heightened
state awareness interoceptive components, is, just fancy, again, nerd
speak aware breathing heart state gut
actually intrusive daily activities. will ask ask question
now. somebody tends touch bodily sensations, so,
instance, skin inwards? somebody tends less touch
aware interoceptive state? no right wrong answer. don't
get F D C depending answer. just good question
every one us answer, think people will answer depends.
depends whether not social setting whether not alone.
going return answer keep mind will become
beneficial building optimal meditation practice you. now, just note,
continuum perception, interoception exteroception. Closing eyes
increases interoception. Opening eyes dramatically increases exteroception just
automatically, just automatically much brain, fact, 40% more,
dedicated vision. this, say, low vision no
vision blind poor vision, entire process
translated auditory, sound domain, true people can see
true people can't see. course, people can't see, closing eyes
doesn't huge shift towards interoception, studies,
not many would've liked find, studies of, instance, people
blind low vision, don't see well, close ears
can't hear external world put headphones noise-canceling headphones,

world inside becomes prominent relative world outside
obvious reasons. asked ask whether not
somebody tends interoceptively aware not, exteroceptively
aware not. might not able answer question,
can't, chances effectively sliding along continuum depending
activities doing. probably kind person somebody
comes starts talking you, will engage conversation,
don't feel inside body thinking heart beating
whether not flushing red, et cetera, going pay attention
say. Many people, however, somebody talks them, social anxiety
even slight bit social anxiety, will thinking whether not cheeks
flushing whether not look right sound right whether not

exteroceptive awareness. And, course, context dependent. will depend
whether not you're, know, date somebody that, know,
loathe find later food teeth whether not
somebody familiar not really matter much
person tell kind thing. mean one location
another location along continuum interoception exteroception? Well, know
means neurally, right? know interoceptively aware,
insula ACC active, not useful. not helpful tool.
just fact. Now, actually studies meditation practice can
terms moving along continuum naturally sit order help
function not just meditation times. order illustrate this,
want start description now classic study. cool study,
cool name. talks something important will come
today's conversation, something called default mode network.
default mode network collection different brain areas essentially
active not much anything certainly active not
focused one particular task conversation activity. default mode network can
thought less network generates mind wandering
thoughts drifting past present future. Remember, earlier, talked
perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,
present, future two three things, okay? Just like
attentional spotlighting, can place mind, thinking, memory,
cognition onto one things very, present past present
forth. default mode network, involves lot different brain
areas, can thought simply network brain areas active
mind wandering different time domains. paper like share
you, mentioned before, now classic paper, wonderful title,
Wandering Mind Unhappy Mind. Now, sounds almost like news article
news article scientific paper, actually title scientific paper
published journal, "Science," one three apex journals.
know, scientific publishing competitive, especially competitive get

represents kind Super Bowl, NBA Championships, Stanley Cup, will,
sports aficionados scientific publishing. paper Matthew
Killingsworth Dan Gilbert. published 2010, still considered classic.
paper, Wandering Mind Unhappy Mind, number important
points. going paraphrase certain elements say
essentially like know far better say. first all,
started statement, confess disagree with, is, "Unlike
animals, human beings spend lot time thinking not going around
them: contemplating events happened past, might happen future, will
never happen all." agree assertion human beings that.
certainly experience, although must say, don't think evidence
whatsoever animals don't also. apologies, Killingsworth
Gilbert, happy go toe-to-toe that. not aware data
prove one way animals thinking. set aside


animals, focus human animal. Now, point still good one,
humans wandering mind call stimulus-
independent thought. is, nothing happening create thoughts
anything happening immediate environment. thoughts just happening
internally. default mode network. study important.
fact, landmark study right time smartphones
became widely available use, again, 2010. basically pinged people,
contacted people iPhones many times per day, well
2,200 adults. mix male female people study. mean

unpleasant. brings us tool, tool us can use
whether not tend interoceptively dominant, right, tend pay
attention bodily sensations, exteroceptively dominant. And, again, don't
know answer question, simple test can do. can just sit
lie down, close eyes, can ask assess whether not

well rested are, et cetera, exactly point. sort thing
want every time decide meditation practice. fact, suggest
use determine meditation given moment. say
somebody regular meditator say somebody never

please don't close eyes driving, sort obvious, safe
way, please. stop, close eyes, assess whether not can access
focus attention primarily internal state whether not attention
perception gets pulled something external, exteroception. And, again, will vary
depending circumstance are. suggest opening eyes
trying focus attention something external seeing evaluating
extent can divorce perception sensations occur level
skin internally. Now, say no technology, least not
aware of, absence fMRI machine, case, inside fMRI machine


this. unless experiment, us aren't, no
technology can tell you, instance, whether not interoceptively

given moment. assess subjectively. However,
sit down, instance, notice can equally split attention
internal sensations external sensations whether not find
pulled external sensations trying focus inward find
pulled inward trying focus outward, well, will dictate sort
meditation perhaps perform moment. Let give example
this. stop way, sit lie down, close eyes,
evaluate whether not can essentially rule eliminate attention
outside events. people won't able entirely, try focus
attention, instance, breathing typical third eye center, know,
focusing spot right behind forehead. feel can reasonably well
exclusion happening around you, well, important question arises.
meditate way enhance interoceptive awareness? rather,
meditate way, instance, eyes open attention
particular portion landscape like tree maybe even, know,
object plant something else immediate environment try cultivate
enhance exteroceptive awareness? you, bias one
work default state. Again, default mode network
land interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum. going lead mind
wandering, whereas encourage even say force little bit
anchor attention either inside body outside body, make
decision according less easily, well, actively
training neural circuits. engaging so-called neuroplasticity, brain's
ability change response experience. deliberately engaging shift along
continuum. make crystal clear, mean this. Let give example.
sit wanted meditation, just say three minutes
meditation. good evidence even three minutes meditation can
beneficial variety things, including enhanced focus enhanced anxiety
management. say sit notice can really focus inward
happening level skin internal organs, can rule everything.
Maybe 'cause room quiet maybe just brain state


particularly good moment maybe just natural ability. Well
opt three-minute meditation practice deliberately exterocept,
build circuitry focus something external want,
think people like, adaptive mechanism within

internally kept getting distracted things happening outside me, opening
eyes feeling like need reach phone paying attention sounds
room, well, actively engage meditation practice, case, three-
minute example longer, deliberately trying focus
perception events level confines skin internally. say
this? Well, know, love use phrase anytime kids, know,
say "This really hard something's challenging," adults will say, "That's really
tough." Well, graduate advisor used say, means learning.

absolutely zero reason neural circuits change. friction,
feeling something hard turns enormous variety mechanisms
level cells, et cetera, allow potentially change neural circuitry.

exteroceptive bias happens given moment. And, again, will change.
you, will change across day early day, very,
good interoceptive-biased meditation, later day, aren't.
actually believe, based data covered, get
papers this, lab actively working well, meditative

01:01:48 State & Trait Changes, Interoceptive & Exteroceptive Meditations, Refocusing

also can lead to, referred earlier, neuroplasticity, changes
brain circuits underlie default mode network lead called
trait changes. want clear not first make state versus
trait distinction. distinction raised really wonderful book. fact,
can't recommend book highly enough. book "Altered Traits: Science Reveals
Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body." book Daniel
Goleman Richard Davidson who've done terrific work many writings many
TED Talks, et cetera, meditation. say circa 2016, 2017, book
really captured believe essential elements science
meditation lot history well. Today, focusing much

Now, think people familiar interoceptive-biased meditation.
Again, setting timer. Maybe don't even set timer, just sit

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people

New York University's laboratory popularized, popularized
wonderful paper will provide link shows daily 13-minute

focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day

couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne

talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,
exhale, controlling duration inhale, breath hold, exhale, breath hold, repeat, so-
called box breathing inhale, hold, exhale, hold

box breathing, cadence three six seconds in, holding two seconds, seven
seconds out, regardless cadence breathing one uses, tendency
meditative practices slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing
deliberate fashion. essential default breathing, is,


don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces
us interoception. Why? diaphragm, muscle helps move
lungs essentially create specific cadence breathing depth breathing one
box breathing deliberately slow breathing, well, muscle resides inside

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice

cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous

drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales

exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],

going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.

make interoceptively aware. think back earlier

actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits

focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection

traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,

dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading

process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within

conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin

concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people
position action-oriented focused, et cetera, come
yoga nidra, certainly useful practice. form meditation, call
meditation-ish, yoga nidra NSDR not typically people think
talk meditation. course, episode meditation. reason
bring yoga nidra NSDR many people meditate enhance sleep
ability reduce total amount sleep need. appears meditation
probably not ideal comparison yoga nidra NSDR, meditation
excellent, not superb, adjusting default mode network toward happiness
mindful present

02:11:33 Choosing Meditative Practice; Hypnosis

placing oneself healthy model interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
covered lot information, like think given key
decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want
thing going allow feel rested tired going allow
adjust state mind not want whatever reason,
anxious exhausted, et cetera." people, say practice like


NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form
meditation. also want just remind everybody app guides meditation, also
information intention setting, Waking app Sam
Harris can immensely beneficial. certainly found beneficial. know millions
people well, encourage check out. talked
determining continuums interoception exteroception
order dictate particular type meditation practice given
moment, whether not focus vision inward eyes closed focus
vision attention outward key component, whether not
cyclic breathing, will allow focus off breathing somewhat
easier non-cyclic breathing, doubling inhales exhales,
whether not breathing going natural not. And, course, need
determine whether not meditation practice designed enhance level
focus relax you. say designed enhance level focus,
doesn't necessarily mean won't relaxing. slow cadence breathing
third eye meditation, relaxing, yet focus refocus
practice, whereas something like yoga nidra NSDR going along
lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing
sleep need. previous podcasts, talked hypnosis, particularly
episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get
hypnosis now, just understand hypnosis distinct breathwork, yoga
nidra, NSDR, meditation even though includes
components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual
attention outward inward go hypnosis, involves breathing
particular kind, involves specific imagery, et cetera. hypnosis distinct
hypnosis really designed fix address specific problem, whereas meditation,
NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically not. can help fix problems
anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, generally not directed toward particular
line thinking. can be, typically not. Whereas hypnosis almost
always, especially clinical context, not stage hypnosis, clinical context
lot research show can, instance, help quitting smoking,
literally quadrupling effectiveness smoking cessation something like
Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
reducing pain number things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis really


great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

functioning areas so-called light up. technology
became accessible popular, well, allowed large number laboratories start
asking specific patterns thinking breathing, maybe people sitting lotus
position, often that, people inside MRI magnet
magnet, sort put little tube push tube, not
will course, put people tube, meditate, look
brain changed time. studies done,
discovered really quite miraculous, really. now don't think
surprising, discovered huge laundry list brain changes.
people evaluated outside life, fill reports
subjective feelings happiness report sleep, even objective
measures taken like changes hormones markers inflammation, et cetera,
large list information fell revealed indeed many,
dozen clear benefits regular meditation practice,
meditation practices quite short. nowadays, think meditation pretty
commonly accepted, fact, lot fact many major
tech companies Bay Area 2000s Google Apple
number different social media companies companies business
ventures, et cetera, investment firms world started hiring people train
meditation online courses meditation. nowadays, think meditation
thing almost everybody understands can benefit us, now sit
interesting frontier people think meditation one thing, sort like
word exercise, which, course, mean weight training, mean running,
mean high-intensity interval training, which, know, will get
different results depending do, often it, specifics
actually do. So, too, meditation can give specific results. can give
focus, can give better sleep, can give combination results just
like exercise can depending exercise. going talk next
specific changes happen brain specific aspects meditation. is,
happens close eyes, happens focus attention
inward versus focusing attention outward because, mentioned before,
third eye meditation close eyes focus spot just behind
forehead focus breathing. also meditation practices
focusing eating lot so-called mindfulness,


present whatever's happening, not letting mind wander think yesterday
tomorrow happening next, really focusing present. also
meditation practices, course, format interpersonal
communication really listening intensely. That, too, form
mindfulness. going parse things, going ask
happening brain body meditation practices
can develop specific meditation practices can invoke real life
daily basis or, thankfully, say, pretty busy,

00:16:19 Brain Interprets Body & Surrounding Environment; Mindfulness

even week even month will still clearly benefit
specific ways. like spend next 10 minutes talking
neuroscience meditation, promise not going just list off bunch
different brain areas active meditation. wouldn't useful you.
fact, don't believe throwing lot nomenclature without also giving
mechanistic explanation different brain areas do. say, "Well,
good knowing different brain areas names can't actually
manipulate brain areas?" good news actually can manipulate
brain areas. tell today, can turn activity certain brain areas
turn activity specific brain areas specific elements meditation
practice, quite exciting quite different really aspects
neuroscience might discuss podcast. different brain
areas whose names like arm with. again, names aren't
essential, can grasp even top contour say,
much better position parse use information follows. area
brain sits right behind forehead called prefrontal cortex.
Basically, front bumper head just behind bone, okay? area just
behind forehead call prefrontal cortex actually encompasses lot
different things. actually, two them. one right side
brain one left side brain, connected one
another actually different things. area like focus today
bit so-called left prefrontal cortex, going get really specific,
say left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Dorsal means up, lateral means side,


want touch left side head move hand just toward
midline, toward sort top head little bit, dorsal, lateral,
long hand still side head, left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, okay? got hand probably right left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. area brain, know lesion studies
damaged animals humans know stimulation studies
selectively stimulated animals, yes, indeed, also done humans,
incredible ability control bodily senses make sense, is,
interpret going terms emotions bodily sensations.
now on, unless say otherwise, say prefrontal cortex, specifically referring
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, going shorten just sake
simplicity ease communication. going talk another area prefrontal
cortex, talk another area, say prefrontal cortex today, mean left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Stimulation left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or,
say appropriately, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex active,
great position interpret going emotionally, interpret bodily
signals comfort discomfort, make really good decisions basis
interpretation. left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex direct
communication directly connected another brain area called anterior
cingulate cortex, ACC. Now, just going refer ACC, okay? ACC
area brain interpreting lot different things bodily signals,
instance, fast breathing, whether not heart beating quickly
slowly, and, importantly, whether not heart beating quickly slowly
circumstance in. instance, running hill
even great shape heart beating fast, unlikely going
concerned heart beating fast appropriate
circumstance. However, just walking along sudden, heart starts
beating quickly no apparent reason, well, going interpret
either pathologic uncomfortable, inappropriate context happen
in. left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex area brain actually
control especially can interpret going ACC region. Now,
probably haven't heard ACC. probably heard brain
area called amygdala. almond-shaped structure two sides brain,
people talk fear center, et cetera. ACC, anterior cingulate


cortex, gets input areas like amygdala, threat detection centers, also
gets input enormous number areas brain body, including
heart, gut, gets information full, is, distended,
empty gut is. gets information quickly breathing input
lungs related structures. absolutely critical station making sense
going body, works closely along one structure.
promise going third structure triad, stop listing
off names. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Think sort
interpreter going inside you. ACC, anterior cingulate
cortex, area brain bringing information
going inside body even surface body. know,
pain itch mosquito bite surface body, ACC
definitely register that. absolutely incredible brain structure
called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A, insula, insula bunch different
parts it. insula another area interpreting signals going
brain body, ACC insula working together try figure
out, know, going inside me? addition that, insula
interpreting information going outside you. insula saying,
instance, hey, steep hill running up, consequence, whatever
heart rate increase experiencing heavy breathing burning lungs,
makes sense. don't worried, don't scared. might want
slow down, makes sense. Whereas, instance, example previously
gave, sitting room everything pretty calm, sudden,
start feeling really uncomfortable, like stomach doesn't feel right start
breathing quickly start so-called anxiety panic attack, large part,
shift bodily sensations doesn't match doesn't correspond
something outside world. incredible triad includes left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate anterior cingulate cortex, insula,
three working together kind conversation, neural conversation,
conversation nonetheless, trying figure out, okay, going inside me?
feel? thinking about? thoughts past
future present. also conversation whether not
sensations experiencing, meaning quick breathing slow
breathing is, heart feels, skin feels, sensations pain,


pleasure matter, whether not makes sense situation
trying determine whether not right things consequence
sensations. Okay, again, can't remember names different
neural structures brain, don't worry it. really not critical.
critical understand conversation constantly occurring
long awake trying figure going inside whether
not makes sense relative going outside around you. Now, humans
smart. is, are, extent, conscious fact memories
past, awareness present, anticipation future. realize,
instance, can seated dinner table, excuse me, thought
something tomorrow, maybe exam stressing us something like
that, will change bodily state way not optimal
moment can still make sense us exam important,
maybe feeling pressure hard conversation have,
maybe excited next day can't eat
excited, can make perfect sense us access
knowledge self can think past, present, future.
makes conversation three structures even interesting dynamic
means can something, eating, talking, running,
number different activities, bodily state may may not match
way adaptive that, yet can completely okay least
understandable us. Now, major emphasis meditation practice make us so-
called mindful. mindfulness? Well, again, isn't one perfect universally
accepted operational definition mindfulness. basically nerd speak saying
people can't agree exactly mindfulness be, is, means everyone.
people assume, think agree, mindfulness includes something
present. say present, doesn't necessarily mean present one's
surroundings course lot meditation practices designed make
us mindful present designed make us mindful present
happening internally ignoring everything happening externally,
designed make us present

00:26:07 Neuroscience Meditation; Perceptual Spotlights



bodily sensations and, particular, breathing thoughts
moment. now explore generic meditation practice looks like,
evaluate tends change activity neural circuits brain
body. there, can split conversation couple different bins,
is, meditation practices ideal enhancing focus, meditation practices
ideal improving mood, meditation practices ideal improving sleep,
meditation practices that, believe not, benefit things one fell swoop.
Okay, happens meditation practice neural level? order
answer question, going scientists. means going
scientists now. going break practice different component
parts address know sure brain activation states occur
different component parts. order that, use somewhat generic
form meditation, generic pretty far-reaching say
people, 75%, say, meditation practice going involve stopping,
meaning getting motion, sitting lying down, and, cases, closing one's
eyes, although absolutely not required close one's eyes meditation.
many forms meditation done eyes open. people, going
involve stopping movement, is, not ambulating, not walking running,
seated lying eyes closed. that, meaning sit lie
close eyes, trivial shift might sound you, actually
profound shift way brain neural circuits body function
following reason. close eyes, shut major avenue
called exteroception. mean exteroception? Well, briefly,
sensing things body body time. also sensing things
outside us time, sights sounds, touch body,
sensations withinside body, et cetera. Now, sensation distinct call
perception. Perception is, put simply, sensations happen paying
attention to. given moment, sensing many, many things.
sound waves hitting ears, pressure receptors bottoms feet
sensing shoes sandals floor, et cetera, not perceiving
place attention them. Now, way perception works
so-called spotlights attention. can't perceive everything once, every sound,
every sight, every touch. overwhelming. fact, terrible.
Rather spotlights perception can either narrow, instance,


focus perception right now big toe right foot
really pour awareness, attention perceiving there,
feels like, tingling pressure, heat cold, et cetera, can broaden
spotlight include feet toes feet legs
whole body entire room. Perception like spotlight, mention
good data can split attention two probably not
two spotlights, can make spotlights perception either broad
diffuse narrow. can practice now like. can pick spot
wall away anywhere, driving, can look location,
can focus intensely one small location, instance, tree horizon
person street number different things outside you, can broaden
spotlight include entire scene once. can also focus spotlight
perception body, say left upper portion chest. course
can focus left upper portion chest something outside you, can
split attention two perceptual spotlights. hard, although not
impossible, three perceptual spotlights, people can split two points
attention perception pretty easily. thing people can pretty
easily merge two spotlights or, rather, just one spotlight attention.
don't always two spotlights attention on, here, using
word attention perception interchangeably. could, instance, two
points attention, talking somebody paying attention whether
not somebody's walking door not, two, completely
focused person talking to, completely focused
stomach ache great sensation hunger belly talking
somebody, fact, not even listening saying all. Okay?
two spotlights perception. can split merge one. And,
important, spotlights perception can intensify dim, there,
using analogy. mean perception happening within
spotlights can very, high acuity. is, can register fine changes
detail like tingling one side big toe right foot versus other, can
somewhat diffuse. just thinking whole toe, which,
case, seems like small area, point can consciously adjust acuity,
is, fineness perception. power
incredible ability brain structure whose name now understand know,


left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, although areas brain
involved well. ability direct attention specific things
environment within body split points attention merge dial
intensity closely paying attention every little shift ripple
change sensation kind dissociate, will, lack better word,
disengage perception, control ability

continuum perception. now, talking perception

conversation, within word perception within word attention,
continuum, continuum one end something called interoception.
Interoception, spelled I, everything sense level skin

people can sense heart beating pretty easily. people challenge
that. feeling surface skin, hot cold feel,
interoception. contrast, end continuum so-called exteroception,
spelled E. Exteroception perception everything outside beyond

outside world, exteroception, usually also toward inner state.
know, people generally touch feeling skin inward
also paying attention outside them. can think
somebody, instance, restaurant sandwich shop order sandwich

just sitting lying closing eyes, brain undergoes
massive shift exteroception interoception. Now, not say can't
distracted external events, and, fact, many people are, early stages
transitioning meditative state involve shift continuum, or,
say, one end continuum no down-up, just

mentioned briefly before, many people interoceptively aware just
naturally, even don't meditation practice. people not.
pretty good measure whether not high levels interoceptive awareness

actually try estimate number heartbeats simply trying feel heart

people not. seem ability can trained quite bit, and,
fact, meditative practices will improve interoceptive awareness, but,
important point, heightened levels interoceptive awareness, might
sound attractive, oh, really touch body, not always beneficial,
why? many people who, instance, excessive levels anxiety

cool name. talks something important will come
today's conversation, something called default mode network.
default mode network collection different brain areas essentially
active not much anything certainly active not
focused one particular task conversation activity. default mode network can
thought less network generates mind wandering
thoughts drifting past present future. Remember, earlier, talked
perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,
present, future two three things, okay? Just like
attentional spotlighting, can place mind, thinking, memory,
cognition onto one things very, present past present
forth. default mode network, involves lot different brain
areas, can thought simply network brain areas active

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people

reason arrive somewhat disorganized fashion because, normally,
just don't perceive things way. Normally, splitting attention,

focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day
meditation. However, trying establish long meditate, ask
couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate

different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic

general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic

don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,

meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible

continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin

bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental

Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,

thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense

meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,

Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,

typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,

people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases

peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast

close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research

happening brain body meditation practices
can develop specific meditation practices can invoke real life
daily basis or, thankfully, say, pretty busy,

00:16:19 Brain Interprets Body & Surrounding Environment; Mindfulness

even week even month will still clearly benefit
specific ways. like spend next 10 minutes talking
neuroscience meditation, promise not going just list off bunch
different brain areas active meditation. wouldn't useful you.
fact, don't believe throwing lot nomenclature without also giving
mechanistic explanation different brain areas do. say, "Well,
good knowing different brain areas names can't actually
manipulate brain areas?" good news actually can manipulate
brain areas. tell today, can turn activity certain brain areas
turn activity specific brain areas specific elements meditation
practice, quite exciting quite different really aspects
neuroscience might discuss podcast. different brain
areas whose names like arm with. again, names aren't
essential, can grasp even top contour say,
much better position parse use information follows. area
brain sits right behind forehead called prefrontal cortex.
Basically, front bumper head just behind bone, okay? area just
behind forehead call prefrontal cortex actually encompasses lot
different things. actually, two them. one right side
brain one left side brain, connected one
another actually different things. area like focus today
bit so-called left prefrontal cortex, going get really specific,
say left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Dorsal means up, lateral means side,


want touch left side head move hand just toward
midline, toward sort top head little bit, dorsal, lateral,
long hand still side head, left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, okay? got hand probably right left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. area brain, know lesion studies
damaged animals humans know stimulation studies
selectively stimulated animals, yes, indeed, also done humans,
incredible ability control bodily senses make sense, is,
interpret going terms emotions bodily sensations.
now on, unless say otherwise, say prefrontal cortex, specifically referring
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, going shorten just sake
simplicity ease communication. going talk another area prefrontal
cortex, talk another area, say prefrontal cortex today, mean left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Stimulation left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or,
say appropriately, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex active,
great position interpret going emotionally, interpret bodily
signals comfort discomfort, make really good decisions basis
interpretation. left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex direct
communication directly connected another brain area called anterior
cingulate cortex, ACC. Now, just going refer ACC, okay? ACC
area brain interpreting lot different things bodily signals,
instance, fast breathing, whether not heart beating quickly
slowly, and, importantly, whether not heart beating quickly slowly
circumstance in. instance, running hill
even great shape heart beating fast, unlikely going
concerned heart beating fast appropriate
circumstance. However, just walking along sudden, heart starts
beating quickly no apparent reason, well, going interpret
either pathologic uncomfortable, inappropriate context happen
in. left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex area brain actually
control especially can interpret going ACC region. Now,
probably haven't heard ACC. probably heard brain
area called amygdala. almond-shaped structure two sides brain,
people talk fear center, et cetera. ACC, anterior cingulate


cortex, gets input areas like amygdala, threat detection centers, also
gets input enormous number areas brain body, including
heart, gut, gets information full, is, distended,
empty gut is. gets information quickly breathing input
lungs related structures. absolutely critical station making sense
going body, works closely along one structure.
promise going third structure triad, stop listing
off names. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Think sort
interpreter going inside you. ACC, anterior cingulate
cortex, area brain bringing information
going inside body even surface body. know,
pain itch mosquito bite surface body, ACC
definitely register that. absolutely incredible brain structure
called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A, insula, insula bunch different
parts it. insula another area interpreting signals going
brain body, ACC insula working together try figure
out, know, going inside me? addition that, insula
interpreting information going outside you. insula saying,
instance, hey, steep hill running up, consequence, whatever
heart rate increase experiencing heavy breathing burning lungs,
makes sense. don't worried, don't scared. might want
slow down, makes sense. Whereas, instance, example previously
gave, sitting room everything pretty calm, sudden,
start feeling really uncomfortable, like stomach doesn't feel right start
breathing quickly start so-called anxiety panic attack, large part,
shift bodily sensations doesn't match doesn't correspond
something outside world. incredible triad includes left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate anterior cingulate cortex, insula,
three working together kind conversation, neural conversation,
conversation nonetheless, trying figure out, okay, going inside me?
feel? thinking about? thoughts past
future present. also conversation whether not
sensations experiencing, meaning quick breathing slow
breathing is, heart feels, skin feels, sensations pain,


pleasure matter, whether not makes sense situation
trying determine whether not right things consequence
sensations. Okay, again, can't remember names different
neural structures brain, don't worry it. really not critical.
critical understand conversation constantly occurring
long awake trying figure going inside whether
not makes sense relative going outside around you. Now, humans
smart. is, are, extent, conscious fact memories
past, awareness present, anticipation future. realize,
instance, can seated dinner table, excuse me, thought
something tomorrow, maybe exam stressing us something like
that, will change bodily state way not optimal
moment can still make sense us exam important,
maybe feeling pressure hard conversation have,
maybe excited next day can't eat
excited, can make perfect sense us access
knowledge self can think past, present, future.
makes conversation three structures even interesting dynamic
means can something, eating, talking, running,
number different activities, bodily state may may not match
way adaptive that, yet can completely okay least
understandable us. Now, major emphasis meditation practice make us so-
called mindful. mindfulness? Well, again, isn't one perfect universally
accepted operational definition mindfulness. basically nerd speak saying
people can't agree exactly mindfulness be, is, means everyone.
people assume, think agree, mindfulness includes something
present. say present, doesn't necessarily mean present one's
surroundings course lot meditation practices designed make
us mindful present designed make us mindful present
happening internally ignoring everything happening externally,
designed make us present

00:26:07 Neuroscience Meditation; Perceptual Spotlights



bodily sensations and, particular, breathing thoughts
moment. now explore generic meditation practice looks like,
evaluate tends change activity neural circuits brain
body. there, can split conversation couple different bins,
is, meditation practices ideal enhancing focus, meditation practices
ideal improving mood, meditation practices ideal improving sleep,
meditation practices that, believe not, benefit things one fell swoop.
Okay, happens meditation practice neural level? order
answer question, going scientists. means going
scientists now. going break practice different component
parts address know sure brain activation states occur
different component parts. order that, use somewhat generic
form meditation, generic pretty far-reaching say
people, 75%, say, meditation practice going involve stopping,
meaning getting motion, sitting lying down, and, cases, closing one's
eyes, although absolutely not required close one's eyes meditation.
many forms meditation done eyes open. people, going
involve stopping movement, is, not ambulating, not walking running,
seated lying eyes closed. that, meaning sit lie
close eyes, trivial shift might sound you, actually
profound shift way brain neural circuits body function
following reason. close eyes, shut major avenue
called exteroception. mean exteroception? Well, briefly,
sensing things body body time. also sensing things
outside us time, sights sounds, touch body,
sensations withinside body, et cetera. Now, sensation distinct call
perception. Perception is, put simply, sensations happen paying
attention to. given moment, sensing many, many things.
sound waves hitting ears, pressure receptors bottoms feet
sensing shoes sandals floor, et cetera, not perceiving
place attention them. Now, way perception works
so-called spotlights attention. can't perceive everything once, every sound,
every sight, every touch. overwhelming. fact, terrible.
Rather spotlights perception can either narrow, instance,


focus perception right now big toe right foot
really pour awareness, attention perceiving there,
feels like, tingling pressure, heat cold, et cetera, can broaden
spotlight include feet toes feet legs
whole body entire room. Perception like spotlight, mention
good data can split attention two probably not
two spotlights, can make spotlights perception either broad
diffuse narrow. can practice now like. can pick spot
wall away anywhere, driving, can look location,
can focus intensely one small location, instance, tree horizon
person street number different things outside you, can broaden
spotlight include entire scene once. can also focus spotlight
perception body, say left upper portion chest. course
can focus left upper portion chest something outside you, can
split attention two perceptual spotlights. hard, although not
impossible, three perceptual spotlights, people can split two points
attention perception pretty easily. thing people can pretty
easily merge two spotlights or, rather, just one spotlight attention.
don't always two spotlights attention on, here, using
word attention perception interchangeably. could, instance, two
points attention, talking somebody paying attention whether
not somebody's walking door not, two, completely
focused person talking to, completely focused
stomach ache great sensation hunger belly talking
somebody, fact, not even listening saying all. Okay?
two spotlights perception. can split merge one. And,
important, spotlights perception can intensify dim, there,
using analogy. mean perception happening within
spotlights can very, high acuity. is, can register fine changes
detail like tingling one side big toe right foot versus other, can
somewhat diffuse. just thinking whole toe, which,
case, seems like small area, point can consciously adjust acuity,
is, fineness perception. power
incredible ability brain structure whose name now understand know,


left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, although areas brain
involved well. ability direct attention specific things

look example happens sit lie close eyes
decide meditate, immediately realize tremendous shift
perceptual ability, why? spotlight attention, can oriented
toward, instance, hear room maybe feeling wind moving


trees environment happen in, close eyes, shut
one major avenues sensory input, vision. that,
tendency perceptual spotlights focused
happens level surface skin inside bodies. informs
us something important, actually two axes two ends
continuum perception. now, talking perception
intention kind thing, indeed are, least sake
conversation, within word perception within word attention,
continuum, continuum one end something called interoception.
Interoception, spelled I, everything sense level skin
inward, sensation inside stomach, sensation heart beating.
people can sense heart beating pretty easily. people challenge
that. feeling surface skin, hot cold feel,
interoception. contrast, end continuum so-called exteroception,
spelled E. Exteroception perception everything outside beyond
confines skin. shutting eyes, particular, meditative practice
direct attention toward so-called third eye center, area right behind
forehead, which, not incidentally, prefrontal cortex, cases
people will focus breathing, movement stomach movement
diaphragm lifting chest extension belly
breathe. that, taking ordinarily perceptual state split
outside world, exteroception, usually also toward inner state.
know, people generally touch feeling skin inward
also paying attention outside them. can think
somebody, instance, restaurant sandwich shop order sandwich
reading menu, exteroception, right? menu outside
confines skin. little ideas maybe big ideas come mind
roast beef sandwich vegetarian sandwich will taste like, will you,
it, like, don't like, et cetera. splitting interoception
exteroception. close eyes, stop, slow down, focus
breathing third eye center, majority perception shifts
interoception. shift end continuum interoception,
something important happens. happens two regions, ACC,
anterior cingulate cortex, insula, really ramp levels neural activity,


make perfect sense areas brain
registering paying attention various sensations full empty
stomach feels, whether not surface skin feels hot cold, on.
just sitting lying closing eyes, brain undergoes
massive shift exteroception interoception. Now, not say can't
distracted external events, and, fact, many people are, early stages
transitioning meditative state involve shift continuum, or,
say, one end continuum no down-up, just
continuum, shift along continuum heightened levels interoception. Now,
mentioned briefly before, many people interoceptively aware just
naturally, even don't meditation practice. people not.
pretty good measure whether not high levels interoceptive awareness
capability, ability count heartbeats without placing fingers
anywhere pressure take pulse. can like, can
actually try estimate number heartbeats simply trying feel heart
beat. people good, meaning accurate this,
people not. seem ability can trained quite bit, and,
fact, meditative practices will improve interoceptive awareness, but,
important point, heightened levels interoceptive awareness, might
sound attractive, oh, really touch body, not always beneficial,
why? many people who, instance, excessive levels anxiety
excessive levels anxiety keenly aware subtle shift
heart rate breathing change sensations within stomach. Whereas
people less aware bodily state, can beneficial, right? can
adaptive not, depending circumstances. probably not adaptive
very, aware internal state if, instance, public speaking,
don't want thinking going stomach quickly
breathing. certainly trying ignore signals, sensations now.
somebody no awareness going on, little interoceptive awareness,
can problematic, too, people can ignore fact
heart attack can ignore fact high blood
pressure carrying life focused everything external no awareness
body. They're, quote, unquote, touch body. want
careful placing valence, sort value good bad


interoceptive awareness versus exteroceptive awareness. importantly, want
emphasize undergo meditation practice, sort stop
movement close eyes, training interoceptive awareness.
becomes important later get discussions meditation reducing
anxiety. people may opt, fact, say people opt
meditative practice involves exteroceptive awareness, actually meditation
like walking meditation even seated meditation bringing focus
place outside body opposed inside body. fact,
examples people meditated quite lot develop heightened
state awareness interoceptive components, is, just fancy, again, nerd
speak aware breathing heart state gut
actually intrusive daily activities. will ask ask question
now. somebody tends touch bodily sensations, so,
instance, skin inwards? somebody tends less touch
aware interoceptive state? no right wrong answer. don't
get F D C depending answer. just good question
every one us answer, think people will answer depends.
depends whether not social setting whether not alone.
going return answer keep mind will become
beneficial building optimal meditation practice you. now, just note,
continuum perception, interoception exteroception. Closing eyes
increases interoception. Opening eyes dramatically increases exteroception just
automatically, just automatically much brain, fact, 40% more,
dedicated vision. this, say, low vision no
vision blind poor vision, entire process
translated auditory, sound domain, true people can see
true people can't see. course, people can't see, closing eyes
doesn't huge shift towards interoception, studies,
not many would've liked find, studies of, instance, people
blind low vision, don't see well, close ears
can't hear external world put headphones noise-canceling headphones,

00:42:20 Default Mode Network, Continuum Interoception & Exteroception



world inside becomes prominent relative world outside
obvious reasons. asked ask whether not
somebody tends interoceptively aware not, exteroceptively
aware not. might not able answer question,
can't, chances effectively sliding along continuum depending
activities doing. probably kind person somebody
comes starts talking you, will engage conversation,
don't feel inside body thinking heart beating
whether not flushing red, et cetera, going pay attention
say. Many people, however, somebody talks them, social anxiety
even slight bit social anxiety, will thinking whether not cheeks
flushing whether not look right sound right whether not
something teeth. normal responses, really speak issue
whether not tend shift towards interoceptive awareness
exteroceptive awareness. And, course, context dependent. will depend
whether not you're, know, date somebody that, know,
loathe find later food teeth whether not
somebody familiar not really matter much
person tell kind thing. mean one location
another location along continuum interoception exteroception? Well, know
means neurally, right? know interoceptively aware,
insula ACC active, not useful. not helpful tool.
just fact. Now, actually studies meditation practice can
terms moving along continuum naturally sit order help
function not just meditation times. order illustrate this,
want start description now classic study. cool study,
cool name. talks something important will come
today's conversation, something called default mode network.
default mode network collection different brain areas essentially
active not much anything certainly active not
focused one particular task conversation activity. default mode network can
thought less network generates mind wandering
thoughts drifting past present future. Remember, earlier, talked
perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,
present, future two three things, okay? Just like
attentional spotlighting, can place mind, thinking, memory,
cognition onto one things very, present past present
forth. default mode network, involves lot different brain
areas, can thought simply network brain areas active
mind wandering different time domains. paper like share
you, mentioned before, now classic paper, wonderful title,
Wandering Mind Unhappy Mind. Now, sounds almost like news article

Killingsworth Dan Gilbert. published 2010, still considered classic.
paper, Wandering Mind Unhappy Mind, number important
points. going paraphrase certain elements say
essentially like know far better say. first all,
started statement, confess disagree with, is, "Unlike
animals, human beings spend lot time thinking not going around
them: contemplating events happened past, might happen future, will
never happen all." agree assertion human beings that.
certainly experience, although must say, don't think evidence
whatsoever animals don't also. apologies, Killingsworth
Gilbert, happy go toe-to-toe that. not aware data

animals, focus human animal. Now, point still good one,
humans wandering mind call stimulus-
independent thought. is, nothing happening create thoughts
anything happening immediate environment. thoughts just happening
internally. default mode network. study important.
fact, landmark study right time smartphones

whether not tend interoceptively dominant, right, tend pay
attention bodily sensations, exteroceptively dominant. And, again, don't
know answer question, simple test can do. can just sit
lie down, close eyes, can ask assess whether not

well rested are, et cetera, exactly point. sort thing
want every time decide meditation practice. fact, suggest
use determine meditation given moment. say
somebody regular meditator say somebody never

please don't close eyes driving, sort obvious, safe

focus attention primarily internal state whether not attention
perception gets pulled something external, exteroception. And, again, will vary
depending circumstance are. suggest opening eyes
trying focus attention something external seeing evaluating
extent can divorce perception sensations occur level
skin internally. Now, say no technology, least not
aware of, absence fMRI machine, case, inside fMRI machine


this. unless experiment, us aren't, no
technology can tell you, instance, whether not interoceptively

given moment. assess subjectively. However,
sit down, instance, notice can equally split attention
internal sensations external sensations whether not find
pulled external sensations trying focus inward find
pulled inward trying focus outward, well, will dictate sort
meditation perhaps perform moment. Let give example
this. stop way, sit lie down, close eyes,
evaluate whether not can essentially rule eliminate attention
outside events. people won't able entirely, try focus
attention, instance, breathing typical third eye center, know,
focusing spot right behind forehead. feel can reasonably well
exclusion happening around you, well, important question arises.
meditate way enhance interoceptive awareness? rather,
meditate way, instance, eyes open attention
particular portion landscape like tree maybe even, know,

enhance exteroceptive awareness? you, bias one
work default state. Again, default mode network
land interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum. going lead mind
wandering, whereas encourage even say force little bit
anchor attention either inside body outside body, make
decision according less easily, well, actively
training neural circuits. engaging so-called neuroplasticity, brain's
ability change response experience. deliberately engaging shift along

sit wanted meditation, just say three minutes
meditation. good evidence even three minutes meditation can
beneficial variety things, including enhanced focus enhanced anxiety
management. say sit notice can really focus inward
happening level skin internal organs, can rule everything.
Maybe 'cause room quiet maybe just brain state


particularly good moment maybe just natural ability. Well
opt three-minute meditation practice deliberately exterocept,
build circuitry focus something external want,
think people like, adaptive mechanism within

minute example longer, deliberately trying focus

this? Well, know, love use phrase anytime kids, know,
say "This really hard something's challenging," adults will say, "That's really
tough." Well, graduate advisor used say, means learning.

absolutely zero reason neural circuits change. friction,
feeling something hard turns enormous variety mechanisms
level cells, et cetera, allow potentially change neural circuitry.

exteroceptive bias happens given moment. And, again, will change.
you, will change across day early day, very,
good interoceptive-biased meditation, later day, aren't.
actually believe, based data covered, get
papers this, lab actively working well, meditative

Now, think people familiar interoceptive-biased meditation.
Again, setting timer. Maybe don't even set timer, just sit

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people

focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day

couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne

talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice

order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,

don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general

cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous

drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.

exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,

going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern

instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits

focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible

continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin

bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum

Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,

can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another

meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.

terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people
position action-oriented focused, et cetera, come
yoga nidra, certainly useful practice. form meditation, call
meditation-ish, yoga nidra NSDR not typically people think
talk meditation. course, episode meditation. reason
bring yoga nidra NSDR many people meditate enhance sleep
ability reduce total amount sleep need. appears meditation
probably not ideal comparison yoga nidra NSDR, meditation
excellent, not superb, adjusting default mode network toward happiness
mindful present

02:11:33 Choosing Meditative Practice; Hypnosis

placing oneself healthy model interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
covered lot information, like think given key
decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want
thing going allow feel rested tired going allow
adjust state mind not want whatever reason,
anxious exhausted, et cetera." people, say practice like


NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form
meditation. also want just remind everybody app guides meditation, also
information intention setting, Waking app Sam
Harris can immensely beneficial. certainly found beneficial. know millions
people well, encourage check out. talked
determining continuums interoception exteroception
order dictate particular type meditation practice given
moment, whether not focus vision inward eyes closed focus
vision attention outward key component, whether not
cyclic breathing, will allow focus off breathing somewhat
easier non-cyclic breathing, doubling inhales exhales,
whether not breathing going natural not. And, course, need
determine whether not meditation practice designed enhance level
focus relax you. say designed enhance level focus,
doesn't necessarily mean won't relaxing. slow cadence breathing
third eye meditation, relaxing, yet focus refocus
practice, whereas something like yoga nidra NSDR going along
lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing
sleep need. previous podcasts, talked hypnosis, particularly
episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get
hypnosis now, just understand hypnosis distinct breathwork, yoga
nidra, NSDR, meditation even though includes
components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual
attention outward inward go hypnosis, involves breathing
particular kind, involves specific imagery, et cetera. hypnosis distinct
hypnosis really designed fix address specific problem, whereas meditation,
NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically not. can help fix problems
anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, generally not directed toward particular
line thinking. can be, typically not. Whereas hypnosis almost
always, especially clinical context, not stage hypnosis, clinical context
lot research show can, instance, help quitting smoking,
literally quadrupling effectiveness smoking cessation something like
Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
reducing pain number things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis really


great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

selectively stimulated animals, yes, indeed, also done humans,
incredible ability control bodily senses make sense, is,

say appropriately, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex active,
great position interpret going emotionally, interpret bodily
signals comfort discomfort, make really good decisions basis
interpretation. left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex direct
communication directly connected another brain area called anterior
cingulate cortex, ACC. Now, just going refer ACC, okay? ACC
area brain interpreting lot different things bodily signals,
instance, fast breathing, whether not heart beating quickly
slowly, and, importantly, whether not heart beating quickly slowly
circumstance in. instance, running hill
even great shape heart beating fast, unlikely going
concerned heart beating fast appropriate
circumstance. However, just walking along sudden, heart starts
beating quickly no apparent reason, well, going interpret
either pathologic uncomfortable, inappropriate context happen
in. left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex area brain actually
control especially can interpret going ACC region. Now,
probably haven't heard ACC. probably heard brain
area called amygdala. almond-shaped structure two sides brain,
people talk fear center, et cetera. ACC, anterior cingulate


cortex, gets input areas like amygdala, threat detection centers, also
gets input enormous number areas brain body, including
heart, gut, gets information full, is, distended,
empty gut is. gets information quickly breathing input

going body, works closely along one structure.
promise going third structure triad, stop listing

out, know, going inside me? addition that, insula
interpreting information going outside you. insula saying,
instance, hey, steep hill running up, consequence, whatever
heart rate increase experiencing heavy breathing burning lungs,
makes sense. don't worried, don't scared. might want
slow down, makes sense. Whereas, instance, example previously
gave, sitting room everything pretty calm, sudden,
start feeling really uncomfortable, like stomach doesn't feel right start
breathing quickly start so-called anxiety panic attack, large part,
shift bodily sensations doesn't match doesn't correspond
something outside world. incredible triad includes left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate anterior cingulate cortex, insula,
three working together kind conversation, neural conversation,
conversation nonetheless, trying figure out, okay, going inside me?
feel? thinking about? thoughts past
future present. also conversation whether not
sensations experiencing, meaning quick breathing slow
breathing is, heart feels, skin feels, sensations pain,


pleasure matter, whether not makes sense situation
trying determine whether not right things consequence
sensations. Okay, again, can't remember names different
neural structures brain, don't worry it. really not critical.
critical understand conversation constantly occurring
long awake trying figure going inside whether
not makes sense relative going outside around you. Now, humans
smart. is, are, extent, conscious fact memories
past, awareness present, anticipation future. realize,
instance, can seated dinner table, excuse me, thought
something tomorrow, maybe exam stressing us something like
that, will change bodily state way not optimal
moment can still make sense us exam important,
maybe feeling pressure hard conversation have,
maybe excited next day can't eat
excited, can make perfect sense us access
knowledge self can think past, present, future.
makes conversation three structures even interesting dynamic
means can something, eating, talking, running,
number different activities, bodily state may may not match
way adaptive that, yet can completely okay least
understandable us. Now, major emphasis meditation practice make us so-
called mindful. mindfulness? Well, again, isn't one perfect universally
accepted operational definition mindfulness. basically nerd speak saying
people can't agree exactly mindfulness be, is, means everyone.
people assume, think agree, mindfulness includes something
present. say present, doesn't necessarily mean present one's
surroundings course lot meditation practices designed make
us mindful present designed make us mindful present
happening internally ignoring everything happening externally,
designed make us present

00:26:07 Neuroscience Meditation; Perceptual Spotlights



bodily sensations and, particular, breathing thoughts
moment. now explore generic meditation practice looks like,
evaluate tends change activity neural circuits brain
body. there, can split conversation couple different bins,
is, meditation practices ideal enhancing focus, meditation practices
ideal improving mood, meditation practices ideal improving sleep,
meditation practices that, believe not, benefit things one fell swoop.
Okay, happens meditation practice neural level? order
answer question, going scientists. means going
scientists now. going break practice different component
parts address know sure brain activation states occur
different component parts. order that, use somewhat generic
form meditation, generic pretty far-reaching say
people, 75%, say, meditation practice going involve stopping,
meaning getting motion, sitting lying down, and, cases, closing one's
eyes, although absolutely not required close one's eyes meditation.
many forms meditation done eyes open. people, going
involve stopping movement, is, not ambulating, not walking running,
seated lying eyes closed. that, meaning sit lie
close eyes, trivial shift might sound you, actually
profound shift way brain neural circuits body function
following reason. close eyes, shut major avenue
called exteroception. mean exteroception? Well, briefly,
sensing things body body time. also sensing things
outside us time, sights sounds, touch body,
sensations withinside body, et cetera. Now, sensation distinct call
perception. Perception is, put simply, sensations happen paying
attention to. given moment, sensing many, many things.
sound waves hitting ears, pressure receptors bottoms feet
sensing shoes sandals floor, et cetera, not perceiving
place attention them. Now, way perception works
so-called spotlights attention. can't perceive everything once, every sound,
every sight, every touch. overwhelming. fact, terrible.
Rather spotlights perception can either narrow, instance,


focus perception right now big toe right foot
really pour awareness, attention perceiving there,
feels like, tingling pressure, heat cold, et cetera, can broaden
spotlight include feet toes feet legs
whole body entire room. Perception like spotlight, mention
good data can split attention two probably not
two spotlights, can make spotlights perception either broad
diffuse narrow. can practice now like. can pick spot
wall away anywhere, driving, can look location,
can focus intensely one small location, instance, tree horizon
person street number different things outside you, can broaden
spotlight include entire scene once. can also focus spotlight
perception body, say left upper portion chest. course
can focus left upper portion chest something outside you, can
split attention two perceptual spotlights. hard, although not
impossible, three perceptual spotlights, people can split two points
attention perception pretty easily. thing people can pretty
easily merge two spotlights or, rather, just one spotlight attention.
don't always two spotlights attention on, here, using
word attention perception interchangeably. could, instance, two
points attention, talking somebody paying attention whether
not somebody's walking door not, two, completely
focused person talking to, completely focused
stomach ache great sensation hunger belly talking
somebody, fact, not even listening saying all. Okay?
two spotlights perception. can split merge one. And,
important, spotlights perception can intensify dim, there,
using analogy. mean perception happening within
spotlights can very, high acuity. is, can register fine changes
detail like tingling one side big toe right foot versus other, can
somewhat diffuse. just thinking whole toe, which,
case, seems like small area, point can consciously adjust acuity,
is, fineness perception. power
incredible ability brain structure whose name now understand know,


left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, although areas brain
involved well. ability direct attention specific things
environment within body split points attention merge dial
intensity closely paying attention every little shift ripple
change sensation kind dissociate, will, lack better word,

look example happens sit lie close eyes
decide meditate, immediately realize tremendous shift
perceptual ability, why? spotlight attention, can oriented
toward, instance, hear room maybe feeling wind moving


trees environment happen in, close eyes, shut
one major avenues sensory input, vision. that,
tendency perceptual spotlights focused
happens level surface skin inside bodies. informs
us something important, actually two axes two ends
continuum perception. now, talking perception
intention kind thing, indeed are, least sake
conversation, within word perception within word attention,
continuum, continuum one end something called interoception.
Interoception, spelled I, everything sense level skin
inward, sensation inside stomach, sensation heart beating.
people can sense heart beating pretty easily. people challenge
that. feeling surface skin, hot cold feel,
interoception. contrast, end continuum so-called exteroception,
spelled E. Exteroception perception everything outside beyond
confines skin. shutting eyes, particular, meditative practice
direct attention toward so-called third eye center, area right behind
forehead, which, not incidentally, prefrontal cortex, cases
people will focus breathing, movement stomach movement
diaphragm lifting chest extension belly
breathe. that, taking ordinarily perceptual state split
outside world, exteroception, usually also toward inner state.
know, people generally touch feeling skin inward
also paying attention outside them. can think
somebody, instance, restaurant sandwich shop order sandwich
reading menu, exteroception, right? menu outside
confines skin. little ideas maybe big ideas come mind
roast beef sandwich vegetarian sandwich will taste like, will you,
it, like, don't like, et cetera. splitting interoception
exteroception. close eyes, stop, slow down, focus
breathing third eye center, majority perception shifts
interoception. shift end continuum interoception,
something important happens. happens two regions, ACC,
anterior cingulate cortex, insula, really ramp levels neural activity,


make perfect sense areas brain
registering paying attention various sensations full empty
stomach feels, whether not surface skin feels hot cold, on.
just sitting lying closing eyes, brain undergoes
massive shift exteroception interoception. Now, not say can't
distracted external events, and, fact, many people are, early stages
transitioning meditative state involve shift continuum, or,
say, one end continuum no down-up, just
continuum, shift along continuum heightened levels interoception. Now,
mentioned briefly before, many people interoceptively aware just
naturally, even don't meditation practice. people not.
pretty good measure whether not high levels interoceptive awareness
capability, ability count heartbeats without placing fingers
anywhere pressure take pulse. can like, can
actually try estimate number heartbeats simply trying feel heart
beat. people good, meaning accurate this,
people not. seem ability can trained quite bit, and,
fact, meditative practices will improve interoceptive awareness, but,
important point, heightened levels interoceptive awareness, might
sound attractive, oh, really touch body, not always beneficial,
why? many people who, instance, excessive levels anxiety
excessive levels anxiety keenly aware subtle shift
heart rate breathing change sensations within stomach. Whereas
people less aware bodily state, can beneficial, right? can
adaptive not, depending circumstances. probably not adaptive
very, aware internal state if, instance, public speaking,
don't want thinking going stomach quickly
breathing. certainly trying ignore signals, sensations now.
somebody no awareness going on, little interoceptive awareness,
can problematic, too, people can ignore fact
heart attack can ignore fact high blood
pressure carrying life focused everything external no awareness
body. They're, quote, unquote, touch body. want
careful placing valence, sort value good bad


interoceptive awareness versus exteroceptive awareness. importantly, want
emphasize undergo meditation practice, sort stop
movement close eyes, training interoceptive awareness.
becomes important later get discussions meditation reducing
anxiety. people may opt, fact, say people opt
meditative practice involves exteroceptive awareness, actually meditation
like walking meditation even seated meditation bringing focus
place outside body opposed inside body. fact,
examples people meditated quite lot develop heightened
state awareness interoceptive components, is, just fancy, again, nerd

thoughts drifting past present future. Remember, earlier, talked
perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,

attentional spotlighting, can place mind, thinking, memory,
cognition onto one things very, present past present

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment

got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate

breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,

drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend
exhales relative inhales, can even make active exhales. can
inhale [inhales exhales], exhale [inhales exhales]. going shift
nervous system direction calm. And, course, like stay
level alertness aka calmness two sides seesaw
continuum, like right end meditation
started, least terms levels alertness calmness, well,
just keep inhales exhales relatively balanced terms
duration. Now, introduction things like breath holds box breathing Wim Hof
breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail
before. research literature this, please let know. laboratory

fact, associate chair psychiatry, world expert hypnosis,
podcast before, active research program focused issues.
much belief breathwork practice can meditative, meditation
practice can include breathing, meditative practice focuses
breathing itself, interoceptive-biased will be. Now, important
understand interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will specific effect,
make interoceptively aware. think back earlier
episode, many people, will wonderful thing something
actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can
beneficial.



01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice
reducing inflammatory cytokines, even improving outcomes cancer, reducing pain,
improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly
impact heart rate breathing. yanked around every experience.
instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person
environment breaking crying, yes, sad, important
sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, not get pulled
experience much lose ourselves. course areas
brain also leaning on, using metaphor, leaning
insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,
scared also going scared. push-pull
recognition distinct entities also, course, healthy desire
attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going
around you, dropping side continuum dissociated
not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly

traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better

decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer

the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time

cortex, gets input areas like amygdala, threat detection centers, also
gets input enormous number areas brain body, including
heart, gut, gets information full, is, distended,
empty gut is. gets information quickly breathing input
lungs related structures. absolutely critical station making sense
going body, works closely along one structure.
promise going third structure triad, stop listing
off names. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Think sort
interpreter going inside you. ACC, anterior cingulate
cortex, area brain bringing information
going inside body even surface body. know,
pain itch mosquito bite surface body, ACC
definitely register that. absolutely incredible brain structure
called insula, I-N-S-U-L-A, insula, insula bunch different
parts it. insula another area interpreting signals going
brain body, ACC insula working together try figure
out, know, going inside me? addition that, insula
interpreting information going outside you. insula saying,
instance, hey, steep hill running up, consequence, whatever
heart rate increase experiencing heavy breathing burning lungs,
makes sense. don't worried, don't scared. might want
slow down, makes sense. Whereas, instance, example previously
gave, sitting room everything pretty calm, sudden,
start feeling really uncomfortable, like stomach doesn't feel right start
breathing quickly start so-called anxiety panic attack, large part,
shift bodily sensations doesn't match doesn't correspond
something outside world. incredible triad includes left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate anterior cingulate cortex, insula,
three working together kind conversation, neural conversation,
conversation nonetheless, trying figure out, okay, going inside me?
feel? thinking about? thoughts past
future present. also conversation whether not
sensations experiencing, meaning quick breathing slow
breathing is, heart feels, skin feels, sensations pain,


pleasure matter, whether not makes sense situation
trying determine whether not right things consequence
sensations. Okay, again, can't remember names different
neural structures brain, don't worry it. really not critical.
critical understand conversation constantly occurring
long awake trying figure going inside whether
not makes sense relative going outside around you. Now, humans
smart. is, are, extent, conscious fact memories
past, awareness present, anticipation future. realize,
instance, can seated dinner table, excuse me, thought
something tomorrow, maybe exam stressing us something like
that, will change bodily state way not optimal
moment can still make sense us exam important,
maybe feeling pressure hard conversation have,
maybe excited next day can't eat
excited, can make perfect sense us access
knowledge self can think past, present, future.
makes conversation three structures even interesting dynamic
means can something, eating, talking, running,
number different activities, bodily state may may not match
way adaptive that, yet can completely okay least
understandable us. Now, major emphasis meditation practice make us so-
called mindful. mindfulness? Well, again, isn't one perfect universally
accepted operational definition mindfulness. basically nerd speak saying
people can't agree exactly mindfulness be, is, means everyone.
people assume, think agree, mindfulness includes something
present. say present, doesn't necessarily mean present one's
surroundings course lot meditation practices designed make
us mindful present designed make us mindful present
happening internally ignoring everything happening externally,
designed make us present

00:26:07 Neuroscience Meditation; Perceptual Spotlights



bodily sensations and, particular, breathing thoughts
moment. now explore generic meditation practice looks like,
evaluate tends change activity neural circuits brain
body. there, can split conversation couple different bins,
is, meditation practices ideal enhancing focus, meditation practices
ideal improving mood, meditation practices ideal improving sleep,
meditation practices that, believe not, benefit things one fell swoop.
Okay, happens meditation practice neural level? order
answer question, going scientists. means going
scientists now. going break practice different component
parts address know sure brain activation states occur
different component parts. order that, use somewhat generic
form meditation, generic pretty far-reaching say
people, 75%, say, meditation practice going involve stopping,
meaning getting motion, sitting lying down, and, cases, closing one's
eyes, although absolutely not required close one's eyes meditation.
many forms meditation done eyes open. people, going
involve stopping movement, is, not ambulating, not walking running,
seated lying eyes closed. that, meaning sit lie
close eyes, trivial shift might sound you, actually
profound shift way brain neural circuits body function
following reason. close eyes, shut major avenue
called exteroception. mean exteroception? Well, briefly,
sensing things body body time. also sensing things
outside us time, sights sounds, touch body,
sensations withinside body, et cetera. Now, sensation distinct call
perception. Perception is, put simply, sensations happen paying
attention to. given moment, sensing many, many things.
sound waves hitting ears, pressure receptors bottoms feet
sensing shoes sandals floor, et cetera, not perceiving
place attention them. Now, way perception works
so-called spotlights attention. can't perceive everything once, every sound,
every sight, every touch. overwhelming. fact, terrible.
Rather spotlights perception can either narrow, instance,


focus perception right now big toe right foot
really pour awareness, attention perceiving there,
feels like, tingling pressure, heat cold, et cetera, can broaden
spotlight include feet toes feet legs
whole body entire room. Perception like spotlight, mention
good data can split attention two probably not
two spotlights, can make spotlights perception either broad
diffuse narrow. can practice now like. can pick spot
wall away anywhere, driving, can look location,
can focus intensely one small location, instance, tree horizon
person street number different things outside you, can broaden
spotlight include entire scene once. can also focus spotlight
perception body, say left upper portion chest. course
can focus left upper portion chest something outside you, can
split attention two perceptual spotlights. hard, although not
impossible, three perceptual spotlights, people can split two points
attention perception pretty easily. thing people can pretty
easily merge two spotlights or, rather, just one spotlight attention.
don't always two spotlights attention on, here, using
word attention perception interchangeably. could, instance, two
points attention, talking somebody paying attention whether
not somebody's walking door not, two, completely
focused person talking to, completely focused
stomach ache great sensation hunger belly talking
somebody, fact, not even listening saying all. Okay?
two spotlights perception. can split merge one. And,
important, spotlights perception can intensify dim, there,
using analogy. mean perception happening within
spotlights can very, high acuity. is, can register fine changes
detail like tingling one side big toe right foot versus other, can
somewhat diffuse. just thinking whole toe, which,
case, seems like small area, point can consciously adjust acuity,
is, fineness perception. power
incredible ability brain structure whose name now understand know,


left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, although areas brain
involved well. ability direct attention specific things
environment within body split points attention merge dial
intensity closely paying attention every little shift ripple
change sensation kind dissociate, will, lack better word,
disengage perception, control ability

look example happens sit lie close eyes
decide meditate, immediately realize tremendous shift
perceptual ability, why? spotlight attention, can oriented
toward, instance, hear room maybe feeling wind moving


trees environment happen in, close eyes, shut
one major avenues sensory input, vision. that,
tendency perceptual spotlights focused
happens level surface skin inside bodies. informs
us something important, actually two axes two ends
continuum perception. now, talking perception
intention kind thing, indeed are, least sake
conversation, within word perception within word attention,
continuum, continuum one end something called interoception.
Interoception, spelled I, everything sense level skin
inward, sensation inside stomach, sensation heart beating.
people can sense heart beating pretty easily. people challenge
that. feeling surface skin, hot cold feel,
interoception. contrast, end continuum so-called exteroception,
spelled E. Exteroception perception everything outside beyond
confines skin. shutting eyes, particular, meditative practice
direct attention toward so-called third eye center, area right behind
forehead, which, not incidentally, prefrontal cortex, cases
people will focus breathing, movement stomach movement
diaphragm lifting chest extension belly
breathe. that, taking ordinarily perceptual state split
outside world, exteroception, usually also toward inner state.
know, people generally touch feeling skin inward
also paying attention outside them. can think
somebody, instance, restaurant sandwich shop order sandwich
reading menu, exteroception, right? menu outside
confines skin. little ideas maybe big ideas come mind
roast beef sandwich vegetarian sandwich will taste like, will you,
it, like, don't like, et cetera. splitting interoception
exteroception. close eyes, stop, slow down, focus
breathing third eye center, majority perception shifts
interoception. shift end continuum interoception,
something important happens. happens two regions, ACC,
anterior cingulate cortex, insula, really ramp levels neural activity,


make perfect sense areas brain
registering paying attention various sensations full empty
stomach feels, whether not surface skin feels hot cold, on.
just sitting lying closing eyes, brain undergoes
massive shift exteroception interoception. Now, not say can't
distracted external events, and, fact, many people are, early stages
transitioning meditative state involve shift continuum, or,
say, one end continuum no down-up, just
continuum, shift along continuum heightened levels interoception. Now,
mentioned briefly before, many people interoceptively aware just
naturally, even don't meditation practice. people not.
pretty good measure whether not high levels interoceptive awareness
capability, ability count heartbeats without placing fingers
anywhere pressure take pulse. can like, can
actually try estimate number heartbeats simply trying feel heart
beat. people good, meaning accurate this,
people not. seem ability can trained quite bit, and,
fact, meditative practices will improve interoceptive awareness, but,
important point, heightened levels interoceptive awareness, might
sound attractive, oh, really touch body, not always beneficial,
why? many people who, instance, excessive levels anxiety
excessive levels anxiety keenly aware subtle shift
heart rate breathing change sensations within stomach. Whereas
people less aware bodily state, can beneficial, right? can
adaptive not, depending circumstances. probably not adaptive
very, aware internal state if, instance, public speaking,
don't want thinking going stomach quickly
breathing. certainly trying ignore signals, sensations now.
somebody no awareness going on, little interoceptive awareness,
can problematic, too, people can ignore fact
heart attack can ignore fact high blood
pressure carrying life focused everything external no awareness
body. They're, quote, unquote, touch body. want
careful placing valence, sort value good bad


interoceptive awareness versus exteroceptive awareness. importantly, want
emphasize undergo meditation practice, sort stop
movement close eyes, training interoceptive awareness.
becomes important later get discussions meditation reducing
anxiety. people may opt, fact, say people opt
meditative practice involves exteroceptive awareness, actually meditation
like walking meditation even seated meditation bringing focus
place outside body opposed inside body. fact,
examples people meditated quite lot develop heightened
state awareness interoceptive components, is, just fancy, again, nerd
speak aware breathing heart state gut
actually intrusive daily activities. will ask ask question
now. somebody tends touch bodily sensations, so,
instance, skin inwards? somebody tends less touch
aware interoceptive state? no right wrong answer. don't
get F D C depending answer. just good question
every one us answer, think people will answer depends.
depends whether not social setting whether not alone.
going return answer keep mind will become
beneficial building optimal meditation practice you. now, just note,
continuum perception, interoception exteroception. Closing eyes
increases interoception. Opening eyes dramatically increases exteroception just
automatically, just automatically much brain, fact, 40% more,
dedicated vision. this, say, low vision no
vision blind poor vision, entire process
translated auditory, sound domain, true people can see
true people can't see. course, people can't see, closing eyes
doesn't huge shift towards interoception, studies,
not many would've liked find, studies of, instance, people
blind low vision, don't see well, close ears
can't hear external world put headphones noise-canceling headphones,

00:42:20 Default Mode Network, Continuum Interoception & Exteroception



world inside becomes prominent relative world outside
obvious reasons. asked ask whether not
somebody tends interoceptively aware not, exteroceptively
aware not. might not able answer question,
can't, chances effectively sliding along continuum depending
activities doing. probably kind person somebody
comes starts talking you, will engage conversation,
don't feel inside body thinking heart beating
whether not flushing red, et cetera, going pay attention
say. Many people, however, somebody talks them, social anxiety
even slight bit social anxiety, will thinking whether not cheeks
flushing whether not look right sound right whether not
something teeth. normal responses, really speak issue
whether not tend shift towards interoceptive awareness
exteroceptive awareness. And, course, context dependent. will depend
whether not you're, know, date somebody that, know,
loathe find later food teeth whether not
somebody familiar not really matter much
person tell kind thing. mean one location
another location along continuum interoception exteroception? Well, know
means neurally, right? know interoceptively aware,
insula ACC active, not useful. not helpful tool.
just fact. Now, actually studies meditation practice can
terms moving along continuum naturally sit order help
function not just meditation times. order illustrate this,
want start description now classic study. cool study,
cool name. talks something important will come
today's conversation, something called default mode network.
default mode network collection different brain areas essentially
active not much anything certainly active not
focused one particular task conversation activity. default mode network can
thought less network generates mind wandering
thoughts drifting past present future. Remember, earlier, talked
perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,
present, future two three things, okay? Just like
attentional spotlighting, can place mind, thinking, memory,
cognition onto one things very, present past present
forth. default mode network, involves lot different brain
areas, can thought simply network brain areas active
mind wandering different time domains. paper like share
you, mentioned before, now classic paper, wonderful title,
Wandering Mind Unhappy Mind. Now, sounds almost like news article
news article scientific paper, actually title scientific paper
published journal, "Science," one three apex journals.
know, scientific publishing competitive, especially competitive get
manuscripts accepted "Science," "Nature," journal "Cell,"
represents kind Super Bowl, NBA Championships, Stanley Cup, will,
sports aficionados scientific publishing. paper Matthew
Killingsworth Dan Gilbert. published 2010, still considered classic.
paper, Wandering Mind Unhappy Mind, number important
points. going paraphrase certain elements say
essentially like know far better say. first all,
started statement, confess disagree with, is, "Unlike
animals, human beings spend lot time thinking not going around
them: contemplating events happened past, might happen future, will
never happen all." agree assertion human beings that.
certainly experience, although must say, don't think evidence
whatsoever animals don't also. apologies, Killingsworth
Gilbert, happy go toe-to-toe that. not aware data
prove one way animals thinking. set aside


animals, focus human animal. Now, point still good one,
humans wandering mind call stimulus-
independent thought. is, nothing happening create thoughts
anything happening immediate environment. thoughts just happening
internally. default mode network. study important.
fact, landmark study right time smartphones
became widely available use, again, 2010. basically pinged people,
contacted people iPhones many times per day, well
2,200 adults. mix male female people study. mean
age 34 years, range, mean, course, average,

important points came data, and, again, large data set,
that, again, paraphrasing, first, people's minds wandered frequently

whether not tend interoceptively dominant, right, tend pay
attention bodily sensations, exteroceptively dominant. And, again, don't
know answer question, simple test can do. can just sit
lie down, close eyes, can ask assess whether not

people room, whether not tend able focus internal

well rested are, et cetera, exactly point. sort thing
want every time decide meditation practice. fact, suggest
use determine meditation given moment. say
somebody regular meditator say somebody never
meditated like develop meditation practice. suggest test
whether not interoceptively dominant exteroceptively dominant

moment. say plane car. car,
please don't close eyes driving, sort obvious, safe
way, please. stop, close eyes, assess whether not can access
focus attention primarily internal state whether not attention
perception gets pulled something external, exteroception. And, again, will vary
depending circumstance are. suggest opening eyes
trying focus attention something external seeing evaluating
extent can divorce perception sensations occur level
skin internally. Now, say no technology, least not
aware of, absence fMRI machine, case, inside fMRI machine


this. unless experiment, us aren't, no
technology can tell you, instance, whether not interoceptively

given moment. assess subjectively. However,
sit down, instance, notice can equally split attention
internal sensations external sensations whether not find
pulled external sensations trying focus inward find
pulled inward trying focus outward, well, will dictate sort
meditation perhaps perform moment. Let give example
this. stop way, sit lie down, close eyes,
evaluate whether not can essentially rule eliminate attention
outside events. people won't able entirely, try focus
attention, instance, breathing typical third eye center, know,
focusing spot right behind forehead. feel can reasonably well
exclusion happening around you, well, important question arises.
meditate way enhance interoceptive awareness? rather,
meditate way, instance, eyes open attention

anchor attention either inside body outside body, make
decision according less easily, well, actively

sit wanted meditation, just say three minutes

Maybe 'cause room quiet maybe just brain state

say "This really hard something's challenging," adults will say, "That's really

01:01:48 State & Trait Changes, Interoceptive & Exteroceptive Meditations, Refocusing

actively try suppress bias toward interoceptive
exteroceptive. Now, think immensely beneficial, immediate changes
experience, others called state change, is,
also can lead to, referred earlier, neuroplasticity, changes
brain circuits underlie default mode network lead called
trait changes. want clear not first make state versus
trait distinction. distinction raised really wonderful book. fact,
can't recommend book highly enough. book "Altered Traits: Science Reveals
Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body." book Daniel
Goleman Richard Davidson who've done terrific work many writings many
TED Talks, et cetera, meditation. say circa 2016, 2017, book
really captured believe essential elements science
meditation lot history well. Today, focusing much
covered book also lot things happened, excuse me, since 2017.
fact, papers going talk papers published
2017. But, again, wonderful book clearly distinguish
state changes trait changes, trait changes long-lasting
ones. read book literature follows is, again, sit
meditate, going effective interoceptive, exteroceptive
bias assessment. Ask whether not head outside
head, will, meditation practice runs counter

focused going around you, pushes internally.
Now, think people familiar interoceptive-biased meditation.
Again, setting timer. Maybe don't even set timer, just sit
lie down, close eyes, focus third eye center behind forehead
focus breathing bodily sensations. typical often discussed.


Exteroceptive based meditations, pick focal point outside beyond confines

"Ugh, like, can't focus anything." Pretty soon, notice refocusing

something borne neuroimaging data. lot people think can

number times refocus, better training getting.
earlier, mentioned interoceptive-biased exteroceptive-biased meditation
three minutes. say three minutes? Well, three minutes seems like
reasonable number people consistently, know, day.
fact, studies one-minute meditations three-minute meditations
10 60. laboratory studying 5-minute-a-day meditation,
clearly benefits, think also clear three minutes, many benefits
starting arrive. not pointing one particular data point here,
clear forcing oneself direct one's perception, is, attention,

One particular using actually started using dad
big fan now fairly long meditations. 10 20
minutes least every day often every day, convinced check
Waking app Sam Harris put out. looked it, think sits
behind paywall, can access much least trial try without
get behind paywall. not sponsor podcast,
mention, decided use Waking app. think terrific, think one
reasons terrific Sam includes short descriptions meditation
specific meditation can just prior meditation.
meditations can quite brief. minute long, two minutes long,
longer even quite bit longer. app, think, includes variety
meditations really encompasses huge range possibilities possible
meditation, that, least experience Waking app, led
consistent meditation practice. And, course, love get Sam
podcast guest talk sort underpinnings Waking
app views everything meditation to, know big discussion
free will consciousness, deep somewhat abstract
discussions. really hope get Sam podcast time not far now.
Meanwhile, never met person, absolutely love Waking app, Sam,
know father well, know many already use it.

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate

different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic

hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release

breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered

breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught

sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is

gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible

continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin

bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum

Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,

mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.

not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural

asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?

answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect

times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much

decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want
thing going allow feel rested tired going allow

anxious exhausted, et cetera." people, say practice like


NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form

sleep need. previous podcasts, talked hypnosis, particularly
episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

pleasure matter, whether not makes sense situation
trying determine whether not right things consequence
sensations. Okay, again, can't remember names different
neural structures brain, don't worry it. really not critical.
critical understand conversation constantly occurring
long awake trying figure going inside whether
not makes sense relative going outside around you. Now, humans
smart. is, are, extent, conscious fact memories
past, awareness present, anticipation future. realize,
instance, can seated dinner table, excuse me, thought
something tomorrow, maybe exam stressing us something like
that, will change bodily state way not optimal
moment can still make sense us exam important,
maybe feeling pressure hard conversation have,
maybe excited next day can't eat
excited, can make perfect sense us access
knowledge self can think past, present, future.
makes conversation three structures even interesting dynamic
means can something, eating, talking, running,
number different activities, bodily state may may not match
way adaptive that, yet can completely okay least
understandable us. Now, major emphasis meditation practice make us so-
called mindful. mindfulness? Well, again, isn't one perfect universally
accepted operational definition mindfulness. basically nerd speak saying
people can't agree exactly mindfulness be, is, means everyone.
people assume, think agree, mindfulness includes something
present. say present, doesn't necessarily mean present one's
surroundings course lot meditation practices designed make
us mindful present designed make us mindful present
happening internally ignoring everything happening externally,
designed make us present

moment. now explore generic meditation practice looks like,
evaluate tends change activity neural circuits brain
body. there, can split conversation couple different bins,
is, meditation practices ideal enhancing focus, meditation practices
ideal improving mood, meditation practices ideal improving sleep,
meditation practices that, believe not, benefit things one fell swoop.
Okay, happens meditation practice neural level? order
answer question, going scientists. means going
scientists now. going break practice different component
parts address know sure brain activation states occur
different component parts. order that, use somewhat generic
form meditation, generic pretty far-reaching say
people, 75%, say, meditation practice going involve stopping,
meaning getting motion, sitting lying down, and, cases, closing one's
eyes, although absolutely not required close one's eyes meditation.
many forms meditation done eyes open. people, going
involve stopping movement, is, not ambulating, not walking running,
seated lying eyes closed. that, meaning sit lie
close eyes, trivial shift might sound you, actually
profound shift way brain neural circuits body function
following reason. close eyes, shut major avenue
called exteroception. mean exteroception? Well, briefly,
sensing things body body time. also sensing things
outside us time, sights sounds, touch body,
sensations withinside body, et cetera. Now, sensation distinct call
perception. Perception is, put simply, sensations happen paying
attention to. given moment, sensing many, many things.
sound waves hitting ears, pressure receptors bottoms feet
sensing shoes sandals floor, et cetera, not perceiving
place attention them. Now, way perception works
so-called spotlights attention. can't perceive everything once, every sound,
every sight, every touch. overwhelming. fact, terrible.
Rather spotlights perception can either narrow, instance,


focus perception right now big toe right foot
really pour awareness, attention perceiving there,
feels like, tingling pressure, heat cold, et cetera, can broaden
spotlight include feet toes feet legs
whole body entire room. Perception like spotlight, mention
good data can split attention two probably not
two spotlights, can make spotlights perception either broad
diffuse narrow. can practice now like. can pick spot
wall away anywhere, driving, can look location,
can focus intensely one small location, instance, tree horizon
person street number different things outside you, can broaden
spotlight include entire scene once. can also focus spotlight
perception body, say left upper portion chest. course
can focus left upper portion chest something outside you, can
split attention two perceptual spotlights. hard, although not
impossible, three perceptual spotlights, people can split two points
attention perception pretty easily. thing people can pretty
easily merge two spotlights or, rather, just one spotlight attention.
don't always two spotlights attention on, here, using
word attention perception interchangeably. could, instance, two
points attention, talking somebody paying attention whether
not somebody's walking door not, two, completely
focused person talking to, completely focused
stomach ache great sensation hunger belly talking
somebody, fact, not even listening saying all. Okay?
two spotlights perception. can split merge one. And,
important, spotlights perception can intensify dim, there,
using analogy. mean perception happening within
spotlights can very, high acuity. is, can register fine changes
detail like tingling one side big toe right foot versus other, can
somewhat diffuse. just thinking whole toe, which,
case, seems like small area, point can consciously adjust acuity,
is, fineness perception. power

look example happens sit lie close eyes

perceptual ability, why? spotlight attention, can oriented
toward, instance, hear room maybe feeling wind moving


trees environment happen in, close eyes, shut
one major avenues sensory input, vision. that,
tendency perceptual spotlights focused
happens level surface skin inside bodies. informs
us something important, actually two axes two ends
continuum perception. now, talking perception
intention kind thing, indeed are, least sake
conversation, within word perception within word attention,
continuum, continuum one end something called interoception.
Interoception, spelled I, everything sense level skin
inward, sensation inside stomach, sensation heart beating.
people can sense heart beating pretty easily. people challenge
that. feeling surface skin, hot cold feel,
interoception. contrast, end continuum so-called exteroception,
spelled E. Exteroception perception everything outside beyond
confines skin. shutting eyes, particular, meditative practice
direct attention toward so-called third eye center, area right behind
forehead, which, not incidentally, prefrontal cortex, cases
people will focus breathing, movement stomach movement
diaphragm lifting chest extension belly
breathe. that, taking ordinarily perceptual state split
outside world, exteroception, usually also toward inner state.
know, people generally touch feeling skin inward
also paying attention outside them. can think
somebody, instance, restaurant sandwich shop order sandwich
reading menu, exteroception, right? menu outside
confines skin. little ideas maybe big ideas come mind
roast beef sandwich vegetarian sandwich will taste like, will you,
it, like, don't like, et cetera. splitting interoception
exteroception. close eyes, stop, slow down, focus
breathing third eye center, majority perception shifts
interoception. shift end continuum interoception,
something important happens. happens two regions, ACC,
anterior cingulate cortex, insula, really ramp levels neural activity,


make perfect sense areas brain
registering paying attention various sensations full empty
stomach feels, whether not surface skin feels hot cold, on.
just sitting lying closing eyes, brain undergoes
massive shift exteroception interoception. Now, not say can't
distracted external events, and, fact, many people are, early stages
transitioning meditative state involve shift continuum, or,
say, one end continuum no down-up, just
continuum, shift along continuum heightened levels interoception. Now,
mentioned briefly before, many people interoceptively aware just
naturally, even don't meditation practice. people not.
pretty good measure whether not high levels interoceptive awareness
capability, ability count heartbeats without placing fingers
anywhere pressure take pulse. can like, can
actually try estimate number heartbeats simply trying feel heart
beat. people good, meaning accurate this,
people not. seem ability can trained quite bit, and,
fact, meditative practices will improve interoceptive awareness, but,
important point, heightened levels interoceptive awareness, might
sound attractive, oh, really touch body, not always beneficial,
why? many people who, instance, excessive levels anxiety
excessive levels anxiety keenly aware subtle shift
heart rate breathing change sensations within stomach. Whereas
people less aware bodily state, can beneficial, right? can
adaptive not, depending circumstances. probably not adaptive
very, aware internal state if, instance, public speaking,
don't want thinking going stomach quickly
breathing. certainly trying ignore signals, sensations now.
somebody no awareness going on, little interoceptive awareness,
can problematic, too, people can ignore fact
heart attack can ignore fact high blood
pressure carrying life focused everything external no awareness
body. They're, quote, unquote, touch body. want
careful placing valence, sort value good bad


interoceptive awareness versus exteroceptive awareness. importantly, want
emphasize undergo meditation practice, sort stop
movement close eyes, training interoceptive awareness.
becomes important later get discussions meditation reducing
anxiety. people may opt, fact, say people opt
meditative practice involves exteroceptive awareness, actually meditation
like walking meditation even seated meditation bringing focus
place outside body opposed inside body. fact,
examples people meditated quite lot develop heightened
state awareness interoceptive components, is, just fancy, again, nerd
speak aware breathing heart state gut
actually intrusive daily activities. will ask ask question
now. somebody tends touch bodily sensations, so,
instance, skin inwards? somebody tends less touch
aware interoceptive state? no right wrong answer. don't
get F D C depending answer. just good question
every one us answer, think people will answer depends.
depends whether not social setting whether not alone.
going return answer keep mind will become
beneficial building optimal meditation practice you. now, just note,
continuum perception, interoception exteroception. Closing eyes
increases interoception. Opening eyes dramatically increases exteroception just
automatically, just automatically much brain, fact, 40% more,
dedicated vision. this, say, low vision no
vision blind poor vision, entire process
translated auditory, sound domain, true people can see
true people can't see. course, people can't see, closing eyes
doesn't huge shift towards interoception, studies,
not many would've liked find, studies of, instance, people
blind low vision, don't see well, close ears
can't hear external world put headphones noise-canceling headphones,

00:42:20 Default Mode Network, Continuum Interoception & Exteroception



world inside becomes prominent relative world outside
obvious reasons. asked ask whether not
somebody tends interoceptively aware not, exteroceptively
aware not. might not able answer question,
can't, chances effectively sliding along continuum depending
activities doing. probably kind person somebody
comes starts talking you, will engage conversation,
don't feel inside body thinking heart beating
whether not flushing red, et cetera, going pay attention
say. Many people, however, somebody talks them, social anxiety
even slight bit social anxiety, will thinking whether not cheeks
flushing whether not look right sound right whether not
something teeth. normal responses, really speak issue
whether not tend shift towards interoceptive awareness
exteroceptive awareness. And, course, context dependent. will depend
whether not you're, know, date somebody that, know,
loathe find later food teeth whether not
somebody familiar not really matter much
person tell kind thing. mean one location
another location along continuum interoception exteroception? Well, know
means neurally, right? know interoceptively aware,
insula ACC active, not useful. not helpful tool.
just fact. Now, actually studies meditation practice can
terms moving along continuum naturally sit order help
function not just meditation times. order illustrate this,
want start description now classic study. cool study,
cool name. talks something important will come
today's conversation, something called default mode network.
default mode network collection different brain areas essentially
active not much anything certainly active not
focused one particular task conversation activity. default mode network can
thought less network generates mind wandering
thoughts drifting past present future. Remember, earlier, talked
perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,
present, future two three things, okay? Just like
attentional spotlighting, can place mind, thinking, memory,
cognition onto one things very, present past present
forth. default mode network, involves lot different brain
areas, can thought simply network brain areas active
mind wandering different time domains. paper like share
you, mentioned before, now classic paper, wonderful title,
Wandering Mind Unhappy Mind. Now, sounds almost like news article
news article scientific paper, actually title scientific paper
published journal, "Science," one three apex journals.
know, scientific publishing competitive, especially competitive get

represents kind Super Bowl, NBA Championships, Stanley Cup, will,
sports aficionados scientific publishing. paper Matthew
Killingsworth Dan Gilbert. published 2010, still considered classic.
paper, Wandering Mind Unhappy Mind, number important
points. going paraphrase certain elements say
essentially like know far better say. first all,
started statement, confess disagree with, is, "Unlike
animals, human beings spend lot time thinking not going around
them: contemplating events happened past, might happen future, will
never happen all." agree assertion human beings that.
certainly experience, although must say, don't think evidence
whatsoever animals don't also. apologies, Killingsworth
Gilbert, happy go toe-to-toe that. not aware data
prove one way animals thinking. set aside


animals, focus human animal. Now, point still good one,
humans wandering mind call stimulus-
independent thought. is, nothing happening create thoughts
anything happening immediate environment. thoughts just happening
internally. default mode network. study important.
fact, landmark study right time smartphones
became widely available use, again, 2010. basically pinged people,
contacted people iPhones many times per day, well
2,200 adults. mix male female people study. mean

whether not tend interoceptively dominant, right, tend pay
attention bodily sensations, exteroceptively dominant. And, again, don't
know answer question, simple test can do. can just sit
lie down, close eyes, can ask assess whether not

want every time decide meditation practice. fact, suggest
use determine meditation given moment. say
somebody regular meditator say somebody never
meditated like develop meditation practice. suggest test
whether not interoceptively dominant exteroceptively dominant

please don't close eyes driving, sort obvious, safe
way, please. stop, close eyes, assess whether not can access
focus attention primarily internal state whether not attention
perception gets pulled something external, exteroception. And, again, will vary
depending circumstance are. suggest opening eyes
trying focus attention something external seeing evaluating
extent can divorce perception sensations occur level
skin internally. Now, say no technology, least not

this. unless experiment, us aren't, no
technology can tell you, instance, whether not interoceptively

given moment. assess subjectively. However,
sit down, instance, notice can equally split attention
internal sensations external sensations whether not find
pulled external sensations trying focus inward find
pulled inward trying focus outward, well, will dictate sort
meditation perhaps perform moment. Let give example
this. stop way, sit lie down, close eyes,
evaluate whether not can essentially rule eliminate attention
outside events. people won't able entirely, try focus
attention, instance, breathing typical third eye center, know,
focusing spot right behind forehead. feel can reasonably well
exclusion happening around you, well, important question arises.

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people

Whereas exteroceptively focused given moment, well,

these, practices covered podcast
guests, instance, highlighted 13-minute meditation Dr. Wendy Suzuki
New York University's laboratory popularized, popularized
wonderful paper will provide link shows daily 13-minute
meditation, traditional third eye, interoceptively biased, focus
breathing, focus location directly behind one's forehead both,

weeks, greatly improved mood, improved ability sleep, improved cognitive ability


focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day

couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne

talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,

don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice

cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous

drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales

exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],

going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught

sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is

gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice

improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling

traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,

dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading

process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within

conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum

involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going
around you, dropping side continuum dissociated
not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people
position action-oriented focused, et cetera, come
yoga nidra, certainly useful practice. form meditation, call
meditation-ish, yoga nidra NSDR not typically people think
talk meditation. course, episode meditation. reason
bring yoga nidra NSDR many people meditate enhance sleep
ability reduce total amount sleep need. appears meditation
probably not ideal comparison yoga nidra NSDR, meditation
excellent, not superb, adjusting default mode network toward happiness
mindful present

02:11:33 Choosing Meditative Practice; Hypnosis

placing oneself healthy model interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
covered lot information, like think given key
decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want
thing going allow feel rested tired going allow
adjust state mind not want whatever reason,
anxious exhausted, et cetera." people, say practice like


NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form
meditation. also want just remind everybody app guides meditation, also
information intention setting, Waking app Sam
Harris can immensely beneficial. certainly found beneficial. know millions
people well, encourage check out. talked
determining continuums interoception exteroception
order dictate particular type meditation practice given
moment, whether not focus vision inward eyes closed focus
vision attention outward key component, whether not
cyclic breathing, will allow focus off breathing somewhat
easier non-cyclic breathing, doubling inhales exhales,
whether not breathing going natural not. And, course, need
determine whether not meditation practice designed enhance level
focus relax you. say designed enhance level focus,
doesn't necessarily mean won't relaxing. slow cadence breathing
third eye meditation, relaxing, yet focus refocus
practice, whereas something like yoga nidra NSDR going along
lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing
sleep need. previous podcasts, talked hypnosis, particularly
episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get
hypnosis now, just understand hypnosis distinct breathwork, yoga
nidra, NSDR, meditation even though includes
components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual
attention outward inward go hypnosis, involves breathing
particular kind, involves specific imagery, et cetera. hypnosis distinct
hypnosis really designed fix address specific problem, whereas meditation,
NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically not. can help fix problems
anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, generally not directed toward particular
line thinking. can be, typically not. Whereas hypnosis almost
always, especially clinical context, not stage hypnosis, clinical context
lot research show can, instance, help quitting smoking,
literally quadrupling effectiveness smoking cessation something like
Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
reducing pain number things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis really


great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

bodily sensations and, particular, breathing thoughts
moment. now explore generic meditation practice looks like,
evaluate tends change activity neural circuits brain
body. there, can split conversation couple different bins,
is, meditation practices ideal enhancing focus, meditation practices
ideal improving mood, meditation practices ideal improving sleep,
meditation practices that, believe not, benefit things one fell swoop.
Okay, happens meditation practice neural level? order
answer question, going scientists. means going
scientists now. going break practice different component
parts address know sure brain activation states occur
different component parts. order that, use somewhat generic
form meditation, generic pretty far-reaching say
people, 75%, say, meditation practice going involve stopping,
meaning getting motion, sitting lying down, and, cases, closing one's
eyes, although absolutely not required close one's eyes meditation.
many forms meditation done eyes open. people, going
involve stopping movement, is, not ambulating, not walking running,
seated lying eyes closed. that, meaning sit lie
close eyes, trivial shift might sound you, actually
profound shift way brain neural circuits body function
following reason. close eyes, shut major avenue
called exteroception. mean exteroception? Well, briefly,
sensing things body body time. also sensing things
outside us time, sights sounds, touch body,
sensations withinside body, et cetera. Now, sensation distinct call
perception. Perception is, put simply, sensations happen paying
attention to. given moment, sensing many, many things.
sound waves hitting ears, pressure receptors bottoms feet
sensing shoes sandals floor, et cetera, not perceiving
place attention them. Now, way perception works
so-called spotlights attention. can't perceive everything once, every sound,
every sight, every touch. overwhelming. fact, terrible.
Rather spotlights perception can either narrow, instance,


focus perception right now big toe right foot
really pour awareness, attention perceiving there,
feels like, tingling pressure, heat cold, et cetera, can broaden
spotlight include feet toes feet legs
whole body entire room. Perception like spotlight, mention
good data can split attention two probably not
two spotlights, can make spotlights perception either broad
diffuse narrow. can practice now like. can pick spot
wall away anywhere, driving, can look location,
can focus intensely one small location, instance, tree horizon
person street number different things outside you, can broaden
spotlight include entire scene once. can also focus spotlight
perception body, say left upper portion chest. course
can focus left upper portion chest something outside you, can
split attention two perceptual spotlights. hard, although not
impossible, three perceptual spotlights, people can split two points
attention perception pretty easily. thing people can pretty
easily merge two spotlights or, rather, just one spotlight attention.
don't always two spotlights attention on, here, using
word attention perception interchangeably. could, instance, two
points attention, talking somebody paying attention whether
not somebody's walking door not, two, completely
focused person talking to, completely focused
stomach ache great sensation hunger belly talking
somebody, fact, not even listening saying all. Okay?
two spotlights perception. can split merge one. And,
important, spotlights perception can intensify dim, there,
using analogy. mean perception happening within
spotlights can very, high acuity. is, can register fine changes
detail like tingling one side big toe right foot versus other, can
somewhat diffuse. just thinking whole toe, which,
case, seems like small area, point can consciously adjust acuity,
is, fineness perception. power
incredible ability brain structure whose name now understand know,

look example happens sit lie close eyes
decide meditate, immediately realize tremendous shift
perceptual ability, why? spotlight attention, can oriented
toward, instance, hear room maybe feeling wind moving


trees environment happen in, close eyes, shut
one major avenues sensory input, vision. that,
tendency perceptual spotlights focused
happens level surface skin inside bodies. informs
us something important, actually two axes two ends
continuum perception. now, talking perception
intention kind thing, indeed are, least sake
conversation, within word perception within word attention,
continuum, continuum one end something called interoception.
Interoception, spelled I, everything sense level skin
inward, sensation inside stomach, sensation heart beating.
people can sense heart beating pretty easily. people challenge
that. feeling surface skin, hot cold feel,
interoception. contrast, end continuum so-called exteroception,
spelled E. Exteroception perception everything outside beyond
confines skin. shutting eyes, particular, meditative practice
direct attention toward so-called third eye center, area right behind
forehead, which, not incidentally, prefrontal cortex, cases
people will focus breathing, movement stomach movement
diaphragm lifting chest extension belly
breathe. that, taking ordinarily perceptual state split
outside world, exteroception, usually also toward inner state.
know, people generally touch feeling skin inward
also paying attention outside them. can think
somebody, instance, restaurant sandwich shop order sandwich
reading menu, exteroception, right? menu outside
confines skin. little ideas maybe big ideas come mind
roast beef sandwich vegetarian sandwich will taste like, will you,
it, like, don't like, et cetera. splitting interoception
exteroception. close eyes, stop, slow down, focus
breathing third eye center, majority perception shifts
interoception. shift end continuum interoception,
something important happens. happens two regions, ACC,
anterior cingulate cortex, insula, really ramp levels neural activity,


make perfect sense areas brain
registering paying attention various sensations full empty
stomach feels, whether not surface skin feels hot cold, on.
just sitting lying closing eyes, brain undergoes
massive shift exteroception interoception. Now, not say can't
distracted external events, and, fact, many people are, early stages
transitioning meditative state involve shift continuum, or,
say, one end continuum no down-up, just
continuum, shift along continuum heightened levels interoception. Now,
mentioned briefly before, many people interoceptively aware just
naturally, even don't meditation practice. people not.
pretty good measure whether not high levels interoceptive awareness
capability, ability count heartbeats without placing fingers
anywhere pressure take pulse. can like, can
actually try estimate number heartbeats simply trying feel heart
beat. people good, meaning accurate this,
people not. seem ability can trained quite bit, and,
fact, meditative practices will improve interoceptive awareness, but,
important point, heightened levels interoceptive awareness, might
sound attractive, oh, really touch body, not always beneficial,
why? many people who, instance, excessive levels anxiety
excessive levels anxiety keenly aware subtle shift
heart rate breathing change sensations within stomach. Whereas
people less aware bodily state, can beneficial, right? can
adaptive not, depending circumstances. probably not adaptive
very, aware internal state if, instance, public speaking,
don't want thinking going stomach quickly
breathing. certainly trying ignore signals, sensations now.
somebody no awareness going on, little interoceptive awareness,
can problematic, too, people can ignore fact
heart attack can ignore fact high blood
pressure carrying life focused everything external no awareness
body. They're, quote, unquote, touch body. want
careful placing valence, sort value good bad


interoceptive awareness versus exteroceptive awareness. importantly, want
emphasize undergo meditation practice, sort stop
movement close eyes, training interoceptive awareness.
becomes important later get discussions meditation reducing
anxiety. people may opt, fact, say people opt
meditative practice involves exteroceptive awareness, actually meditation
like walking meditation even seated meditation bringing focus
place outside body opposed inside body. fact,
examples people meditated quite lot develop heightened
state awareness interoceptive components, is, just fancy, again, nerd
speak aware breathing heart state gut
actually intrusive daily activities. will ask ask question
now. somebody tends touch bodily sensations, so,
instance, skin inwards? somebody tends less touch
aware interoceptive state? no right wrong answer. don't
get F D C depending answer. just good question
every one us answer, think people will answer depends.
depends whether not social setting whether not alone.
going return answer keep mind will become
beneficial building optimal meditation practice you. now, just note,
continuum perception, interoception exteroception. Closing eyes
increases interoception. Opening eyes dramatically increases exteroception just
automatically, just automatically much brain, fact, 40% more,
dedicated vision. this, say, low vision no
vision blind poor vision, entire process
translated auditory, sound domain, true people can see
true people can't see. course, people can't see, closing eyes
doesn't huge shift towards interoception, studies,
not many would've liked find, studies of, instance, people
blind low vision, don't see well, close ears
can't hear external world put headphones noise-canceling headphones,

00:42:20 Default Mode Network, Continuum Interoception & Exteroception



world inside becomes prominent relative world outside
obvious reasons. asked ask whether not
somebody tends interoceptively aware not, exteroceptively
aware not. might not able answer question,
can't, chances effectively sliding along continuum depending
activities doing. probably kind person somebody
comes starts talking you, will engage conversation,
don't feel inside body thinking heart beating
whether not flushing red, et cetera, going pay attention

perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,

attentional spotlighting, can place mind, thinking, memory,
cognition onto one things very, present past present

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone

terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient

incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general

Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail
before. research literature this, please let know. laboratory

collaborators. We, meaning Dr. David Spiegel expert hypnosis, again,

fact, associate chair psychiatry, world expert hypnosis,
podcast before, active research program focused issues.
much belief breathwork practice can meditative, meditation
practice can include breathing, meditative practice focuses
breathing itself, interoceptive-biased will be. Now, important
understand interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will specific effect,
make interoceptively aware. think back earlier
episode, many people, will wonderful thing something
actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can
beneficial.



01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice
reducing inflammatory cytokines, even improving outcomes cancer, reducing pain,
improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly
impact heart rate breathing. yanked around every experience.
instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person
environment breaking crying, yes, sad, important
sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, not get pulled
experience much lose ourselves. course areas
brain also leaning on, using metaphor, leaning
insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,
scared also going scared. push-pull
recognition distinct entities also, course, healthy desire
attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going
around you, dropping side continuum dissociated
not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people

placing oneself healthy model interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
covered lot information, like think given key
decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want
thing going allow feel rested tired going allow
adjust state mind not want whatever reason,
anxious exhausted, et cetera." people, say practice like


NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form

third eye meditation, relaxing, yet focus refocus
practice, whereas something like yoga nidra NSDR going along
lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing
sleep need. previous podcasts, talked hypnosis, particularly
episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get
hypnosis now, just understand hypnosis distinct breathwork, yoga
nidra, NSDR, meditation even though includes
components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual
attention outward inward go hypnosis, involves breathing
particular kind, involves specific imagery, et cetera. hypnosis distinct
hypnosis really designed fix address specific problem, whereas meditation,
NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically not. can help fix problems
anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, generally not directed toward particular

always, especially clinical context, not stage hypnosis, clinical context
lot research show can, instance, help quitting smoking,
literally quadrupling effectiveness smoking cessation something like
Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
reducing pain number things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis really


great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts

focus perception right now big toe right foot
really pour awareness, attention perceiving there,
feels like, tingling pressure, heat cold, et cetera, can broaden
spotlight include feet toes feet legs
whole body entire room. Perception like spotlight, mention
good data can split attention two probably not
two spotlights, can make spotlights perception either broad
diffuse narrow. can practice now like. can pick spot
wall away anywhere, driving, can look location,
can focus intensely one small location, instance, tree horizon
person street number different things outside you, can broaden
spotlight include entire scene once. can also focus spotlight
perception body, say left upper portion chest. course
can focus left upper portion chest something outside you, can
split attention two perceptual spotlights. hard, although not
impossible, three perceptual spotlights, people can split two points
attention perception pretty easily. thing people can pretty
easily merge two spotlights or, rather, just one spotlight attention.
don't always two spotlights attention on, here, using
word attention perception interchangeably. could, instance, two
points attention, talking somebody paying attention whether
not somebody's walking door not, two, completely
focused person talking to, completely focused
stomach ache great sensation hunger belly talking
somebody, fact, not even listening saying all. Okay?
two spotlights perception. can split merge one. And,
important, spotlights perception can intensify dim, there,
using analogy. mean perception happening within
spotlights can very, high acuity. is, can register fine changes

look example happens sit lie close eyes

happens level surface skin inside bodies. informs
us something important, actually two axes two ends
continuum perception. now, talking perception
intention kind thing, indeed are, least sake
conversation, within word perception within word attention,
continuum, continuum one end something called interoception.
Interoception, spelled I, everything sense level skin
inward, sensation inside stomach, sensation heart beating.
people can sense heart beating pretty easily. people challenge
that. feeling surface skin, hot cold feel,
interoception. contrast, end continuum so-called exteroception,
spelled E. Exteroception perception everything outside beyond
confines skin. shutting eyes, particular, meditative practice
direct attention toward so-called third eye center, area right behind
forehead, which, not incidentally, prefrontal cortex, cases
people will focus breathing, movement stomach movement

breathe. that, taking ordinarily perceptual state split
outside world, exteroception, usually also toward inner state.
know, people generally touch feeling skin inward
also paying attention outside them. can think
somebody, instance, restaurant sandwich shop order sandwich

just sitting lying closing eyes, brain undergoes
massive shift exteroception interoception. Now, not say can't
distracted external events, and, fact, many people are, early stages
transitioning meditative state involve shift continuum, or,
say, one end continuum no down-up, just
continuum, shift along continuum heightened levels interoception. Now,
mentioned briefly before, many people interoceptively aware just
naturally, even don't meditation practice. people not.

people not. seem ability can trained quite bit, and,
fact, meditative practices will improve interoceptive awareness, but,
important point, heightened levels interoceptive awareness, might
sound attractive, oh, really touch body, not always beneficial,
why? many people who, instance, excessive levels anxiety

cool name. talks something important will come
today's conversation, something called default mode network.
default mode network collection different brain areas essentially
active not much anything certainly active not
focused one particular task conversation activity. default mode network can
thought less network generates mind wandering
thoughts drifting past present future. Remember, earlier, talked
perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,
present, future two three things, okay? Just like
attentional spotlighting, can place mind, thinking, memory,
cognition onto one things very, present past present
forth. default mode network, involves lot different brain
areas, can thought simply network brain areas active

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms

things will become present feelings, emotions, is, thoughts
memories, will often arrive seems disorganized fashion.
reason arrive somewhat disorganized fashion because, normally,
just don't perceive things way. Normally, splitting attention,
perception, is, multiple things, sensation thoughts. put
perception thoughts, see disorganized, wandering
how, fact, random intrusive can be. Again, random intrusive.

terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?

answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether

set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne

key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient

hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,

mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible

continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin

bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental

Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,

thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay

exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount

actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent

Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,

meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better

typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,

people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases

pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast

fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts

look example happens sit lie close eyes
decide meditate, immediately realize tremendous shift
perceptual ability, why? spotlight attention, can oriented
toward, instance, hear room maybe feeling wind moving


trees environment happen in, close eyes, shut
one major avenues sensory input, vision. that,
tendency perceptual spotlights focused
happens level surface skin inside bodies. informs
us something important, actually two axes two ends
continuum perception. now, talking perception
intention kind thing, indeed are, least sake
conversation, within word perception within word attention,
continuum, continuum one end something called interoception.
Interoception, spelled I, everything sense level skin
inward, sensation inside stomach, sensation heart beating.
people can sense heart beating pretty easily. people challenge
that. feeling surface skin, hot cold feel,
interoception. contrast, end continuum so-called exteroception,
spelled E. Exteroception perception everything outside beyond
confines skin. shutting eyes, particular, meditative practice
direct attention toward so-called third eye center, area right behind
forehead, which, not incidentally, prefrontal cortex, cases
people will focus breathing, movement stomach movement
diaphragm lifting chest extension belly
breathe. that, taking ordinarily perceptual state split
outside world, exteroception, usually also toward inner state.
know, people generally touch feeling skin inward
also paying attention outside them. can think
somebody, instance, restaurant sandwich shop order sandwich
reading menu, exteroception, right? menu outside
confines skin. little ideas maybe big ideas come mind
roast beef sandwich vegetarian sandwich will taste like, will you,
it, like, don't like, et cetera. splitting interoception
exteroception. close eyes, stop, slow down, focus
breathing third eye center, majority perception shifts
interoception. shift end continuum interoception,
something important happens. happens two regions, ACC,
anterior cingulate cortex, insula, really ramp levels neural activity,


make perfect sense areas brain
registering paying attention various sensations full empty
stomach feels, whether not surface skin feels hot cold, on.
just sitting lying closing eyes, brain undergoes
massive shift exteroception interoception. Now, not say can't
distracted external events, and, fact, many people are, early stages
transitioning meditative state involve shift continuum, or,
say, one end continuum no down-up, just
continuum, shift along continuum heightened levels interoception. Now,
mentioned briefly before, many people interoceptively aware just
naturally, even don't meditation practice. people not.
pretty good measure whether not high levels interoceptive awareness
capability, ability count heartbeats without placing fingers
anywhere pressure take pulse. can like, can
actually try estimate number heartbeats simply trying feel heart
beat. people good, meaning accurate this,
people not. seem ability can trained quite bit, and,
fact, meditative practices will improve interoceptive awareness, but,
important point, heightened levels interoceptive awareness, might
sound attractive, oh, really touch body, not always beneficial,
why? many people who, instance, excessive levels anxiety
excessive levels anxiety keenly aware subtle shift
heart rate breathing change sensations within stomach. Whereas
people less aware bodily state, can beneficial, right? can
adaptive not, depending circumstances. probably not adaptive
very, aware internal state if, instance, public speaking,
don't want thinking going stomach quickly
breathing. certainly trying ignore signals, sensations now.
somebody no awareness going on, little interoceptive awareness,
can problematic, too, people can ignore fact
heart attack can ignore fact high blood
pressure carrying life focused everything external no awareness
body. They're, quote, unquote, touch body. want
careful placing valence, sort value good bad


interoceptive awareness versus exteroceptive awareness. importantly, want
emphasize undergo meditation practice, sort stop
movement close eyes, training interoceptive awareness.
becomes important later get discussions meditation reducing
anxiety. people may opt, fact, say people opt
meditative practice involves exteroceptive awareness, actually meditation
like walking meditation even seated meditation bringing focus
place outside body opposed inside body. fact,
examples people meditated quite lot develop heightened
state awareness interoceptive components, is, just fancy, again, nerd
speak aware breathing heart state gut
actually intrusive daily activities. will ask ask question
now. somebody tends touch bodily sensations, so,
instance, skin inwards? somebody tends less touch
aware interoceptive state? no right wrong answer. don't
get F D C depending answer. just good question
every one us answer, think people will answer depends.
depends whether not social setting whether not alone.
going return answer keep mind will become
beneficial building optimal meditation practice you. now, just note,
continuum perception, interoception exteroception. Closing eyes
increases interoception. Opening eyes dramatically increases exteroception just
automatically, just automatically much brain, fact, 40% more,
dedicated vision. this, say, low vision no
vision blind poor vision, entire process
translated auditory, sound domain, true people can see
true people can't see. course, people can't see, closing eyes
doesn't huge shift towards interoception, studies,
not many would've liked find, studies of, instance, people
blind low vision, don't see well, close ears
can't hear external world put headphones noise-canceling headphones,

00:42:20 Default Mode Network, Continuum Interoception & Exteroception



world inside becomes prominent relative world outside
obvious reasons. asked ask whether not
somebody tends interoceptively aware not, exteroceptively
aware not. might not able answer question,
can't, chances effectively sliding along continuum depending
activities doing. probably kind person somebody
comes starts talking you, will engage conversation,
don't feel inside body thinking heart beating
whether not flushing red, et cetera, going pay attention
say. Many people, however, somebody talks them, social anxiety
even slight bit social anxiety, will thinking whether not cheeks

exteroceptive awareness. And, course, context dependent. will depend
whether not you're, know, date somebody that, know,

person tell kind thing. mean one location

means neurally, right? know interoceptively aware,
insula ACC active, not useful. not helpful tool.
just fact. Now, actually studies meditation practice can
terms moving along continuum naturally sit order help
function not just meditation times. order illustrate this,
want start description now classic study. cool study,
cool name. talks something important will come
today's conversation, something called default mode network.
default mode network collection different brain areas essentially
active not much anything certainly active not
focused one particular task conversation activity. default mode network can
thought less network generates mind wandering
thoughts drifting past present future. Remember, earlier, talked
perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,
present, future two three things, okay? Just like
attentional spotlighting, can place mind, thinking, memory,
cognition onto one things very, present past present
forth. default mode network, involves lot different brain
areas, can thought simply network brain areas active
mind wandering different time domains. paper like share
you, mentioned before, now classic paper, wonderful title,
Wandering Mind Unhappy Mind. Now, sounds almost like news article
news article scientific paper, actually title scientific paper
published journal, "Science," one three apex journals.
know, scientific publishing competitive, especially competitive get
manuscripts accepted "Science," "Nature," journal "Cell,"
represents kind Super Bowl, NBA Championships, Stanley Cup, will,
sports aficionados scientific publishing. paper Matthew
Killingsworth Dan Gilbert. published 2010, still considered classic.
paper, Wandering Mind Unhappy Mind, number important
points. going paraphrase certain elements say
essentially like know far better say. first all,
started statement, confess disagree with, is, "Unlike
animals, human beings spend lot time thinking not going around
them: contemplating events happened past, might happen future, will
never happen all." agree assertion human beings that.
certainly experience, although must say, don't think evidence
whatsoever animals don't also. apologies, Killingsworth
Gilbert, happy go toe-to-toe that. not aware data
prove one way animals thinking. set aside


animals, focus human animal. Now, point still good one,
humans wandering mind call stimulus-
independent thought. is, nothing happening create thoughts
anything happening immediate environment. thoughts just happening
internally. default mode network. study important.
fact, landmark study right time smartphones
became widely available use, again, 2010. basically pinged people,
contacted people iPhones many times per day, well
2,200 adults. mix male female people study. mean
age 34 years, range, mean, course, average,

important points came data, and, again, large data set,
that, again, paraphrasing, first, people's minds wandered frequently

whether not tend interoceptively dominant, right, tend pay
attention bodily sensations, exteroceptively dominant. And, again, don't
know answer question, simple test can do. can just sit
lie down, close eyes, can ask assess whether not

use determine meditation given moment. say
somebody regular meditator say somebody never

please don't close eyes driving, sort obvious, safe

depending circumstance are. suggest opening eyes
trying focus attention something external seeing evaluating
extent can divorce perception sensations occur level

sit down, instance, notice can equally split attention

meditation perhaps perform moment. Let give example
this. stop way, sit lie down, close eyes,
evaluate whether not can essentially rule eliminate attention

01:01:48 State & Trait Changes, Interoceptive & Exteroceptive Meditations, Refocusing

actively try suppress bias toward interoceptive
exteroceptive. Now, think immensely beneficial, immediate changes
experience, others called state change, is,
also can lead to, referred earlier, neuroplasticity, changes
brain circuits underlie default mode network lead called
trait changes. want clear not first make state versus
trait distinction. distinction raised really wonderful book. fact,
can't recommend book highly enough. book "Altered Traits: Science Reveals
Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body." book Daniel
Goleman Richard Davidson who've done terrific work many writings many
TED Talks, et cetera, meditation. say circa 2016, 2017, book
really captured believe essential elements science
meditation lot history well. Today, focusing much
covered book also lot things happened, excuse me, since 2017.
fact, papers going talk papers published
2017. But, again, wonderful book clearly distinguish

ones. read book literature follows is, again, sit
meditate, going effective interoceptive, exteroceptive
bias assessment. Ask whether not head outside

focused going around you, pushes internally.
Now, think people familiar interoceptive-biased meditation.
Again, setting timer. Maybe don't even set timer, just sit
lie down, close eyes, focus third eye center behind forehead
focus breathing bodily sensations. typical often discussed.

time refocus, going one level, another stair, another stair, another

"Ugh, like, can't focus anything." Pretty soon, notice refocusing
process will happen quickly don't even perceive it. And, again,
something borne neuroimaging data. lot people think can


focus laser precision, actually, better refocusing

earlier, mentioned interoceptive-biased exteroceptive-biased meditation
three minutes. say three minutes? Well, three minutes seems like
reasonable number people consistently, know, day.
fact, studies one-minute meditations three-minute meditations
10 60. laboratory studying 5-minute-a-day meditation,
clearly benefits, think also clear three minutes, many benefits

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms
art will picture face eyes will closed sometimes open,
there'll literally third eye, like cyclops eye middle forehead.
proposed many thousands years be, quote, unquote, seat
consciousness. Now, interesting real estate behind forehead
actually turns prefrontal cortex, know lesion studies
stimulation studies, remove brain area, people become reflexive.
not thinking intentionally, don't become deliberate. fact, kind


eerie result, inactivate, turn off prefrontal cortex give
somebody opportunity play shooting game, instance, accuracy goes
roof. become essentially like machine. see stimulus,
shoot it, see stimulus, shoot it. accuracy exceptional,
ability distinguish enemy friend completely disappears. become
highly effective motor, say sensory motor machine, assessment
judgment right wrong completely disappears. also true
people prefrontal damage. often will inappropriate behavior
hard time suppressing behaviors, et cetera. third eye center seat
consciousness intention something makes sense generally
know neuroscience neurology, something think

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient

different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,

hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,

sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered

significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get

encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught

sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is

gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation

focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical

instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also

instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience

take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked

mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.

know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural

answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find

times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered

NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation

us something important, actually two axes two ends
continuum perception. now, talking perception
intention kind thing, indeed are, least sake
conversation, within word perception within word attention,
continuum, continuum one end something called interoception.
Interoception, spelled I, everything sense level skin
inward, sensation inside stomach, sensation heart beating.
people can sense heart beating pretty easily. people challenge
that. feeling surface skin, hot cold feel,
interoception. contrast, end continuum so-called exteroception,
spelled E. Exteroception perception everything outside beyond
confines skin. shutting eyes, particular, meditative practice
direct attention toward so-called third eye center, area right behind
forehead, which, not incidentally, prefrontal cortex, cases
people will focus breathing, movement stomach movement
diaphragm lifting chest extension belly
breathe. that, taking ordinarily perceptual state split
outside world, exteroception, usually also toward inner state.
know, people generally touch feeling skin inward
also paying attention outside them. can think
somebody, instance, restaurant sandwich shop order sandwich
reading menu, exteroception, right? menu outside
confines skin. little ideas maybe big ideas come mind
roast beef sandwich vegetarian sandwich will taste like, will you,
it, like, don't like, et cetera. splitting interoception
exteroception. close eyes, stop, slow down, focus
breathing third eye center, majority perception shifts
interoception. shift end continuum interoception,
something important happens. happens two regions, ACC,
anterior cingulate cortex, insula, really ramp levels neural activity,


make perfect sense areas brain
registering paying attention various sensations full empty
stomach feels, whether not surface skin feels hot cold, on.
just sitting lying closing eyes, brain undergoes
massive shift exteroception interoception. Now, not say can't
distracted external events, and, fact, many people are, early stages
transitioning meditative state involve shift continuum, or,
say, one end continuum no down-up, just
continuum, shift along continuum heightened levels interoception. Now,
mentioned briefly before, many people interoceptively aware just
naturally, even don't meditation practice. people not.
pretty good measure whether not high levels interoceptive awareness
capability, ability count heartbeats without placing fingers
anywhere pressure take pulse. can like, can
actually try estimate number heartbeats simply trying feel heart
beat. people good, meaning accurate this,
people not. seem ability can trained quite bit, and,
fact, meditative practices will improve interoceptive awareness, but,
important point, heightened levels interoceptive awareness, might
sound attractive, oh, really touch body, not always beneficial,
why? many people who, instance, excessive levels anxiety
excessive levels anxiety keenly aware subtle shift
heart rate breathing change sensations within stomach. Whereas
people less aware bodily state, can beneficial, right? can
adaptive not, depending circumstances. probably not adaptive
very, aware internal state if, instance, public speaking,
don't want thinking going stomach quickly

somebody no awareness going on, little interoceptive awareness,
can problematic, too, people can ignore fact
heart attack can ignore fact high blood

careful placing valence, sort value good bad


interoceptive awareness versus exteroceptive awareness. importantly, want
emphasize undergo meditation practice, sort stop

becomes important later get discussions meditation reducing

meditative practice involves exteroceptive awareness, actually meditation
like walking meditation even seated meditation bringing focus
place outside body opposed inside body. fact,
examples people meditated quite lot develop heightened
state awareness interoceptive components, is, just fancy, again, nerd
speak aware breathing heart state gut
actually intrusive daily activities. will ask ask question
now. somebody tends touch bodily sensations, so,
instance, skin inwards? somebody tends less touch
aware interoceptive state? no right wrong answer. don't
get F D C depending answer. just good question
every one us answer, think people will answer depends.
depends whether not social setting whether not alone.
going return answer keep mind will become
beneficial building optimal meditation practice you. now, just note,
continuum perception, interoception exteroception. Closing eyes
increases interoception. Opening eyes dramatically increases exteroception just
automatically, just automatically much brain, fact, 40% more,
dedicated vision. this, say, low vision no
vision blind poor vision, entire process
translated auditory, sound domain, true people can see
true people can't see. course, people can't see, closing eyes
doesn't huge shift towards interoception, studies,
not many would've liked find, studies of, instance, people
blind low vision, don't see well, close ears
can't hear external world put headphones noise-canceling headphones,

obvious reasons. asked ask whether not
somebody tends interoceptively aware not, exteroceptively

can't, chances effectively sliding along continuum depending

just fact. Now, actually studies meditation practice can
terms moving along continuum naturally sit order help
function not just meditation times. order illustrate this,
want start description now classic study. cool study,
cool name. talks something important will come
today's conversation, something called default mode network.
default mode network collection different brain areas essentially
active not much anything certainly active not
focused one particular task conversation activity. default mode network can
thought less network generates mind wandering
thoughts drifting past present future. Remember, earlier, talked
perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,
present, future two three things, okay? Just like
attentional spotlighting, can place mind, thinking, memory,
cognition onto one things very, present past present
forth. default mode network, involves lot different brain
areas, can thought simply network brain areas active
mind wandering different time domains. paper like share
you, mentioned before, now classic paper, wonderful title,
Wandering Mind Unhappy Mind. Now, sounds almost like news article
news article scientific paper, actually title scientific paper

Killingsworth Dan Gilbert. published 2010, still considered classic.
paper, Wandering Mind Unhappy Mind, number important
points. going paraphrase certain elements say
essentially like know far better say. first all,
started statement, confess disagree with, is, "Unlike
animals, human beings spend lot time thinking not going around
them: contemplating events happened past, might happen future, will
never happen all." agree assertion human beings that.
certainly experience, although must say, don't think evidence
whatsoever animals don't also. apologies, Killingsworth
Gilbert, happy go toe-to-toe that. not aware data
prove one way animals thinking. set aside


animals, focus human animal. Now, point still good one,
humans wandering mind call stimulus-
independent thought. is, nothing happening create thoughts
anything happening immediate environment. thoughts just happening
internally. default mode network. study important.
fact, landmark study right time smartphones
became widely available use, again, 2010. basically pinged people,
contacted people iPhones many times per day, well
2,200 adults. mix male female people study. mean

sit down, instance, notice can equally split attention

this. stop way, sit lie down, close eyes,
evaluate whether not can essentially rule eliminate attention

Now, think people familiar interoceptive-biased meditation.
Again, setting timer. Maybe don't even set timer, just sit

big fan now fairly long meditations. 10 20
minutes least every day often every day, convinced check
Waking app Sam Harris put out. looked it, think sits
behind paywall, can access much least trial try without
get behind paywall. not sponsor podcast,
mention, decided use Waking app. think terrific, think one
reasons terrific Sam includes short descriptions meditation
specific meditation can just prior meditation.
meditations can quite brief. minute long, two minutes long,
longer even quite bit longer. app, think, includes variety
meditations really encompasses huge range possibilities possible
meditation, that, least experience Waking app, led
consistent meditation practice. And, course, love get Sam
podcast guest talk sort underpinnings Waking
app views everything meditation to, know big discussion
free will consciousness, deep somewhat abstract
discussions. really hope get Sam podcast time not far now.
Meanwhile, never met person, absolutely love Waking app, Sam,
know father well, know many already use it.

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms

there'll literally third eye, like cyclops eye middle forehead.

earlier, issue long practice. lot different data
these, practices covered podcast
guests, instance, highlighted 13-minute meditation Dr. Wendy Suzuki
New York University's laboratory popularized, popularized
wonderful paper will provide link shows daily 13-minute
meditation, traditional third eye, interoceptively biased, focus
breathing, focus location directly behind one's forehead both,
meditation done daily eight weeks, maybe shorter, study, eight
weeks, greatly improved mood, improved ability sleep, improved cognitive ability


focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day
meditation. However, trying establish long meditate, ask
couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne
data covered "Altered Traits." also borne recent studies
come since book published. Consistency key, ask

talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,
exhale, controlling duration inhale, breath hold, exhale, breath hold, repeat, so-
called box breathing inhale, hold, exhale, hold
equivalent durations. number different breathing patterns, slow cyclic breathing,
box breathing, cadence three six seconds in, holding two seconds, seven
seconds out, regardless cadence breathing one uses, tendency
meditative practices slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing
deliberate fashion. essential default breathing, is,


don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces
us interoception. Why? diaphragm, muscle helps move
lungs essentially create specific cadence breathing depth breathing one
box breathing deliberately slow breathing, well, muscle resides inside
us, focus breathing, often not, aren't focused
actual air leaving nasal passages mouth, maybe little bit, typically,
forced focus just default focusing movement diaphragm

one focusing interoceptive perceptions within body exteroceptive

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice
going best serve goals. since not episode

can shift brain body state. that, however, want give

become alert? Simple question. can decide session session.
even switch within session. just need assess whether not
leaning interoceptively exteroceptively, also need ask yourself,
need calm want calm down, want alert end
meditation session? maybe want go state deep relaxation
exit alertness. way simple using breathwork
specific patterns breathing. general rule supported
respiration physiology aware of. oversimplifying here, oversimplifying
intentionally can simply apply tool. then, mentioned before, will

communicate brain areas release noradrenaline norepinephrine, et
cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale
longer exhale, make vigorous?" Well, simply means
drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend
exhales relative inhales, can even make active exhales. can
inhale [inhales exhales], exhale [inhales exhales]. going shift
nervous system direction calm. And, course, like stay
level alertness aka calmness two sides seesaw
continuum, like right end meditation
started, least terms levels alertness calmness, well,
just keep inhales exhales relatively balanced terms
duration. Now, introduction things like breath holds box breathing Wim Hof
breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail

much belief breathwork practice can meditative, meditation

understand interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will specific effect,
make interoceptively aware. think back earlier

actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice

improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly

instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person

insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,

attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk

can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands

ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form

course, states all, frankly, go time time

right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life

not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing

practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating

distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent

memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice

terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least

happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better

decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want

third eye meditation, relaxing, yet focus refocus
practice, whereas something like yoga nidra NSDR going along
lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing
sleep need. previous podcasts, talked hypnosis, particularly
episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get
hypnosis now, just understand hypnosis distinct breathwork, yoga
nidra, NSDR, meditation even though includes
components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer

not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct

cool name. talks something important will come
today's conversation, something called default mode network.
default mode network collection different brain areas essentially
active not much anything certainly active not
focused one particular task conversation activity. default mode network can
thought less network generates mind wandering
thoughts drifting past present future. Remember, earlier, talked
perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,
present, future two three things, okay? Just like
attentional spotlighting, can place mind, thinking, memory,
cognition onto one things very, present past present

points. going paraphrase certain elements say
essentially like know far better say. first all,

animals, human beings spend lot time thinking not going around
them: contemplating events happened past, might happen future, will
never happen all." agree assertion human beings that.

improvement process. Think ascending staircase refocusing. Every
time refocus, going one level, another stair, another stair, another
stair, think will move away kind judgmental process thinking,
"Ugh, like, can't focus anything." Pretty soon, notice refocusing
process will happen quickly don't even perceive it. And, again,
something borne neuroimaging data. lot people think can


focus laser precision, actually, better refocusing
quickly consistently time. classic study experienced
meditators done Japan people varying levels
meditation ability, never meditated, others really expert

people listen 20 tones repeated over, tone,
found expert meditators really focus, brain
imaging, really focus 20 tones, whereas people kind attenuate
called habituate tone 10th 11th tone, mind really

One particular using actually started using dad
big fan now fairly long meditations. 10 20
minutes least every day often every day, convinced check
Waking app Sam Harris put out. looked it, think sits

get behind paywall. not sponsor podcast,
mention, decided use Waking app. think terrific, think one
reasons terrific Sam includes short descriptions meditation
specific meditation can just prior meditation.
meditations can quite brief. minute long, two minutes long,
longer even quite bit longer. app, think, includes variety
meditations really encompasses huge range possibilities possible
meditation, that, least experience Waking app, led
consistent meditation practice. And, course, love get Sam
podcast guest talk sort underpinnings Waking
app views everything meditation to, know big discussion
free will consciousness, deep somewhat abstract
discussions. really hope get Sam podcast time not far now.
Meanwhile, never met person, absolutely love Waking app, Sam,
know father well, know many already use it.

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms

focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day

couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne

talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,
exhale, controlling duration inhale, breath hold, exhale, breath hold, repeat, so-
called box breathing inhale, hold, exhale, hold

box breathing, cadence three six seconds in, holding two seconds, seven
seconds out, regardless cadence breathing one uses, tendency
meditative practices slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing
deliberate fashion. essential default breathing, is,


don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces

lungs essentially create specific cadence breathing depth breathing one
box breathing deliberately slow breathing, well, muscle resides inside

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice

cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale
longer exhale, make vigorous?" Well, simply means
drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend

just keep inhales exhales relatively balanced terms

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],

going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits

improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD

basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative

focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context

instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental

Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,

mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical

know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer

the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might

rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much

translated auditory, sound domain, true people can see
true people can't see. course, people can't see, closing eyes

want start description now classic study. cool study,
cool name. talks something important will come
today's conversation, something called default mode network.
default mode network collection different brain areas essentially
active not much anything certainly active not
focused one particular task conversation activity. default mode network can
thought less network generates mind wandering
thoughts drifting past present future. Remember, earlier, talked
perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,
present, future two three things, okay? Just like
attentional spotlighting, can place mind, thinking, memory,
cognition onto one things very, present past present

areas, can thought simply network brain areas active

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms

New York University's laboratory popularized, popularized
wonderful paper will provide link shows daily 13-minute

focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day

couple questions. First all, practice can

answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne

talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,

don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general

cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous

drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales

exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,

going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits

improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD

basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative

focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible

continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum

Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,

mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say

know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount

actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?

interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode

happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better

Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer

the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much

thoughts drifting past present future. Remember, earlier, talked
perceptual spotlight can either two spotlights can merge.


Well, similarly, human beings can think past, surely, present, definitely,
future. turns can also split thoughts just like can split
perception two three things, can think past, past event,
can think present. can split thinking memory way. can
also think present future. can also think future
past, although difficult, although not impossible, split one's thinking
memory past, present, future simultaneously, not easily done, pretty
easy split one's attention thinking two three things, either past,

points. going paraphrase certain elements say
essentially like know far better say. first all,
started statement, confess disagree with, is, "Unlike
animals, human beings spend lot time thinking not going around
them: contemplating events happened past, might happen future, will
never happen all." agree assertion human beings that.

time refocus, going one level, another stair, another stair, another
stair, think will move away kind judgmental process thinking,
"Ugh, like, can't focus anything." Pretty soon, notice refocusing
process will happen quickly don't even perceive it. And, again,
something borne neuroimaging data. lot people think can


focus laser precision, actually, better refocusing
quickly consistently time. classic study experienced
meditators done Japan people varying levels
meditation ability, never meditated, others really expert
meditators many hundreds not thousands hours meditation belt,
people listen 20 tones repeated over, tone,
found expert meditators really focus, brain
imaging, really focus 20 tones, whereas people kind attenuate
called habituate tone 10th 11th tone, mind really
going something else. Now, wonderful, really just tells us expert
meditators better focus. turns modern neuroimaging studies
shown don't better focus staying narrow
trench focus. exiting focus going back

three minutes. say three minutes? Well, three minutes seems like
reasonable number people consistently, know, day.
fact, studies one-minute meditations three-minute meditations
10 60. laboratory studying 5-minute-a-day meditation,
clearly benefits, think also clear three minutes, many benefits
starting arrive. not pointing one particular data point here,
clear forcing oneself direct one's perception, is, attention,
internal state something external immensely beneficial
consistently is, again, especially beneficial focusing attention
portion experience, either internal external you, not one
default moment. people taken extreme say
that, know, can even just move day, every while,
just one breath meditation. honest, look whole data,
seems doesn't really matter order derive benefits meditation


practice. Now, big fan newer meditation apps there.
One particular using actually started using dad
big fan now fairly long meditations. 10 20
minutes least every day often every day, convinced check
Waking app Sam Harris put out. looked it, think sits
behind paywall, can access much least trial try without
get behind paywall. not sponsor podcast,
mention, decided use Waking app. think terrific, think one
reasons terrific Sam includes short descriptions meditation
specific meditation can just prior meditation.
meditations can quite brief. minute long, two minutes long,
longer even quite bit longer. app, think, includes variety
meditations really encompasses huge range possibilities possible
meditation, that, least experience Waking app, led
consistent meditation practice. And, course, love get Sam
podcast guest talk sort underpinnings Waking
app views everything meditation to, know big discussion
free will consciousness, deep somewhat abstract
discussions. really hope get Sam podcast time not far now.
Meanwhile, never met person, absolutely love Waking app, Sam,
know father well, know many already use it.

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms

Whereas exteroceptively focused given moment, well,

earlier, issue long practice. lot different data
these, practices covered podcast
guests, instance, highlighted 13-minute meditation Dr. Wendy Suzuki
New York University's laboratory popularized, popularized
wonderful paper will provide link shows daily 13-minute
meditation, traditional third eye, interoceptively biased, focus
breathing, focus location directly behind one's forehead both,

weeks, greatly improved mood, improved ability sleep, improved cognitive ability


focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day
meditation. However, trying establish long meditate, ask
couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne
data covered "Altered Traits." also borne recent studies
come since book published. Consistency key, ask

talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,
exhale, controlling duration inhale, breath hold, exhale, breath hold, repeat, so-
called box breathing inhale, hold, exhale, hold

box breathing, cadence three six seconds in, holding two seconds, seven
seconds out, regardless cadence breathing one uses, tendency
meditative practices slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing
deliberate fashion. essential default breathing, is,


don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces
us interoception. Why? diaphragm, muscle helps move
lungs essentially create specific cadence breathing depth breathing one
box breathing deliberately slow breathing, well, muscle resides inside

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice

cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale
longer exhale, make vigorous?" Well, simply means
drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend

just keep inhales exhales relatively balanced terms

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits

focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible

continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context

instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum

Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,

mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.

thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny

Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find

Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening

commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms

these, practices covered podcast
guests, instance, highlighted 13-minute meditation Dr. Wendy Suzuki
New York University's laboratory popularized, popularized
wonderful paper will provide link shows daily 13-minute
meditation, traditional third eye, interoceptively biased, focus
breathing, focus location directly behind one's forehead both,
meditation done daily eight weeks, maybe shorter, study, eight
weeks, greatly improved mood, improved ability sleep, improved cognitive ability


focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day
meditation. However, trying establish long meditate, ask
couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne

talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,
exhale, controlling duration inhale, breath hold, exhale, breath hold, repeat, so-
called box breathing inhale, hold, exhale, hold
equivalent durations. number different breathing patterns, slow cyclic breathing,
box breathing, cadence three six seconds in, holding two seconds, seven
seconds out, regardless cadence breathing one uses, tendency
meditative practices slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing
deliberate fashion. essential default breathing, is,


don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces
us interoception. Why? diaphragm, muscle helps move
lungs essentially create specific cadence breathing depth breathing one
box breathing deliberately slow breathing, well, muscle resides inside
us, focus breathing, often not, aren't focused
actual air leaving nasal passages mouth, maybe little bit, typically,

one focusing interoceptive perceptions within body exteroceptive

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice
going best serve goals. since not episode

exit alertness. way simple using breathwork
specific patterns breathing. general rule supported
respiration physiology aware of. oversimplifying here, oversimplifying
intentionally can simply apply tool. then, mentioned before, will

communicate brain areas release noradrenaline norepinephrine, et
cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale
longer exhale, make vigorous?" Well, simply means
drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend
exhales relative inhales, can even make active exhales. can
inhale [inhales exhales], exhale [inhales exhales]. going shift
nervous system direction calm. And, course, like stay
level alertness aka calmness two sides seesaw
continuum, like right end meditation
started, least terms levels alertness calmness, well,
just keep inhales exhales relatively balanced terms
duration. Now, introduction things like breath holds box breathing Wim Hof
breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail

understand interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will specific effect,
make interoceptively aware. think back earlier

actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice
reducing inflammatory cytokines, even improving outcomes cancer, reducing pain,
improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly

instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person

insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,

attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially

still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even

01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want

completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands

ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form

course, states all, frankly, go time time

right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life

actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing

practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation

them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long

guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases

welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now

common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better

times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding

furthest distance can see. Now, useful window

try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,

different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within

Now, think people familiar interoceptive-biased meditation.
Again, setting timer. Maybe don't even set timer, just sit

"Ugh, like, can't focus anything." Pretty soon, notice refocusing

something borne neuroimaging data. lot people think can


focus laser precision, actually, better refocusing
quickly consistently time. classic study experienced

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms

there'll literally third eye, like cyclops eye middle forehead.

especially important goes beyond anything ancient traditions

mean that? Well, touch top hand, can feel that. want sense

bringing attentional, perceptual spotlight location no

focusing that, quote, unquote, third eye center, prefrontal cortex,

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient

breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,

meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.

mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get

gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits

focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical

instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also

instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience

mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.

thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense

meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,

Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding

meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better

typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,

people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought

pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get

took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also

also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,

interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec

try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,

different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within

Now, think people familiar interoceptive-biased meditation.
Again, setting timer. Maybe don't even set timer, just sit

improvement process. Think ascending staircase refocusing. Every
time refocus, going one level, another stair, another stair, another
stair, think will move away kind judgmental process thinking,
"Ugh, like, can't focus anything." Pretty soon, notice refocusing
process will happen quickly don't even perceive it. And, again,
something borne neuroimaging data. lot people think can


focus laser precision, actually, better refocusing
quickly consistently time. classic study experienced
meditators done Japan people varying levels
meditation ability, never meditated, others really expert

found expert meditators really focus, brain
imaging, really focus 20 tones, whereas people kind attenuate
called habituate tone 10th 11th tone, mind really

three minutes. say three minutes? Well, three minutes seems like
reasonable number people consistently, know, day.
fact, studies one-minute meditations three-minute meditations
10 60. laboratory studying 5-minute-a-day meditation,
clearly benefits, think also clear three minutes, many benefits
starting arrive. not pointing one particular data point here,
clear forcing oneself direct one's perception, is, attention,

consistently is, again, especially beneficial focusing attention
portion experience, either internal external you, not one

that, know, can even just move day, every while,
just one breath meditation. honest, look whole data,
seems doesn't really matter order derive benefits meditation


practice. Now, big fan newer meditation apps there.
One particular using actually started using dad
big fan now fairly long meditations. 10 20
minutes least every day often every day, convinced check
Waking app Sam Harris put out. looked it, think sits

mention, decided use Waking app. think terrific, think one
reasons terrific Sam includes short descriptions meditation
specific meditation can just prior meditation.
meditations can quite brief. minute long, two minutes long,
longer even quite bit longer. app, think, includes variety
meditations really encompasses huge range possibilities possible
meditation, that, least experience Waking app, led
consistent meditation practice. And, course, love get Sam
podcast guest talk sort underpinnings Waking
app views everything meditation to, know big discussion
free will consciousness, deep somewhat abstract

Meanwhile, never met person, absolutely love Waking app, Sam,
know father well, know many already use it.

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms
art will picture face eyes will closed sometimes open,
there'll literally third eye, like cyclops eye middle forehead.
proposed many thousands years be, quote, unquote, seat

actually turns prefrontal cortex, know lesion studies
stimulation studies, remove brain area, people become reflexive.
not thinking intentionally, don't become deliberate. fact, kind


eerie result, inactivate, turn off prefrontal cortex give
somebody opportunity play shooting game, instance, accuracy goes
roof. become essentially like machine. see stimulus,
shoot it, see stimulus, shoot it. accuracy exceptional,

judgment right wrong completely disappears. also true
people prefrontal damage. often will inappropriate behavior
hard time suppressing behaviors, et cetera. third eye center seat
consciousness intention something makes sense generally
know neuroscience neurology, something think
especially important goes beyond anything ancient traditions
pineals birds snakes pits top head, is.
brain itself, meaning brain tissue, not sensory neurons.
mean that? Well, touch top hand, can feel that. want sense
heartbeat, work it, can feel that. want sense feel internally level
stomach, full, empty, hungry, acidic, ache feel
pleasant, et cetera, can sense that. sensory neurons

sounds, again, exteroception, internally, interoception, touch, et cetera.
focusing perception attention not bodily surface like body scan,
point couple centimeters inches behind forehead, essentially
bringing attentional, perceptual spotlight location no
sensation. nothing feel there. that, closing eyes
focusing that, quote, unquote, third eye center, prefrontal cortex,
quite honest, that, something else happens. happens
not thinking perceiving sensations, none there,
thoughts emotions memories sort mushroom up. better way put

perception goes there. Similarly, thinking things time.
too. perceiving things time, remembering things time,
anticipating things time future. focusing attention
one organ no sensation, is, brain, well, thoughts, feelings,
memories, feelings meaning emotional feelings, start grow prominence
awareness perception. sit
meditative practice, meditative practice close eyes
focused third eye center, focused brain opposed
bodily surface something external you, thoughts seem come waves,
can almost overwhelming. hard to, often described, just sit
back watch thoughts go many them. Actually,
best way stop thinking really focus something external focus
sensation. less thinking perceiving senses, okay? don't want
get abstract. people talk third eye center, not talking
pineal, talking prefrontal cortex, direct attention
area brain directs attention, nothing sense there.
things will become present feelings, emotions, is, thoughts
memories, will often arrive seems disorganized fashion.
reason arrive somewhat disorganized fashion because, normally,
just don't perceive things way. Normally, splitting attention,
perception, is, multiple things, sensation thoughts. put
perception thoughts, see disorganized, wandering
how, fact, random intrusive can be. Again, random intrusive.
much talked paper earlier, one asked people,
feeling happy unhappy are,
discovered people sort head lot. not
really present doing, leads statement believe,

earlier, find more, quote, unquote, head body, well,
focus exteroceptive-biased meditation build set circuits.
Whereas exteroceptively focused given moment, well,
encourage interoceptively focused meditation practice. mentioned
earlier, issue long practice. lot different data
these, practices covered podcast
guests, instance, highlighted 13-minute meditation Dr. Wendy Suzuki
New York University's laboratory popularized, popularized
wonderful paper will provide link shows daily 13-minute
meditation, traditional third eye, interoceptively biased, focus
breathing, focus location directly behind one's forehead both,
meditation done daily eight weeks, maybe shorter, study, eight
weeks, greatly improved mood, improved ability sleep, improved cognitive ability


focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day
meditation. However, trying establish long meditate, ask
couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne
data covered "Altered Traits." also borne recent studies
come since book published. Consistency key, ask
can consistently, also don't necessarily burden always
amount duration meditation. earlier, decided going
parse fine slice meditation practice, indeed that.
talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection

traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,

dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading

process nervous system, meaning brain connections

conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum

Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,

thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount

actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent

Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,

typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,

people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought

took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast

useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within

also can lead to, referred earlier, neuroplasticity, changes
brain circuits underlie default mode network lead called
trait changes. want clear not first make state versus
trait distinction. distinction raised really wonderful book. fact,
can't recommend book highly enough. book "Altered Traits: Science Reveals
Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body." book Daniel
Goleman Richard Davidson who've done terrific work many writings many
TED Talks, et cetera, meditation. say circa 2016, 2017, book
really captured believe essential elements science
meditation lot history well. Today, focusing much
covered book also lot things happened, excuse me, since 2017.
fact, papers going talk papers published
2017. But, again, wonderful book clearly distinguish
state changes trait changes, trait changes long-lasting
ones. read book literature follows is, again, sit
meditate, going effective interoceptive, exteroceptive
bias assessment. Ask whether not head outside
head, will, meditation practice runs counter

focused going around you, pushes internally.
Now, think people familiar interoceptive-biased meditation.
Again, setting timer. Maybe don't even set timer, just sit
lie down, close eyes, focus third eye center behind forehead
focus breathing bodily sensations. typical often discussed.

improvement process. Think ascending staircase refocusing. Every
time refocus, going one level, another stair, another stair, another
stair, think will move away kind judgmental process thinking,
"Ugh, like, can't focus anything." Pretty soon, notice refocusing
process will happen quickly don't even perceive it. And, again,
something borne neuroimaging data. lot people think can


focus laser precision, actually, better refocusing
quickly consistently time. classic study experienced
meditators done Japan people varying levels
meditation ability, never meditated, others really expert
meditators many hundreds not thousands hours meditation belt,
people listen 20 tones repeated over, tone,
found expert meditators really focus, brain
imaging, really focus 20 tones, whereas people kind attenuate
called habituate tone 10th 11th tone, mind really
going something else. Now, wonderful, really just tells us expert
meditators better focus. turns modern neuroimaging studies

earlier, mentioned interoceptive-biased exteroceptive-biased meditation
three minutes. say three minutes? Well, three minutes seems like
reasonable number people consistently, know, day.
fact, studies one-minute meditations three-minute meditations
10 60. laboratory studying 5-minute-a-day meditation,
clearly benefits, think also clear three minutes, many benefits
starting arrive. not pointing one particular data point here,
clear forcing oneself direct one's perception, is, attention,
internal state something external immensely beneficial
consistently is, again, especially beneficial focusing attention
portion experience, either internal external you, not one
default moment. people taken extreme say
that, know, can even just move day, every while,
just one breath meditation. honest, look whole data,
seems doesn't really matter order derive benefits meditation


practice. Now, big fan newer meditation apps there.
One particular using actually started using dad
big fan now fairly long meditations. 10 20
minutes least every day often every day, convinced check
Waking app Sam Harris put out. looked it, think sits
behind paywall, can access much least trial try without
get behind paywall. not sponsor podcast,
mention, decided use Waking app. think terrific, think one
reasons terrific Sam includes short descriptions meditation
specific meditation can just prior meditation.
meditations can quite brief. minute long, two minutes long,
longer even quite bit longer. app, think, includes variety
meditations really encompasses huge range possibilities possible
meditation, that, least experience Waking app, led
consistent meditation practice. And, course, love get Sam
podcast guest talk sort underpinnings Waking
app views everything meditation to, know big discussion
free will consciousness, deep somewhat abstract
discussions. really hope get Sam podcast time not far now.
Meanwhile, never met person, absolutely love Waking app, Sam,
know father well, know many already use it.

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms
art will picture face eyes will closed sometimes open,
there'll literally third eye, like cyclops eye middle forehead.
proposed many thousands years be, quote, unquote, seat

actually turns prefrontal cortex, know lesion studies
stimulation studies, remove brain area, people become reflexive.
not thinking intentionally, don't become deliberate. fact, kind


eerie result, inactivate, turn off prefrontal cortex give
somebody opportunity play shooting game, instance, accuracy goes
roof. become essentially like machine. see stimulus,
shoot it, see stimulus, shoot it. accuracy exceptional,

highly effective motor, say sensory motor machine, assessment
judgment right wrong completely disappears. also true
people prefrontal damage. often will inappropriate behavior
hard time suppressing behaviors, et cetera. third eye center seat
consciousness intention something makes sense generally
know neuroscience neurology, something think
especially important goes beyond anything ancient traditions
pineals birds snakes pits top head, is.
brain itself, meaning brain tissue, not sensory neurons.
mean that? Well, touch top hand, can feel that. want sense
heartbeat, work it, can feel that. want sense feel internally level
stomach, full, empty, hungry, acidic, ache feel
pleasant, et cetera, can sense that. sensory neurons

focusing perception attention not bodily surface like body scan,
point couple centimeters inches behind forehead, essentially
bringing attentional, perceptual spotlight location no
sensation. nothing feel there. that, closing eyes
focusing that, quote, unquote, third eye center, prefrontal cortex,
quite honest, that, something else happens. happens
not thinking perceiving sensations, none there,

too. perceiving things time, remembering things time,
anticipating things time future. focusing attention

memories, feelings meaning emotional feelings, start grow prominence
awareness perception. sit
meditative practice, meditative practice close eyes

bodily surface something external you, thoughts seem come waves,
can almost overwhelming. hard to, often described, just sit
back watch thoughts go many them. Actually,
best way stop thinking really focus something external focus

get abstract. people talk third eye center, not talking
pineal, talking prefrontal cortex, direct attention
area brain directs attention, nothing sense there.
things will become present feelings, emotions, is, thoughts
memories, will often arrive seems disorganized fashion.
reason arrive somewhat disorganized fashion because, normally,
just don't perceive things way. Normally, splitting attention,
perception, is, multiple things, sensation thoughts. put
perception thoughts, see disorganized, wandering
how, fact, random intrusive can be. Again, random intrusive.

Whereas exteroceptively focused given moment, well,
encourage interoceptively focused meditation practice. mentioned
earlier, issue long practice. lot different data
these, practices covered podcast
guests, instance, highlighted 13-minute meditation Dr. Wendy Suzuki
New York University's laboratory popularized, popularized
wonderful paper will provide link shows daily 13-minute
meditation, traditional third eye, interoceptively biased, focus
breathing, focus location directly behind one's forehead both,
meditation done daily eight weeks, maybe shorter, study, eight
weeks, greatly improved mood, improved ability sleep, improved cognitive ability


focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day
meditation. However, trying establish long meditate, ask
couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne
data covered "Altered Traits." also borne recent studies
come since book published. Consistency key, ask
can consistently, also don't necessarily burden always
amount duration meditation. earlier, decided going
parse fine slice meditation practice, indeed that.
talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,
exhale, controlling duration inhale, breath hold, exhale, breath hold, repeat, so-
called box breathing inhale, hold, exhale, hold
equivalent durations. number different breathing patterns, slow cyclic breathing,
box breathing, cadence three six seconds in, holding two seconds, seven
seconds out, regardless cadence breathing one uses, tendency
meditative practices slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing
deliberate fashion. essential default breathing, is,


don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces
us interoception. Why? diaphragm, muscle helps move
lungs essentially create specific cadence breathing depth breathing one
box breathing deliberately slow breathing, well, muscle resides inside
us, focus breathing, often not, aren't focused
actual air leaving nasal passages mouth, maybe little bit, typically,
forced focus just default focusing movement diaphragm
belly rising falling chest. say deliberately
focusing breathing, shift interoception. breathing specific patterns

focus breathing, shift interoception away external

one focusing interoceptive perceptions within body exteroceptive
perceptions. raises question, breathe meditation?
Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice
going best serve goals. since not episode
respiration, will one, simply want give basics respiration
can shift brain body state. that, however, want give
specific instruction, sit meditate, going
meditation walking, fine too. just say begin
meditative practice, need ask question. want
relaxed present, want alert present
exit meditation practice? want calm down, want
become alert? Simple question. can decide session session.
even switch within session. just need assess whether not
leaning interoceptively exteroceptively, also need ask yourself,
need calm want calm down, want alert end
meditation session? maybe want go state deep relaxation
exit alertness. way simple using breathwork
specific patterns breathing. general rule supported
respiration physiology aware of. oversimplifying here, oversimplifying
intentionally can simply apply tool. then, mentioned before, will
episode respiration physiology future. Essentially, inhales
longer and/or vigorous exhales, will tend alert
shift brain body towards state alertness. simply based
way neural circuits like pre-Botzinger nucleus parafacial
nucleus govern respiration physiology alertness, simply way work.
communicate brain areas release noradrenaline norepinephrine, et
cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale
longer exhale, make vigorous?" Well, simply means
drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend
exhales relative inhales, can even make active exhales. can
inhale [inhales exhales], exhale [inhales exhales]. going shift
nervous system direction calm. And, course, like stay
level alertness aka calmness two sides seesaw
continuum, like right end meditation
started, least terms levels alertness calmness, well,
just keep inhales exhales relatively balanced terms
duration. Now, introduction things like breath holds box breathing Wim Hof
breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail
before. research literature this, please let know. laboratory

collaborators. We, meaning Dr. David Spiegel expert hypnosis, again,

fact, associate chair psychiatry, world expert hypnosis,
podcast before, active research program focused issues.
much belief breathwork practice can meditative, meditation
practice can include breathing, meditative practice focuses
breathing itself, interoceptive-biased will be. Now, important
understand interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will specific effect,
make interoceptively aware. think back earlier
episode, many people, will wonderful thing something
actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice
reducing inflammatory cytokines, even improving outcomes cancer, reducing pain,
improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly
impact heart rate breathing. yanked around every experience.
instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person
environment breaking crying, yes, sad, important
sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, not get pulled
experience much lose ourselves. course areas
brain also leaning on, using metaphor, leaning
insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,
scared also going scared. push-pull
recognition distinct entities also, course, healthy desire
attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going
around you, dropping side continuum dissociated
not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep

nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding

visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also

furthest distance can see. Now, useful window

different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system

this. stop way, sit lie down, close eyes,

exteroceptive. Now, think immensely beneficial, immediate changes
experience, others called state change, is,
also can lead to, referred earlier, neuroplasticity, changes
brain circuits underlie default mode network lead called
trait changes. want clear not first make state versus
trait distinction. distinction raised really wonderful book. fact,
can't recommend book highly enough. book "Altered Traits: Science Reveals
Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body." book Daniel
Goleman Richard Davidson who've done terrific work many writings many
TED Talks, et cetera, meditation. say circa 2016, 2017, book
really captured believe essential elements science
meditation lot history well. Today, focusing much
covered book also lot things happened, excuse me, since 2017.
fact, papers going talk papers published
2017. But, again, wonderful book clearly distinguish
state changes trait changes, trait changes long-lasting
ones. read book literature follows is, again, sit
meditate, going effective interoceptive, exteroceptive
bias assessment. Ask whether not head outside
head, will, meditation practice runs counter

focused going around you, pushes internally.
Now, think people familiar interoceptive-biased meditation.
Again, setting timer. Maybe don't even set timer, just sit
lie down, close eyes, focus third eye center behind forehead

Exteroceptive based meditations, pick focal point outside beyond confines

improvement process. Think ascending staircase refocusing. Every
time refocus, going one level, another stair, another stair, another
stair, think will move away kind judgmental process thinking,
"Ugh, like, can't focus anything." Pretty soon, notice refocusing
process will happen quickly don't even perceive it. And, again,
something borne neuroimaging data. lot people think can


focus laser precision, actually, better refocusing
quickly consistently time. classic study experienced
meditators done Japan people varying levels
meditation ability, never meditated, others really expert
meditators many hundreds not thousands hours meditation belt,
people listen 20 tones repeated over, tone,
found expert meditators really focus, brain
imaging, really focus 20 tones, whereas people kind attenuate
called habituate tone 10th 11th tone, mind really
going something else. Now, wonderful, really just tells us expert
meditators better focus. turns modern neuroimaging studies

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms

Whereas exteroceptively focused given moment, well,
encourage interoceptively focused meditation practice. mentioned
earlier, issue long practice. lot different data
these, practices covered podcast
guests, instance, highlighted 13-minute meditation Dr. Wendy Suzuki
New York University's laboratory popularized, popularized
wonderful paper will provide link shows daily 13-minute
meditation, traditional third eye, interoceptively biased, focus
breathing, focus location directly behind one's forehead both,
meditation done daily eight weeks, maybe shorter, study, eight
weeks, greatly improved mood, improved ability sleep, improved cognitive ability


focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day
meditation. However, trying establish long meditate, ask
couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne
data covered "Altered Traits." also borne recent studies
come since book published. Consistency key, ask

talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,
exhale, controlling duration inhale, breath hold, exhale, breath hold, repeat, so-
called box breathing inhale, hold, exhale, hold

box breathing, cadence three six seconds in, holding two seconds, seven
seconds out, regardless cadence breathing one uses, tendency
meditative practices slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing
deliberate fashion. essential default breathing, is,


don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces
us interoception. Why? diaphragm, muscle helps move
lungs essentially create specific cadence breathing depth breathing one
box breathing deliberately slow breathing, well, muscle resides inside

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general

cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous

drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.

exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],

going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern

make interoceptively aware. think back earlier

actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation

improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD

basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative

focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection

traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,

continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within

conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin

continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time

also can lead to, referred earlier, neuroplasticity, changes
brain circuits underlie default mode network lead called

can't recommend book highly enough. book "Altered Traits: Science Reveals

"Ugh, like, can't focus anything." Pretty soon, notice refocusing

something borne neuroimaging data. lot people think can

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms
art will picture face eyes will closed sometimes open,
there'll literally third eye, like cyclops eye middle forehead.
proposed many thousands years be, quote, unquote, seat

actually turns prefrontal cortex, know lesion studies
stimulation studies, remove brain area, people become reflexive.
not thinking intentionally, don't become deliberate. fact, kind


eerie result, inactivate, turn off prefrontal cortex give
somebody opportunity play shooting game, instance, accuracy goes

shoot it, see stimulus, shoot it. accuracy exceptional,

judgment right wrong completely disappears. also true
people prefrontal damage. often will inappropriate behavior
hard time suppressing behaviors, et cetera. third eye center seat
consciousness intention something makes sense generally
know neuroscience neurology, something think
especially important goes beyond anything ancient traditions
pineals birds snakes pits top head, is.
brain itself, meaning brain tissue, not sensory neurons.
mean that? Well, touch top hand, can feel that. want sense
heartbeat, work it, can feel that. want sense feel internally level
stomach, full, empty, hungry, acidic, ache feel
pleasant, et cetera, can sense that. sensory neurons
skin body, et cetera. also sensory neurons eyes let us
perceive things externally. no sensory neurons brain. one
reasons can remove skull brain surgery somebody wide

brain no feeling. emotions, no feeling. normally,
perceiving paying attention sensing, either externally, sight
sounds, again, exteroception, internally, interoception, touch, et cetera.
focusing perception attention not bodily surface like body scan,
point couple centimeters inches behind forehead, essentially
bringing attentional, perceptual spotlight location no
sensation. nothing feel there. that, closing eyes
focusing that, quote, unquote, third eye center, prefrontal cortex,
quite honest, that, something else happens. happens
not thinking perceiving sensations, none there,
thoughts emotions memories sort mushroom up. better way put

too. perceiving things time, remembering things time,
anticipating things time future. focusing attention
one organ no sensation, is, brain, well, thoughts, feelings,
memories, feelings meaning emotional feelings, start grow prominence
awareness perception. sit
meditative practice, meditative practice close eyes
focused third eye center, focused brain opposed
bodily surface something external you, thoughts seem come waves,
can almost overwhelming. hard to, often described, just sit
back watch thoughts go many them. Actually,
best way stop thinking really focus something external focus
sensation. less thinking perceiving senses, okay? don't want
get abstract. people talk third eye center, not talking
pineal, talking prefrontal cortex, direct attention

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient

breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,

meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.

significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get

encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales

gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation

focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical

instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also

instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience

practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.

thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense

meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki

measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control

And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding

meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing

typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not

reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast

yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding

useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system

also can lead to, referred earlier, neuroplasticity, changes
brain circuits underlie default mode network lead called
trait changes. want clear not first make state versus

can't recommend book highly enough. book "Altered Traits: Science Reveals
Meditation Changes Mind, Brain, Body." book Daniel

Now, think people familiar interoceptive-biased meditation.
Again, setting timer. Maybe don't even set timer, just sit

improvement process. Think ascending staircase refocusing. Every
time refocus, going one level, another stair, another stair, another

"Ugh, like, can't focus anything." Pretty soon, notice refocusing
process will happen quickly don't even perceive it. And, again,
something borne neuroimaging data. lot people think can


focus laser precision, actually, better refocusing
quickly consistently time. classic study experienced

reasonable number people consistently, know, day.
fact, studies one-minute meditations three-minute meditations

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms
art will picture face eyes will closed sometimes open,
there'll literally third eye, like cyclops eye middle forehead.
proposed many thousands years be, quote, unquote, seat

actually turns prefrontal cortex, know lesion studies
stimulation studies, remove brain area, people become reflexive.
not thinking intentionally, don't become deliberate. fact, kind


eerie result, inactivate, turn off prefrontal cortex give
somebody opportunity play shooting game, instance, accuracy goes
roof. become essentially like machine. see stimulus,
shoot it, see stimulus, shoot it. accuracy exceptional,
ability distinguish enemy friend completely disappears. become
highly effective motor, say sensory motor machine, assessment
judgment right wrong completely disappears. also true
people prefrontal damage. often will inappropriate behavior
hard time suppressing behaviors, et cetera. third eye center seat
consciousness intention something makes sense generally
know neuroscience neurology, something think
especially important goes beyond anything ancient traditions
pineals birds snakes pits top head, is.
brain itself, meaning brain tissue, not sensory neurons.
mean that? Well, touch top hand, can feel that. want sense
heartbeat, work it, can feel that. want sense feel internally level

focusing perception attention not bodily surface like body scan,
point couple centimeters inches behind forehead, essentially
bringing attentional, perceptual spotlight location no
sensation. nothing feel there. that, closing eyes
focusing that, quote, unquote, third eye center, prefrontal cortex,
quite honest, that, something else happens. happens

too. perceiving things time, remembering things time,
anticipating things time future. focusing attention

awareness perception. sit
meditative practice, meditative practice close eyes
focused third eye center, focused brain opposed
bodily surface something external you, thoughts seem come waves,
can almost overwhelming. hard to, often described, just sit
back watch thoughts go many them. Actually,
best way stop thinking really focus something external focus
sensation. less thinking perceiving senses, okay? don't want
get abstract. people talk third eye center, not talking
pineal, talking prefrontal cortex, direct attention
area brain directs attention, nothing sense there.
things will become present feelings, emotions, is, thoughts
memories, will often arrive seems disorganized fashion.
reason arrive somewhat disorganized fashion because, normally,
just don't perceive things way. Normally, splitting attention,
perception, is, multiple things, sensation thoughts. put
perception thoughts, see disorganized, wandering
how, fact, random intrusive can be. Again, random intrusive.
much talked paper earlier, one asked people,

Whereas exteroceptively focused given moment, well,
encourage interoceptively focused meditation practice. mentioned
earlier, issue long practice. lot different data
these, practices covered podcast
guests, instance, highlighted 13-minute meditation Dr. Wendy Suzuki
New York University's laboratory popularized, popularized
wonderful paper will provide link shows daily 13-minute
meditation, traditional third eye, interoceptively biased, focus
breathing, focus location directly behind one's forehead both,
meditation done daily eight weeks, maybe shorter, study, eight
weeks, greatly improved mood, improved ability sleep, improved cognitive ability


focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day
meditation. However, trying establish long meditate, ask
couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne
data covered "Altered Traits." also borne recent studies
come since book published. Consistency key, ask
can consistently, also don't necessarily burden always
amount duration meditation. earlier, decided going
parse fine slice meditation practice, indeed that.
talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,
exhale, controlling duration inhale, breath hold, exhale, breath hold, repeat, so-
called box breathing inhale, hold, exhale, hold
equivalent durations. number different breathing patterns, slow cyclic breathing,
box breathing, cadence three six seconds in, holding two seconds, seven
seconds out, regardless cadence breathing one uses, tendency
meditative practices slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing
deliberate fashion. essential default breathing, is,


don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces
us interoception. Why? diaphragm, muscle helps move
lungs essentially create specific cadence breathing depth breathing one
box breathing deliberately slow breathing, well, muscle resides inside
us, focus breathing, often not, aren't focused
actual air leaving nasal passages mouth, maybe little bit, typically,
forced focus just default focusing movement diaphragm
belly rising falling chest. say deliberately
focusing breathing, shift interoception. breathing specific patterns

focus breathing, shift interoception away external

one focusing interoceptive perceptions within body exteroceptive
perceptions. raises question, breathe meditation?
Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice
going best serve goals. since not episode
respiration, will one, simply want give basics respiration
can shift brain body state. that, however, want give
specific instruction, sit meditate, going
meditation walking, fine too. just say begin
meditative practice, need ask question. want
relaxed present, want alert present
exit meditation practice? want calm down, want
become alert? Simple question. can decide session session.
even switch within session. just need assess whether not
leaning interoceptively exteroceptively, also need ask yourself,
need calm want calm down, want alert end
meditation session? maybe want go state deep relaxation
exit alertness. way simple using breathwork
specific patterns breathing. general rule supported
respiration physiology aware of. oversimplifying here, oversimplifying
intentionally can simply apply tool. then, mentioned before, will
episode respiration physiology future. Essentially, inhales
longer and/or vigorous exhales, will tend alert
shift brain body towards state alertness. simply based
way neural circuits like pre-Botzinger nucleus parafacial
nucleus govern respiration physiology alertness, simply way work.
communicate brain areas release noradrenaline norepinephrine, et
cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale
longer exhale, make vigorous?" Well, simply means
drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend
exhales relative inhales, can even make active exhales. can
inhale [inhales exhales], exhale [inhales exhales]. going shift
nervous system direction calm. And, course, like stay
level alertness aka calmness two sides seesaw
continuum, like right end meditation
started, least terms levels alertness calmness, well,
just keep inhales exhales relatively balanced terms
duration. Now, introduction things like breath holds box breathing Wim Hof
breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail
before. research literature this, please let know. laboratory
working extensively. always looking new colleagues
collaborators. We, meaning Dr. David Spiegel expert hypnosis, again,

fact, associate chair psychiatry, world expert hypnosis,
podcast before, active research program focused issues.
much belief breathwork practice can meditative, meditation
practice can include breathing, meditative practice focuses
breathing itself, interoceptive-biased will be. Now, important
understand interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will specific effect,
make interoceptively aware. think back earlier
episode, many people, will wonderful thing something
actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can
beneficial.



01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice
reducing inflammatory cytokines, even improving outcomes cancer, reducing pain,
improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly
impact heart rate breathing. yanked around every experience.
instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person
environment breaking crying, yes, sad, important
sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, not get pulled
experience much lose ourselves. course areas
brain also leaning on, using metaphor, leaning
insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,
scared also going scared. push-pull
recognition distinct entities also, course, healthy desire
attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going
around you, dropping side continuum dissociated
not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people

episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening

mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts

Exteroceptive based meditations, pick focal point outside beyond confines

many people well, one key elements meditative practice, whether
not interoceptively focused exteroceptively focused, really
refocusing practice. number times yank back

wanders bring back, actually effective practice is. Again,
can just focus one location laser precision mind never darts away
don't bring back, well, no neuroplasticity, nothing

perfectly. somebody tries meditation find mind
just wanders, just remember every time scruff pull back
focusing location externally focus back breath third eye
center, one aren't just opportunities better, essential
improvement process. Think ascending staircase refocusing. Every
time refocus, going one level, another stair, another stair, another
stair, think will move away kind judgmental process thinking,
"Ugh, like, can't focus anything." Pretty soon, notice refocusing
process will happen quickly don't even perceive it. And, again,
something borne neuroimaging data. lot people think can


focus laser precision, actually, better refocusing
quickly consistently time. classic study experienced
meditators done Japan people varying levels
meditation ability, never meditated, others really expert

big fan now fairly long meditations. 10 20
minutes least every day often every day, convinced check
Waking app Sam Harris put out. looked it, think sits
behind paywall, can access much least trial try without
get behind paywall. not sponsor podcast,
mention, decided use Waking app. think terrific, think one
reasons terrific Sam includes short descriptions meditation
specific meditation can just prior meditation.
meditations can quite brief. minute long, two minutes long,
longer even quite bit longer. app, think, includes variety
meditations really encompasses huge range possibilities possible
meditation, that, least experience Waking app, led
consistent meditation practice. And, course, love get Sam
podcast guest talk sort underpinnings Waking
app views everything meditation to, know big discussion
free will consciousness, deep somewhat abstract
discussions. really hope get Sam podcast time not far now.
Meanwhile, never met person, absolutely love Waking app, Sam,
know father well, know many already use it.

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms

there'll literally third eye, like cyclops eye middle forehead.

earlier, issue long practice. lot different data
these, practices covered podcast
guests, instance, highlighted 13-minute meditation Dr. Wendy Suzuki
New York University's laboratory popularized, popularized
wonderful paper will provide link shows daily 13-minute
meditation, traditional third eye, interoceptively biased, focus
breathing, focus location directly behind one's forehead both,
meditation done daily eight weeks, maybe shorter, study, eight
weeks, greatly improved mood, improved ability sleep, improved cognitive ability


focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day
meditation. However, trying establish long meditate, ask
couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne
data covered "Altered Traits." also borne recent studies
come since book published. Consistency key, ask

talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,
exhale, controlling duration inhale, breath hold, exhale, breath hold, repeat, so-
called box breathing inhale, hold, exhale, hold
equivalent durations. number different breathing patterns, slow cyclic breathing,
box breathing, cadence three six seconds in, holding two seconds, seven
seconds out, regardless cadence breathing one uses, tendency
meditative practices slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing
deliberate fashion. essential default breathing, is,


don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces
us interoception. Why? diaphragm, muscle helps move
lungs essentially create specific cadence breathing depth breathing one
box breathing deliberately slow breathing, well, muscle resides inside
us, focus breathing, often not, aren't focused
actual air leaving nasal passages mouth, maybe little bit, typically,
forced focus just default focusing movement diaphragm

one focusing interoceptive perceptions within body exteroceptive

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice
going best serve goals. since not episode

can shift brain body state. that, however, want give

become alert? Simple question. can decide session session.
even switch within session. just need assess whether not
leaning interoceptively exteroceptively, also need ask yourself,
need calm want calm down, want alert end
meditation session? maybe want go state deep relaxation
exit alertness. way simple using breathwork
specific patterns breathing. general rule supported
respiration physiology aware of. oversimplifying here, oversimplifying
intentionally can simply apply tool. then, mentioned before, will

communicate brain areas release noradrenaline norepinephrine, et
cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale
longer exhale, make vigorous?" Well, simply means
drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend
exhales relative inhales, can even make active exhales. can
inhale [inhales exhales], exhale [inhales exhales]. going shift
nervous system direction calm. And, course, like stay
level alertness aka calmness two sides seesaw
continuum, like right end meditation
started, least terms levels alertness calmness, well,
just keep inhales exhales relatively balanced terms
duration. Now, introduction things like breath holds box breathing Wim Hof
breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail

much belief breathwork practice can meditative, meditation

understand interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will specific effect,
make interoceptively aware. think back earlier

actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice

improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly

instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person

insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,

attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk

can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands

ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form

course, states all, frankly, go time time

right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life

not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing

practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating

distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent

memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find

Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra

insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding

useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms
art will picture face eyes will closed sometimes open,
there'll literally third eye, like cyclops eye middle forehead.
proposed many thousands years be, quote, unquote, seat

actually turns prefrontal cortex, know lesion studies
stimulation studies, remove brain area, people become reflexive.
not thinking intentionally, don't become deliberate. fact, kind


eerie result, inactivate, turn off prefrontal cortex give
somebody opportunity play shooting game, instance, accuracy goes

shoot it, see stimulus, shoot it. accuracy exceptional,

especially important goes beyond anything ancient traditions

brain itself, meaning brain tissue, not sensory neurons.
mean that? Well, touch top hand, can feel that. want sense

focusing perception attention not bodily surface like body scan,
point couple centimeters inches behind forehead, essentially
bringing attentional, perceptual spotlight location no
sensation. nothing feel there. that, closing eyes
focusing that, quote, unquote, third eye center, prefrontal cortex,
quite honest, that, something else happens. happens

too. perceiving things time, remembering things time,
anticipating things time future. focusing attention

memories, feelings meaning emotional feelings, start grow prominence
awareness perception. sit
meditative practice, meditative practice close eyes
focused third eye center, focused brain opposed
bodily surface something external you, thoughts seem come waves,
can almost overwhelming. hard to, often described, just sit
back watch thoughts go many them. Actually,
best way stop thinking really focus something external focus
sensation. less thinking perceiving senses, okay? don't want
get abstract. people talk third eye center, not talking
pineal, talking prefrontal cortex, direct attention
area brain directs attention, nothing sense there.
things will become present feelings, emotions, is, thoughts
memories, will often arrive seems disorganized fashion.
reason arrive somewhat disorganized fashion because, normally,
just don't perceive things way. Normally, splitting attention,
perception, is, multiple things, sensation thoughts. put
perception thoughts, see disorganized, wandering
how, fact, random intrusive can be. Again, random intrusive.
much talked paper earlier, one asked people,

focus exteroceptive-biased meditation build set circuits.
Whereas exteroceptively focused given moment, well,
encourage interoceptively focused meditation practice. mentioned
earlier, issue long practice. lot different data
these, practices covered podcast
guests, instance, highlighted 13-minute meditation Dr. Wendy Suzuki
New York University's laboratory popularized, popularized
wonderful paper will provide link shows daily 13-minute
meditation, traditional third eye, interoceptively biased, focus
breathing, focus location directly behind one's forehead both,
meditation done daily eight weeks, maybe shorter, study, eight
weeks, greatly improved mood, improved ability sleep, improved cognitive ability


focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day
meditation. However, trying establish long meditate, ask
couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne
data covered "Altered Traits." also borne recent studies
come since book published. Consistency key, ask
can consistently, also don't necessarily burden always
amount duration meditation. earlier, decided going
parse fine slice meditation practice, indeed that.
talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,

called box breathing inhale, hold, exhale, hold

box breathing, cadence three six seconds in, holding two seconds, seven
seconds out, regardless cadence breathing one uses, tendency
meditative practices slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing
deliberate fashion. essential default breathing, is,


don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces

lungs essentially create specific cadence breathing depth breathing one
box breathing deliberately slow breathing, well, muscle resides inside

one focusing interoceptive perceptions within body exteroceptive

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice
going best serve goals. since not episode

can shift brain body state. that, however, want give

exit meditation practice? want calm down, want
become alert? Simple question. can decide session session.
even switch within session. just need assess whether not
leaning interoceptively exteroceptively, also need ask yourself,
need calm want calm down, want alert end
meditation session? maybe want go state deep relaxation
exit alertness. way simple using breathwork
specific patterns breathing. general rule supported
respiration physiology aware of. oversimplifying here, oversimplifying
intentionally can simply apply tool. then, mentioned before, will

cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale
longer exhale, make vigorous?" Well, simply means
drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail
before. research literature this, please let know. laboratory
working extensively. always looking new colleagues
collaborators. We, meaning Dr. David Spiegel expert hypnosis, again,
guest Huberman Lab podcast colleague Stanford Psychiatry.
fact, associate chair psychiatry, world expert hypnosis,
podcast before, active research program focused issues.
much belief breathwork practice can meditative, meditation
practice can include breathing, meditative practice focuses
breathing itself, interoceptive-biased will be. Now, important
understand interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will specific effect,
make interoceptively aware. think back earlier
episode, many people, will wonderful thing something
actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can
beneficial.



01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice
reducing inflammatory cytokines, even improving outcomes cancer, reducing pain,
improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly
impact heart rate breathing. yanked around every experience.
instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person
environment breaking crying, yes, sad, important
sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, not get pulled
experience much lose ourselves. course areas
brain also leaning on, using metaphor, leaning
insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,
scared also going scared. push-pull
recognition distinct entities also, course, healthy desire
attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going
around you, dropping side continuum dissociated
not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people

covered lot information, like think given key
decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want

NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form

third eye meditation, relaxing, yet focus refocus
practice, whereas something like yoga nidra NSDR going along
lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing

episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get
hypnosis now, just understand hypnosis distinct breathwork, yoga
nidra, NSDR, meditation even though includes
components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual
attention outward inward go hypnosis, involves breathing

Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
reducing pain number things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis really


great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts

haven't tried already, really encourage check out. want talk just
briefly third eye center business turns pretty interesting.
third eye actually name given another neural structure,
say structure not strictly neural, pineal gland,
interesting history. promise not taking off tangent isn't relevant
meditation. brain course, sides brain, tend
mirror symmetric representations things. mean that?
Well, prefrontal cortex right, prefrontal cortex left,
actually slightly different things. Language sometimes lateralized one
side, general, every structure one side brain,


structure opposite side brain. one clear exception that,
pineal gland. pineal gland gland makes melatonin, which,
night gets dark, secretes melatonin, melatonin makes sleepy,
helps fall asleep not stay asleep. Descartes, right, philosopher Descartes
asserted pineal seat soul one structure
brain saw not sides brain, one
middle. Now, don't know seat soul not, not position make
assessments like that. know pineal? pineal,
mentioned, involved releasing melatonin, things well,
also considered third eye couple reasons. One responds light,
although, humans, not directly. birds lizards snakes, actually either
thin skull, or, believe not, two holes top skull allow light
go directly in. look head snake, light can go directly brain
holes activate pineal suppress melatonin control
wakefulness, sleep rhythms. birds, don't holes skull,
thin skulls. And, believe not, light can penetrate thinness skull
many birds communicates information time day even time year,
translating hormonal signals melatonin release pineal.
pineal called third eye light-sensitive organ inside
brain. humans, pineal sits deep, deep, deep surface, light cannot get
there. fact, light can get brain, unless part specific experiment
intention neurosurgery something sort,
got serious issues happening. pineal sits deep, deep, deep near
called fourth ventricle, absolutely not see light directly. idea
pineal third eye humans not true. just isn't true. anytime someone
says, "Oh, pineal third eye." not third eye center people
referring talk meditation. Now, see number different forms

focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day

couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne

talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,
exhale, controlling duration inhale, breath hold, exhale, breath hold, repeat, so-
called box breathing inhale, hold, exhale, hold

box breathing, cadence three six seconds in, holding two seconds, seven
seconds out, regardless cadence breathing one uses, tendency
meditative practices slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing
deliberate fashion. essential default breathing, is,


don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces

lungs essentially create specific cadence breathing depth breathing one
box breathing deliberately slow breathing, well, muscle resides inside

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice

cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale
longer exhale, make vigorous?" Well, simply means
drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend
exhales relative inhales, can even make active exhales. can
inhale [inhales exhales], exhale [inhales exhales]. going shift
nervous system direction calm. And, course, like stay
level alertness aka calmness two sides seesaw
continuum, like right end meditation
started, least terms levels alertness calmness, well,
just keep inhales exhales relatively balanced terms
duration. Now, introduction things like breath holds box breathing Wim Hof
breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail

make interoceptively aware. think back earlier

actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice

improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception

something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much

instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience

take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked

continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say

know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?

know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will

interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki

trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,

typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases

reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding

furthest distance can see. Now, useful window

different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time

key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually

dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive

these, practices covered podcast
guests, instance, highlighted 13-minute meditation Dr. Wendy Suzuki
New York University's laboratory popularized, popularized
wonderful paper will provide link shows daily 13-minute
meditation, traditional third eye, interoceptively biased, focus
breathing, focus location directly behind one's forehead both,

weeks, greatly improved mood, improved ability sleep, improved cognitive ability


focus, memory, huge number metrics looked specifically.
terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day
meditation. However, trying establish long meditate, ask
couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,
exhale, controlling duration inhale, breath hold, exhale, breath hold, repeat, so-
called box breathing inhale, hold, exhale, hold

box breathing, cadence three six seconds in, holding two seconds, seven
seconds out, regardless cadence breathing one uses, tendency
meditative practices slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing
deliberate fashion. essential default breathing, is,


don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces
us interoception. Why? diaphragm, muscle helps move
lungs essentially create specific cadence breathing depth breathing one
box breathing deliberately slow breathing, well, muscle resides inside

one focusing interoceptive perceptions within body exteroceptive
perceptions. raises question, breathe meditation?
Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice
going best serve goals. since not episode
respiration, will one, simply want give basics respiration
can shift brain body state. that, however, want give
specific instruction, sit meditate, going
meditation walking, fine too. just say begin
meditative practice, need ask question. want
relaxed present, want alert present
exit meditation practice? want calm down, want
become alert? Simple question. can decide session session.
even switch within session. just need assess whether not
leaning interoceptively exteroceptively, also need ask yourself,
need calm want calm down, want alert end
meditation session? maybe want go state deep relaxation
exit alertness. way simple using breathwork
specific patterns breathing. general rule supported
respiration physiology aware of. oversimplifying here, oversimplifying
intentionally can simply apply tool. then, mentioned before, will
episode respiration physiology future. Essentially, inhales
longer and/or vigorous exhales, will tend alert
shift brain body towards state alertness. simply based
way neural circuits like pre-Botzinger nucleus parafacial
nucleus govern respiration physiology alertness, simply way work.
communicate brain areas release noradrenaline norepinephrine, et
cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale
longer exhale, make vigorous?" Well, simply means
drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend
exhales relative inhales, can even make active exhales. can
inhale [inhales exhales], exhale [inhales exhales]. going shift
nervous system direction calm. And, course, like stay
level alertness aka calmness two sides seesaw
continuum, like right end meditation
started, least terms levels alertness calmness, well,
just keep inhales exhales relatively balanced terms
duration. Now, introduction things like breath holds box breathing Wim Hof
breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail
before. research literature this, please let know. laboratory

much belief breathwork practice can meditative, meditation
practice can include breathing, meditative practice focuses
breathing itself, interoceptive-biased will be. Now, important
understand interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will specific effect,
make interoceptively aware. think back earlier
episode, many people, will wonderful thing something
actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can
beneficial.



01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits

focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly
impact heart rate breathing. yanked around every experience.
instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person
environment breaking crying, yes, sad, important
sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, not get pulled
experience much lose ourselves. course areas
brain also leaning on, using metaphor, leaning
insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,
scared also going scared. push-pull
recognition distinct entities also, course, healthy desire
attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going
around you, dropping side continuum dissociated
not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people
position action-oriented focused, et cetera, come
yoga nidra, certainly useful practice. form meditation, call
meditation-ish, yoga nidra NSDR not typically people think
talk meditation. course, episode meditation. reason
bring yoga nidra NSDR many people meditate enhance sleep
ability reduce total amount sleep need. appears meditation
probably not ideal comparison yoga nidra NSDR, meditation
excellent, not superb, adjusting default mode network toward happiness
mindful present

02:11:33 Choosing Meditative Practice; Hypnosis

placing oneself healthy model interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
covered lot information, like think given key
decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want
thing going allow feel rested tired going allow
adjust state mind not want whatever reason,
anxious exhausted, et cetera." people, say practice like


NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form
meditation. also want just remind everybody app guides meditation, also
information intention setting, Waking app Sam
Harris can immensely beneficial. certainly found beneficial. know millions
people well, encourage check out. talked
determining continuums interoception exteroception
order dictate particular type meditation practice given
moment, whether not focus vision inward eyes closed focus
vision attention outward key component, whether not
cyclic breathing, will allow focus off breathing somewhat
easier non-cyclic breathing, doubling inhales exhales,
whether not breathing going natural not. And, course, need
determine whether not meditation practice designed enhance level
focus relax you. say designed enhance level focus,
doesn't necessarily mean won't relaxing. slow cadence breathing
third eye meditation, relaxing, yet focus refocus
practice, whereas something like yoga nidra NSDR going along
lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing
sleep need. previous podcasts, talked hypnosis, particularly
episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get
hypnosis now, just understand hypnosis distinct breathwork, yoga
nidra, NSDR, meditation even though includes
components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual
attention outward inward go hypnosis, involves breathing
particular kind, involves specific imagery, et cetera. hypnosis distinct
hypnosis really designed fix address specific problem, whereas meditation,
NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically not. can help fix problems
anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, generally not directed toward particular
line thinking. can be, typically not. Whereas hypnosis almost
always, especially clinical context, not stage hypnosis, clinical context
lot research show can, instance, help quitting smoking,
literally quadrupling effectiveness smoking cessation something like
Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
reducing pain number things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis really


great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,

disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially

indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling

talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,

thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's

whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not

One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard

Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,

Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought

meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice

order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,
exhale, controlling duration inhale, breath hold, exhale, breath hold, repeat, so-
called box breathing inhale, hold, exhale, hold

box breathing, cadence three six seconds in, holding two seconds, seven
seconds out, regardless cadence breathing one uses, tendency
meditative practices slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing
deliberate fashion. essential default breathing, is,


don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice
going best serve goals. since not episode

can shift brain body state. that, however, want give
specific instruction, sit meditate, going

become alert? Simple question. can decide session session.
even switch within session. just need assess whether not
leaning interoceptively exteroceptively, also need ask yourself,
need calm want calm down, want alert end
meditation session? maybe want go state deep relaxation
exit alertness. way simple using breathwork
specific patterns breathing. general rule supported
respiration physiology aware of. oversimplifying here, oversimplifying
intentionally can simply apply tool. then, mentioned before, will
episode respiration physiology future. Essentially, inhales
longer and/or vigorous exhales, will tend alert

cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale
longer exhale, make vigorous?" Well, simply means
drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend
exhales relative inhales, can even make active exhales. can
inhale [inhales exhales], exhale [inhales exhales]. going shift

level alertness aka calmness two sides seesaw
continuum, like right end meditation
started, least terms levels alertness calmness, well,
just keep inhales exhales relatively balanced terms
duration. Now, introduction things like breath holds box breathing Wim Hof
breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.

understand interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will specific effect,
make interoceptively aware. think back earlier

actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice
reducing inflammatory cytokines, even improving outcomes cancer, reducing pain,
improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly
impact heart rate breathing. yanked around every experience.
instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person
environment breaking crying, yes, sad, important
sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, not get pulled
experience much lose ourselves. course areas

insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,
scared also going scared. push-pull
recognition distinct entities also, course, healthy desire
attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,

concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness

somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay

interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find

Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language

called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice

generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding

useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within

terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown

answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice

order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice
going best serve goals. since not episode

can shift brain body state. that, however, want give
specific instruction, sit meditate, going

even switch within session. just need assess whether not
leaning interoceptively exteroceptively, also need ask yourself,
need calm want calm down, want alert end
meditation session? maybe want go state deep relaxation
exit alertness. way simple using breathwork
specific patterns breathing. general rule supported
respiration physiology aware of. oversimplifying here, oversimplifying
intentionally can simply apply tool. then, mentioned before, will
episode respiration physiology future. Essentially, inhales

cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale
longer exhale, make vigorous?" Well, simply means
drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend
exhales relative inhales, can even make active exhales. can

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail

make interoceptively aware. think back earlier

actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice

improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD

basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative

focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum

interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going

people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode

happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come

Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate

also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,

interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three

different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer

the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much

terrific one. may asking yourself, need full 13 minutes?
get away five minutes three minutes? Well, laboratory shown
benefits stress reduction, improvement sleep, et cetera, five-minute-a-day
meditation. However, trying establish long meditate, ask
couple questions. First all, practice can
consistently? consistently, doesn't necessarily mean every day.
answer question consistency honestly, find can one
meditation session per week, well, encourage go little bit longer,
maybe 10 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding
going refocus repeatedly throughout meditation regardless whether
not focusing internal perceptions external perceptions. If, however, can
set aside 5 10 15 minutes per day can meditate every day, well,
think bit flexibility terms long meditate. Maybe three
minutes one day, one minute next day, 10 minutes next, forth.
Just like exercise, key component consistency, borne

talked interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,

01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception

talking place perception focus. Another
key component meditation pattern breathing embrace. fact,
pattern breathing embrace meditation practice can
form meditation. mean that? Well, days, hear lot
breathwork. Breathwork really grown popularity last 5, 10 years,
number reasons that. First all, think need credit Wim Hof, can
call him, think appropriately, Great Wim Hof? know, certainly
people Wim deliberate breathwork talking deliberate
breathwork, really 2015 Wim Hof started grow


recognition popularity particular style breathing, which, laboratory,
call cyclic hyperventilation. know names come ancient
traditions. named it, people named him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
don't know, Dutchman known hold many world records deliberate
cold exposure, including swimming icebergs, longest period time buried ice
neck, et cetera, also expert use breathing particular ways
order manage maneuver challenges. started speaking
different patterns breathwork, particular, use cyclic hyperventilation,
deep, deliberate breathing, big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales
[inhales exhales] exhales. laboratory, again, call cyclic
hyperventilation. clear studies done Wim specifically
general population well lab labs pattern cyclic
hyperventilation, deliberately breathing deeply repetitively, typically
nose, mouth, generates lot adrenaline causes adrenaline release
brain body. It, quote, unquote, heats body. Indeed, raises body
temperature, liberation adrenaline number things shift state
brain body. That, less, Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof
breathing, people will call tummo breathing cyclic hyperventilation, not
pattern breathing typical meditations discussed, least not
research literature. Now, not say cyclic hyperventilation can't
incorporated meditation practice, Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic
hyperventilation/tummo typically considered practice, okay?
breathwork practice divorced meditation. might meditative component,
not often discussed meditation part meditation. typically,
meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, form
cyclic breathing inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, cyclic, or, cases,
doubling inhales exhaling, inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale,
exhale, controlling duration inhale, breath hold, exhale, breath hold, repeat, so-
called box breathing inhale, hold, exhale, hold
equivalent durations. number different breathing patterns, slow cyclic breathing,
box breathing, cadence three six seconds in, holding two seconds, seven
seconds out, regardless cadence breathing one uses, tendency
meditative practices slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing
deliberate fashion. essential default breathing, is,


don't pay attention long inhaling relative exhales,
don't deliberately exhale, is, normally just passively exhale actively
inhale, repeat that, normally, not thinking breathing, deliberately
inhale, motor command sent inflate lungs, passively
exhale. many breathwork practices meditation practices, actually actively
exhale well. Well, that, number things happen. First all, forces
us interoception. Why? diaphragm, muscle helps move
lungs essentially create specific cadence breathing depth breathing one
box breathing deliberately slow breathing, well, muscle resides inside
us, focus breathing, often not, aren't focused
actual air leaving nasal passages mouth, maybe little bit, typically,
forced focus just default focusing movement diaphragm
belly rising falling chest. say deliberately
focusing breathing, shift interoception. breathing specific patterns
breathing sort along ride meditation, reverse can also said,
focus breathing, shift interoception away external
events. doesn't mean can't still pay attention external events, can still
exterocept, least portion perception, attention shifts
interoception. course need breathe stay alive. breathe least
every often order stay alive, so, course, breathing part meditative
practice, just like part living activity, even sleep. first component

one focusing interoceptive perceptions within body exteroceptive
perceptions. raises question, breathe meditation?
Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice
going best serve goals. since not episode
respiration, will one, simply want give basics respiration
can shift brain body state. that, however, want give
specific instruction, sit meditate, going
meditation walking, fine too. just say begin
meditative practice, need ask question. want
relaxed present, want alert present
exit meditation practice? want calm down, want
become alert? Simple question. can decide session session.
even switch within session. just need assess whether not
leaning interoceptively exteroceptively, also need ask yourself,
need calm want calm down, want alert end
meditation session? maybe want go state deep relaxation
exit alertness. way simple using breathwork
specific patterns breathing. general rule supported
respiration physiology aware of. oversimplifying here, oversimplifying
intentionally can simply apply tool. then, mentioned before, will
episode respiration physiology future. Essentially, inhales
longer and/or vigorous exhales, will tend alert
shift brain body towards state alertness. simply based
way neural circuits like pre-Botzinger nucleus parafacial
nucleus govern respiration physiology alertness, simply way work.
communicate brain areas release noradrenaline norepinephrine, et
cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale
longer exhale, make vigorous?" Well, simply means
drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend
exhales relative inhales, can even make active exhales. can
inhale [inhales exhales], exhale [inhales exhales]. going shift
nervous system direction calm. And, course, like stay
level alertness aka calmness two sides seesaw

started, least terms levels alertness calmness, well,
just keep inhales exhales relatively balanced terms

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail
before. research literature this, please let know. laboratory

much belief breathwork practice can meditative, meditation
practice can include breathing, meditative practice focuses
breathing itself, interoceptive-biased will be. Now, important
understand interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will specific effect,
make interoceptively aware. think back earlier
episode, many people, will wonderful thing something
actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can
beneficial.



01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice
reducing inflammatory cytokines, even improving outcomes cancer, reducing pain,
improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly
impact heart rate breathing. yanked around every experience.
instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person
environment breaking crying, yes, sad, important
sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, not get pulled
experience much lose ourselves. course areas

insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,
scared also going scared. push-pull
recognition distinct entities also, course, healthy desire
attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going

not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening

mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-

thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible

continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin

bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context

raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental

Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,

thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount

actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense

meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent

Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,

typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,

people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases

reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast

Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice
going best serve goals. since not episode
respiration, will one, simply want give basics respiration
can shift brain body state. that, however, want give
specific instruction, sit meditate, going
meditation walking, fine too. just say begin
meditative practice, need ask question. want
relaxed present, want alert present
exit meditation practice? want calm down, want
become alert? Simple question. can decide session session.
even switch within session. just need assess whether not
leaning interoceptively exteroceptively, also need ask yourself,
need calm want calm down, want alert end
meditation session? maybe want go state deep relaxation
exit alertness. way simple using breathwork
specific patterns breathing. general rule supported
respiration physiology aware of. oversimplifying here, oversimplifying
intentionally can simply apply tool. then, mentioned before, will
episode respiration physiology future. Essentially, inhales
longer and/or vigorous exhales, will tend alert

cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale
longer exhale, make vigorous?" Well, simply means
drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend
exhales relative inhales, can even make active exhales. can
inhale [inhales exhales], exhale [inhales exhales]. going shift
nervous system direction calm. And, course, like stay
level alertness aka calmness two sides seesaw
continuum, like right end meditation
started, least terms levels alertness calmness, well,
just keep inhales exhales relatively balanced terms
duration. Now, introduction things like breath holds box breathing Wim Hof
breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail

much belief breathwork practice can meditative, meditation
practice can include breathing, meditative practice focuses
breathing itself, interoceptive-biased will be. Now, important
understand interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will specific effect,
make interoceptively aware. think back earlier

actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice
reducing inflammatory cytokines, even improving outcomes cancer, reducing pain,
improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly
impact heart rate breathing. yanked around every experience.
instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person
environment breaking crying, yes, sad, important
sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, not get pulled
experience much lose ourselves. course areas
brain also leaning on, using metaphor, leaning
insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,
scared also going scared. push-pull
recognition distinct entities also, course, healthy desire
attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going
around you, dropping side continuum dissociated
not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

one focusing interoceptive perceptions within body exteroceptive
perceptions. raises question, breathe meditation?
Well, is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, general
rules respiration physiology can help us access develop meditation practice
going best serve goals. since not episode
respiration, will one, simply want give basics respiration
can shift brain body state. that, however, want give
specific instruction, sit meditate, going
meditation walking, fine too. just say begin
meditative practice, need ask question. want
relaxed present, want alert present
exit meditation practice? want calm down, want
become alert? Simple question. can decide session session.
even switch within session. just need assess whether not
leaning interoceptively exteroceptively, also need ask yourself,
need calm want calm down, want alert end
meditation session? maybe want go state deep relaxation
exit alertness. way simple using breathwork
specific patterns breathing. general rule supported
respiration physiology aware of. oversimplifying here, oversimplifying
intentionally can simply apply tool. then, mentioned before, will
episode respiration physiology future. Essentially, inhales
longer and/or vigorous exhales, will tend alert
shift brain body towards state alertness. simply based
way neural circuits like pre-Botzinger nucleus parafacial
nucleus govern respiration physiology alertness, simply way work.
communicate brain areas release noradrenaline norepinephrine, et
cetera. contrast, emphasize longer duration and/or vigorous exhales
relative inhales, will tend relax more, will tend calm nervous
system. Now, might saying, "Okay, understand make inhale
longer exhale, make vigorous?" Well, simply means
drawing air lungs quickly allow exhale air.
example inhale-biased breathwork [inhales exhales] [inhales
exhales], active emphasis inhale, little bit longer


exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend
exhales relative inhales, can even make active exhales. can
inhale [inhales exhales], exhale [inhales exhales]. going shift
nervous system direction calm. And, course, like stay
level alertness aka calmness two sides seesaw
continuum, like right end meditation
started, least terms levels alertness calmness, well,
just keep inhales exhales relatively balanced terms
duration. Now, introduction things like breath holds box breathing Wim Hof
breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail
before. research literature this, please let know. laboratory
working extensively. always looking new colleagues
collaborators. We, meaning Dr. David Spiegel expert hypnosis, again,
guest Huberman Lab podcast colleague Stanford Psychiatry.
fact, associate chair psychiatry, world expert hypnosis,
podcast before, active research program focused issues.
much belief breathwork practice can meditative, meditation
practice can include breathing, meditative practice focuses
breathing itself, interoceptive-biased will be. Now, important
understand interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will specific effect,
make interoceptively aware. think back earlier
episode, many people, will wonderful thing something
actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can
beneficial.



01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice
reducing inflammatory cytokines, even improving outcomes cancer, reducing pain,
improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly
impact heart rate breathing. yanked around every experience.
instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person
environment breaking crying, yes, sad, important
sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, not get pulled
experience much lose ourselves. course areas
brain also leaning on, using metaphor, leaning
insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,
scared also going scared. push-pull
recognition distinct entities also, course, healthy desire
attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going
around you, dropping side continuum dissociated
not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.

covered lot information, like think given key
decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want
thing going allow feel rested tired going allow

anxious exhausted, et cetera." people, say practice like


NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form

lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing
sleep need. previous podcasts, talked hypnosis, particularly
episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get
hypnosis now, just understand hypnosis distinct breathwork, yoga
nidra, NSDR, meditation even though includes
components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual
attention outward inward go hypnosis, involves breathing
particular kind, involves specific imagery, et cetera. hypnosis distinct
hypnosis really designed fix address specific problem, whereas meditation,
NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically not. can help fix problems
anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, generally not directed toward particular

Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
reducing pain number things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis really


great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

exhale passive. Conversely, want relax, want extend
exhales relative inhales, can even make active exhales. can
inhale [inhales exhales], exhale [inhales exhales]. going shift
nervous system direction calm. And, course, like stay
level alertness aka calmness two sides seesaw
continuum, like right end meditation
started, least terms levels alertness calmness, well,
just keep inhales exhales relatively balanced terms

breathing, typically, 25 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales,
exhale air, hold breath 15 60 seconds, repeat on,
sometimes inhales holds. Well, whole business itself. sake
meditation, key thing understand going complicated
breathing practice, will, design, necessity, shift much attention
breathing practice, especially not cyclic, not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic
breathing inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales.
actually relies specific brain center called pre-Botzinger complex discovered
Jack Feldman UCLA. guest podcast previously. However,
doubling inhale, two inhales [inhaling], exhale [exhales],
pattern breathing laboratory studied extensively, well, relies
different brain center, parafacial nucleus. point engaging
noncyclic breathing deliberately emphasizing inhales exhales vigor
inhales exhales, et cetera, well, portion attention will
devoted making sure follow breathing practice. good
going cyclic breathing practices default, attention can drift things.
Interoceptive exteroceptive, doesn't matter, can just drift into, know,
body feels something see hear room, et cetera. focused
breathing breathing pattern noncyclic complex way
involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, so-called top-down
mechanisms prefrontal cortex, well, that, design, requires portion, often
significant portion attention devoted breathing practice itself.
mean? means breathwork can form meditation,
meditation can involve breathwork, one know deliberate
unnatural pattern breathing is, less will able focus things.


Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail

much belief breathwork practice can meditative, meditation
practice can include breathing, meditative practice focuses
breathing itself, interoceptive-biased will be. Now, important
understand interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will specific effect,
make interoceptively aware. think back earlier
episode, many people, will wonderful thing something
actively seeking seek can help people gain awareness,
instance, know, stressed not realizing till end day,
just exhausted, interoceptive awareness throughout day can

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice
reducing inflammatory cytokines, even improving outcomes cancer, reducing pain,
improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly
impact heart rate breathing. yanked around every experience.
instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person
environment breaking crying, yes, sad, important
sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, not get pulled
experience much lose ourselves. course areas
brain also leaning on, using metaphor, leaning
insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,
scared also going scared. push-pull
recognition distinct entities also, course, healthy desire
attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going
around you, dropping side continuum dissociated
not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts

Now, isn't necessarily bad thing. can actually leverage this. instance,
somebody much caught head, right, talked
earlier, moment really stuck head want get
head, well, meditation practice really focused
exteroceptive bias, really focus something external you,
encourage use natural cyclic pattern breathing inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, finding sort caught
landscape things happening around want ground yourself,
sometimes called... loose language, not scientific language. know
practice grounding, whole thing. People always writing me, "Is
grounding real thing, walking barefoot Earth magnetic fields, know,
gravitational fields?" Well, gravity's real, but, know, grounding, isn't lot
science it, frank. feel nice walk ground, however.
somebody kind feeling pulled lot moment want
bring awareness body sort calm down, well,
encourage to, yes, use deliberate, somewhat unnatural non-default pattern
breathing, which, definition, will force attend going interoceptively.
Again, not aware place discussed detail

much belief breathwork practice can meditative, meditation

breathing itself, interoceptive-biased will be. Now, important
understand interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will specific effect,
make interoceptively aware. think back earlier

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice
reducing inflammatory cytokines, even improving outcomes cancer, reducing pain,
improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly
impact heart rate breathing. yanked around every experience.
instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person
environment breaking crying, yes, sad, important
sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, not get pulled
experience much lose ourselves. course areas
brain also leaning on, using metaphor, leaning
insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,
scared also going scared. push-pull
recognition distinct entities also, course, healthy desire
attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going
around you, dropping side continuum dissociated
not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased

components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual
attention outward inward go hypnosis, involves breathing
particular kind, involves specific imagery, et cetera. hypnosis distinct
hypnosis really designed fix address specific problem, whereas meditation,
NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically not. can help fix problems
anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, generally not directed toward particular
line thinking. can be, typically not. Whereas hypnosis almost
always, especially clinical context, not stage hypnosis, clinical context
lot research show can, instance, help quitting smoking,
literally quadrupling effectiveness smoking cessation something like
Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
reducing pain number things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis really


great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma

If, however, somebody overly focused bodily sensations, well,
exteroception awareness important. brings us yet larger
theme theme think really emphasizes particular types meditative
practices going best certain people, especially people using
meditation combat certain challenges, particular, mood-based challenges sleep-
based challenges focus-based challenges. haven't listed off positive benefits
meditation yet episode, many, many, many. fact, now
tens thousands scientific studies showing, instance, known benefits
meditation enhancing sleep, known benefits regular meditation
practice enhancing focus, known benefits regular meditation practice
reducing inflammatory cytokines, even improving outcomes cancer, reducing pain,
improving mood, reducing symptoms ADHD clinically diagnosed HD
on. And, again, rather focus beautiful studies today
basically point fact meditation practice done regularly, even
brief, tremendous, even outsized benefits health even relative
drug treatments, shown. Rather focus that,
focused sorts brain body changes occur meditation
practice and, perhaps importantly, really constitutes meditation practice.
thing continuum perception. also now talking
breathing. Well, another component like raise now, say
third major component first one raised interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias continuum, second breathing, going default
deliberate breathing? going natural cadence unnatural cadence? Again, no
right wrong, just depends goal is. third component.
component, again, hasn't really formalized literature Dr. Spiegel
working hard formalize research upcoming
review will provide links out, separate continuum
continuum interoception dissociation. now know
interoception is, people probably don't know don't realize dissociation
is. Often hear dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. people
pronounce dissociation. Guess what? Despite corrected many times


pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly
impact heart rate breathing. yanked around every experience.
instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person
environment breaking crying, yes, sad, important
sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, not get pulled
experience much lose ourselves. course areas
brain also leaning on, using metaphor, leaning
insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,
scared also going scared. push-pull
recognition distinct entities also, course, healthy desire
attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going
around you, dropping side continuum dissociated
not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people
position action-oriented focused, et cetera, come
yoga nidra, certainly useful practice. form meditation, call
meditation-ish, yoga nidra NSDR not typically people think
talk meditation. course, episode meditation. reason
bring yoga nidra NSDR many people meditate enhance sleep
ability reduce total amount sleep need. appears meditation
probably not ideal comparison yoga nidra NSDR, meditation
excellent, not superb, adjusting default mode network toward happiness
mindful present

02:11:33 Choosing Meditative Practice; Hypnosis

placing oneself healthy model interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
covered lot information, like think given key
decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want
thing going allow feel rested tired going allow
adjust state mind not want whatever reason,
anxious exhausted, et cetera." people, say practice like


NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form
meditation. also want just remind everybody app guides meditation, also
information intention setting, Waking app Sam
Harris can immensely beneficial. certainly found beneficial. know millions
people well, encourage check out. talked
determining continuums interoception exteroception
order dictate particular type meditation practice given
moment, whether not focus vision inward eyes closed focus
vision attention outward key component, whether not
cyclic breathing, will allow focus off breathing somewhat
easier non-cyclic breathing, doubling inhales exhales,
whether not breathing going natural not. And, course, need
determine whether not meditation practice designed enhance level
focus relax you. say designed enhance level focus,
doesn't necessarily mean won't relaxing. slow cadence breathing
third eye meditation, relaxing, yet focus refocus
practice, whereas something like yoga nidra NSDR going along
lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing
sleep need. previous podcasts, talked hypnosis, particularly
episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get
hypnosis now, just understand hypnosis distinct breathwork, yoga
nidra, NSDR, meditation even though includes
components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual
attention outward inward go hypnosis, involves breathing
particular kind, involves specific imagery, et cetera. hypnosis distinct
hypnosis really designed fix address specific problem, whereas meditation,
NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically not. can help fix problems
anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, generally not directed toward particular
line thinking. can be, typically not. Whereas hypnosis almost
always, especially clinical context, not stage hypnosis, clinical context
lot research show can, instance, help quitting smoking,
literally quadrupling effectiveness smoking cessation something like
Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
reducing pain number things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis really


great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

pronunciations, checked colleagues experts dissociation
disassociation, guess what? thing. Tomato, tomato, potato,
potato. going say dissociation. people will say disassociation, like
disassociate. people will say dissociate, okay? refer essentially
thing. Dissociation often talked context negative event.
indeed, dissociation unfortunately, or, say, adaptively associated
traumatic events. particular, violent sexual trauma, people will report feeling
body experience experience recollection
experience. Dissociation also described terms people
traumatic accident see someone killed right front them. First responders will
talk dissociating arrive scene. don't want provide, know,
gruesome imagery 'cause know people can pretty sensitive this, but,
know, showing scene car crash just seeing carnage incredible
damage bodies or, know, sort thing. Dissociation lies opposite end
continuum interoception. Now, earlier, said interoception opposite
end continuum exteroception, also opposite end continuum
dissociation. can provide better definitions perhaps make crystal
clear, here, actually reading upcoming review. feel comfortable reading
author review. nonetheless, interoception refers
process nervous system, meaning brain connections
body, senses, interprets, integrates, regulates signals originating within
body, thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping internal landscape
conscious unconscious level. Okay, lot words describe basically
process perceiving happening level surface skin
inward. Dissociation can thought opposite interoception. lack
bodily awareness removal one's conscious experience one's bodily
experience awareness. Again, often talked context
something traumatic, really, think health mental health physical
health, optimal place reside continuum interoception
dissociation somewhere middle. don't want dissociated life's
experiences, also don't want everything happens world profoundly
impact heart rate breathing. yanked around every experience.
instances yanked around pulled experience
something desire want, like seeing movie want see or,


instance, clinical hypnosis falling love, wonderful experiences sometimes also
sad experiences, right? able feel one's feelings depending life's events
important. dissociated feeling, is, feeling much
response everything happens also problematic. certain people,
instance, challenges called narrative distancing. is, see
someone movie getting hit almost flinch getting hit. see
someone scared happy movie feel scared happy way
seems like along ride little bit much. important
speaks ability that... Remember way back beginning episode,
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex insula. got prefrontal cortex
can say, hey, rational. movie, person happy sad, person
environment breaking crying, yes, sad, important
sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, not get pulled
experience much lose ourselves. course areas
brain also leaning on, using metaphor, leaning
insula ACC saying, hey, somebody care upset,
also going upset, somebody care happy, also going happy,
scared also going scared. push-pull
recognition distinct entities also, course, healthy desire
attached others' experiences experiences around us.
raising yet another continuum, right? already one continuum
interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, want think meditation
can serve mental health ability focus, particular mental
model can arrive incorporates interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
Again, extremely interoceptive, feeling everything body,
feelings body nearly completely account experience
far end continuum. dissociative end things, can see
going on, can react going on, bodily response essentially
shut down. either paralyzed shut down, kind no movement,
still engaging behaviors dissociated. Again, sadly, often
victims trauma report, able just go motions just
shut off emotions emotions just shut off. aren't feeling elevated
heart rate breathing. Sometimes can even quite scared, not even
perspiring



01:47:43 Model Interoception & Dissociation Continuum

showing signs autonomic arousal, is, fright stress panic. talk
model interoception dissociation meditative practice
can used try anchor us right location healthy location along
continuum. first imagine ideal mental health state. here, want
acknowledge, nobody achieves least maintains mental health state. want
imagine along interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum like
ball bearing, represent sphere can roll back forth along continuum.
one end, pure interoception, just feeling everything. end,
completely dissociated. Well, one version mental health, take
continuum fold sides looks like V, okay? one end,
interoception. end, dissociation. realize number people
listening not watching YouTube can't see hands
now, heel hands together, fingers hands apart looks like
V, like ball bearing. state like ball bearing base that.
trench perfectly balanced interoception dissociation, can feel
things, can register going outside world, feelings not
overwhelmed overtaken happening outside world.
perfect place able make rational decisions yet still feel feelings.
Wouldn't lovely? Wouldn't lovely like whenever
wanted to? frankly, nobody like time. typically, model
mental health mood well-being perception self versus others internal
versus external states one U, U shape, one end,
interoception, end, dissociation, kind U shaped,
state less like ball bearing base U that, know, gets
pushed side side. Maybe, know, heart races little bit
something bad good, ball bearing shifts towards interoception little bit
notice heart racing. perhaps, given moment, know,
mind drifts little bit watching movie talking partner
child complaining something thinking something else,
ball bearing shifts towards dissociative state little bit. mild form
dissociation. think people agree mentally healthy


involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going
around you, dropping side continuum dissociated
not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people
position action-oriented focused, et cetera, come
yoga nidra, certainly useful practice. form meditation, call
meditation-ish, yoga nidra NSDR not typically people think
talk meditation. course, episode meditation. reason
bring yoga nidra NSDR many people meditate enhance sleep
ability reduce total amount sleep need. appears meditation
probably not ideal comparison yoga nidra NSDR, meditation
excellent, not superb, adjusting default mode network toward happiness
mindful present

02:11:33 Choosing Meditative Practice; Hypnosis

placing oneself healthy model interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
covered lot information, like think given key
decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want
thing going allow feel rested tired going allow
adjust state mind not want whatever reason,
anxious exhausted, et cetera." people, say practice like


NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form
meditation. also want just remind everybody app guides meditation, also
information intention setting, Waking app Sam
Harris can immensely beneficial. certainly found beneficial. know millions
people well, encourage check out. talked
determining continuums interoception exteroception
order dictate particular type meditation practice given
moment, whether not focus vision inward eyes closed focus
vision attention outward key component, whether not
cyclic breathing, will allow focus off breathing somewhat
easier non-cyclic breathing, doubling inhales exhales,
whether not breathing going natural not. And, course, need
determine whether not meditation practice designed enhance level
focus relax you. say designed enhance level focus,
doesn't necessarily mean won't relaxing. slow cadence breathing
third eye meditation, relaxing, yet focus refocus
practice, whereas something like yoga nidra NSDR going along
lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing
sleep need. previous podcasts, talked hypnosis, particularly
episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get
hypnosis now, just understand hypnosis distinct breathwork, yoga
nidra, NSDR, meditation even though includes
components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual
attention outward inward go hypnosis, involves breathing
particular kind, involves specific imagery, et cetera. hypnosis distinct
hypnosis really designed fix address specific problem, whereas meditation,
NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically not. can help fix problems
anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, generally not directed toward particular
line thinking. can be, typically not. Whereas hypnosis almost
always, especially clinical context, not stage hypnosis, clinical context
lot research show can, instance, help quitting smoking,
literally quadrupling effectiveness smoking cessation something like
Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
reducing pain number things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis really


great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people
position action-oriented focused, et cetera, come
yoga nidra, certainly useful practice. form meditation, call
meditation-ish, yoga nidra NSDR not typically people think
talk meditation. course, episode meditation. reason
bring yoga nidra NSDR many people meditate enhance sleep
ability reduce total amount sleep need. appears meditation
probably not ideal comparison yoga nidra NSDR, meditation
excellent, not superb, adjusting default mode network toward happiness
mindful present

02:11:33 Choosing Meditative Practice; Hypnosis

placing oneself healthy model interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
covered lot information, like think given key
decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want
thing going allow feel rested tired going allow
adjust state mind not want whatever reason,
anxious exhausted, et cetera." people, say practice like


NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form
meditation. also want just remind everybody app guides meditation, also
information intention setting, Waking app Sam
Harris can immensely beneficial. certainly found beneficial. know millions
people well, encourage check out. talked
determining continuums interoception exteroception
order dictate particular type meditation practice given
moment, whether not focus vision inward eyes closed focus
vision attention outward key component, whether not
cyclic breathing, will allow focus off breathing somewhat
easier non-cyclic breathing, doubling inhales exhales,
whether not breathing going natural not. And, course, need
determine whether not meditation practice designed enhance level
focus relax you. say designed enhance level focus,
doesn't necessarily mean won't relaxing. slow cadence breathing
third eye meditation, relaxing, yet focus refocus
practice, whereas something like yoga nidra NSDR going along
lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing
sleep need. previous podcasts, talked hypnosis, particularly
episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get
hypnosis now, just understand hypnosis distinct breathwork, yoga
nidra, NSDR, meditation even though includes
components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual
attention outward inward go hypnosis, involves breathing
particular kind, involves specific imagery, et cetera. hypnosis distinct
hypnosis really designed fix address specific problem, whereas meditation,
NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically not. can help fix problems
anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, generally not directed toward particular
line thinking. can be, typically not. Whereas hypnosis almost
always, especially clinical context, not stage hypnosis, clinical context
lot research show can, instance, help quitting smoking,
literally quadrupling effectiveness smoking cessation something like
Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
reducing pain number things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis really


great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find

Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com

times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered

course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers

NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form

doesn't necessarily mean won't relaxing. slow cadence breathing
third eye meditation, relaxing, yet focus refocus
practice, whereas something like yoga nidra NSDR going along
lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing

great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

involve kind U-shaped model well, kind can shift back forth,
not extreme. not going interoceptive-biased way dissociated
kind extreme way. ball bearing stays near base U. Then,
course, states all, frankly, go time time
continuum interoception dissociation essentially flat, ball
bearing one location another, depending whether not watching movie
engrossed conversation activity
partner friend, et cetera, engrossed, maybe matching state,
right? number states can imagine matching one's state
actually healthy good, number conditions life
situations life matched someone else's condition like getting
yelled angry getting angry, pretty soon, know,
not best place along continuum. think many people,
find somewhere along continuum. number practices, including
meditation, including exercise, including getting good night's sleep, including therapy,
including journaling, including just activities like social engagement enjoy,
designed sort bring edges flat continuum U
concave shape ball bearing, meaning state awareness
state feeling feelings versus paying attention going around you,
somewhere, again, biased toward middle. curling edges
continuum either end, biases state toward middle. then, course,
extreme think almost everybody agree less pathologic,
one continuum no longer shaped like deep trench like V,
not shaped like U, not flat edges curled little bit even flat.
actually now convex. looks like mountain shape, peak, little ball bearing
top can either drop way one side pure interoception, just feeling beyond
ability pay attention anything else, just feeling one's feelings, angry,
sad, even happy, right? extremely happy manic can't pay
attention fact totally context, right, inappropriate going
around you, dropping side continuum dissociated
not engaged going around you. truly, quote, unquote,
checked out. shape one think almost clinicians, not clinicians,
people say pathologic either completely checked
completely absorbed going within around you. mental


model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent

can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts

model just created simple mental model. no means exhaustive,
incorporate lot think think mental health
talk ability mentally stable, feel one's feelings, still actively
engaged happening around us. again, continuum spans
interoceptive awareness dissociation extremes pathologic
somewhere middle healthier,

01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge

practices bias us toward middle default.
practices? Well, know sure sleep deprived, instance, tends
take us away trench shape U-shape continuum even flat continuum
starts make continuum convex. tends make us either feel like
completely checked exhausted completely labile, yanked
around whatever experience happening, just not able manage. sleep
is, always say, fundamental foundational layer mental health, physical
health, performance tends put us healthier place. is,
getting enough quality sleep consistently, tends put us middle
continuum. Sleep deprivation exactly opposite. pulls us apart. say
pulls us apart, not real term. tends make continuum less
concave, right, less bowl shaped, convex, hill shaped, not peak
mountain shape drops us one side other. addition, meditative
practice done regularly, can allow us become interoceptively aware
can allow us become exteroceptively aware, really just another
form dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided not extreme,
meditative practice can actually teach us deliberately move along continuum.
something, again, hasn't discussed whole lot literature.
discussed, say, pieces different literatures. look clinical
psychiatry literature, wonderful collection studies reviews will say
interoceptive awareness terrific except person aware
internal functioning not able engage world. Similarly, find
beautiful literature, research clinical literature, will say dissociation
terrible case trauma. fact, can put people positions repeating
behavior damaging them, can disengage


dissociated continue behavior, dissociation can
adaptive beneficial allows people, instance, create narrative
distancing not getting pulled every argument, someone screams
them, don't necessarily think fault. able say, "Hey, wait,"
know, use prefrontal cortex say, "Hey, wait, like, just upset
not mean something wrong. look evidence rationally." Okay?
thinking positive effects meditation mood, two aspects
important. first one talked earlier, present one's
experience correlates increased happiness. mind wander,
default mode network one mind wandering actually correlated
unhappy. earlier study talked about, study published
"Science." Now, course, meditation can make us present, not pay
attention whether not becoming present interoception
exteroception, is, interoception dissociation, don't pay attention
whether not bias one dissociation versus interoception, don't know
continuum, well, meditation actually can make things worse, not
better. words, somebody tremendous amount
interoceptive awareness, well, meditating internal state may not good,
actually, evidence may actually bad. give one little tiny
example. talked previously podcast, study
Wendy Suzuki's lab showing 13-minute-a-day meditation beneficial focus,
mood, et cetera, also clear number people typical third
eye meditation 13 minutes day, close sleep want
go sleep, hard time falling asleep, makes perfect sense
becoming interoceptively aware, ramping level focus.
meditation practice typically focus refocus practice, falling asleep involves
turning off thoughts focus focusing purely sensation,
thoughts kind fragment drift off sleep. big fan using
non-sleep deep rest yoga nidra. will provide links non-sleep deep rest yoga
nidra protocols. talked podcast before, protocols not
meditation per se. tend people defocus, anti-focus practices,
whereas meditation tends focusing practice. Along lines, meditation
practice one exteroceptively biased, focus things
outside body, can wonderful somebody tends focus much


inner landscape inner narrative, et cetera, can help get head
body, can beneficial. people not touch
emotions, aren't touch feel, actually can drive exact
path wrong them. today's discussion meditation, want
make sure parsing meditation rational way matches neural
circuitry involved and, importantly, sake practical purposes,
asking right question. interoceptively exteroceptively biased?
tend dissociate, tend sort feel everything big way, right?
heard term of, know, hypersensitive people things sort, and,
know, clinical terms, not. need assess
this, also need assess happen given day, will
dictated, course, well slept, life experience, et cetera.
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum one need address prior
meditative practice. And, again, solution answer response
answer whether not inward focused outward focused, again,
simple. Just opposite bias lies. is, tilted
towards interoception, exteroceptive focused practice. dissociative
you're... sounds sort pejorative, sounds bad, right? But, again,
somebody focused events outside body want gain
interoceptive awareness feeling state, will,

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long
time, terrific neuroscientist researcher teacher, et cetera, terrific
guest podcast. keep returning paper used many
measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases
understanding certain key concepts science science-based tools.
welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find
hubermanlab.com. Everything timestamped episode. Perfect
Sleep. then, course, done episodes sleep expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker UC Berkeley. can found hubermanlab.com
formats, timestamped. said, assertion made many


times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.
However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast
many times before, haven't heard talk it, practice called
yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people
position action-oriented focused, et cetera, come
yoga nidra, certainly useful practice. form meditation, call
meditation-ish, yoga nidra NSDR not typically people think
talk meditation. course, episode meditation. reason
bring yoga nidra NSDR many people meditate enhance sleep
ability reduce total amount sleep need. appears meditation
probably not ideal comparison yoga nidra NSDR, meditation
excellent, not superb, adjusting default mode network toward happiness
mindful present

02:11:33 Choosing Meditative Practice; Hypnosis

placing oneself healthy model interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
covered lot information, like think given key
decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want
thing going allow feel rested tired going allow
adjust state mind not want whatever reason,
anxious exhausted, et cetera." people, say practice like


NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form
meditation. also want just remind everybody app guides meditation, also
information intention setting, Waking app Sam
Harris can immensely beneficial. certainly found beneficial. know millions
people well, encourage check out. talked
determining continuums interoception exteroception
order dictate particular type meditation practice given
moment, whether not focus vision inward eyes closed focus
vision attention outward key component, whether not
cyclic breathing, will allow focus off breathing somewhat
easier non-cyclic breathing, doubling inhales exhales,
whether not breathing going natural not. And, course, need
determine whether not meditation practice designed enhance level
focus relax you. say designed enhance level focus,
doesn't necessarily mean won't relaxing. slow cadence breathing
third eye meditation, relaxing, yet focus refocus
practice, whereas something like yoga nidra NSDR going along
lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing
sleep need. previous podcasts, talked hypnosis, particularly
episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get
hypnosis now, just understand hypnosis distinct breathwork, yoga
nidra, NSDR, meditation even though includes
components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual
attention outward inward go hypnosis, involves breathing
particular kind, involves specific imagery, et cetera. hypnosis distinct
hypnosis really designed fix address specific problem, whereas meditation,
NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically not. can help fix problems
anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, generally not directed toward particular
line thinking. can be, typically not. Whereas hypnosis almost
always, especially clinical context, not stage hypnosis, clinical context
lot research show can, instance, help quitting smoking,
literally quadrupling effectiveness smoking cessation something like
Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
reducing pain number things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis really


great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think

know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard

And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,

Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought

However, practice, and, again, one talked podcast

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun

already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features

not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think

hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding

then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec

try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,

me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception

02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

well, want practice third eye center practice breathing focused.
One reasons many people meditate heard
experienced meditation can replace sleep can reduce one's overall sleep need.
interesting set questions, one dove literature
pursue answer to, came answer frankly little bit
complicated face boils simple protocols think
us can leverage order sleep better maybe even reduce total
amount sleep need, something think people want.
know, realize probably enjoy sleeping, certainly do, hard
get enough sleep, wouldn't wonderful, instance, able get
little less sleep still feel alert rested? First all, want point recent


study, and, again, one raised times post link it,
entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, emotion
regulation non-experienced meditators. work, again, Wendy Suzuki
guest Huberman Lab podcast, now Dean Arts
Sciences New York University run laboratory focused memory long

measures, thorough, results really interesting. Again,
13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. just mention control
group study listened podcast 13 minutes not improve attention,
memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, much meditation did, not
say podcasts aren't useful. won't mention podcast used. Fortunately,
not Huberman Lab podcast, like think least increases

welcome look paper see podcast used. quite well-known
podcast, interesting podcast, didn't change brain
fundamental way 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes daily meditation did.
And, again, something mentioned earlier important reemphasize now
mentioned people experiment meditated close bedtime,
trouble sleeping, again, makes sense meditation, least
common form, form used paper, focusing refocusing exercise.
Falling asleep involves focusing less. studies, however,
shown, asserted, rather, two 20-minute sessions per day meditation
can reduce need sleep. results debated. First all, understanding
sleep need individual, determining people can manage on,
meaning people can manage get six hours sleep better
eight, people actually manage probably better terms focusing
alertness slept little bit less might waking midway
sleep cycle. want learn this, can check one three
different episodes done. One Master Sleep. can find

times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not
meditation practice. simple way putting people meditate regularly,
reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people
took result interpreted saying, well, can't sleep, can just
meditate. one night, don't sleep trouble sleeping, just meditate
next day fine. Well, certainly not supported literature.

yoga nidra, literally means yoga sleep. practice not much
focused meditation, body scan focusing sensation body
actually trying turn off prefrontal cortex reduce activity. Yoga nidra scripts
can found YouTube elsewhere. paralleled similar practice
talked lot called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. put one world,
short one 10 minutes long. can just simply go YouTube put NSDR
last name, Huberman, one there. Again, completely
zero-cost. Yoga nidra NSDR shown fair number studies, not
many done traditional meditation, say third eye centered
meditation mindfulness meditation, shown replenish levels certain
neuromodulators like dopamine reduce cortisol, reduce stress hormone least


much and, read literature, significantly traditional meditation.
nice paper will provide link entitled Yoga nidra
practice shows improvement sleep patients chronic insomnia: randomized
control trial. Basically, study looks at, title suggests, people chronic
insomnia, although results certainly carry carry people
don't insomnia. key result, believe, paper, although many,
that, quote, "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly yoga nidra."
mean that? statistically significant reduction cortisol levels, stress
hormone, immediately yoga nidra practice believe paralleled
similar not equivalent practice NSDR. NSDR lot like yoga nidra
removes lot kind of, just call sort mystical language
intentions. focuses physiology body scans. know, want
acknowledge yoga nidra around thousands years certainly
NSDR. also want acknowledge that, brought also
"Altered Traits," sometimes language can barrier toward people embracing
practices. fact, recognized Jon Kabat-Zinn created
called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, MBSR, simply
mindfulness meditation reduce stress, called MBSR, mindfulness-based
stress reduction, way bring clinics otherwise perhaps
averse something called mindfulness meditation. Again, gets
sociology cultural aspects specific utility one practice
versus another. takeaway point. want get better falling staying
asleep falling back asleep wake middle night
generally challenged sleep issues, excellent behavioral practice
terrific data, meaning data show stress hormone, cortisol, can
significantly reduced well certain neurotransmitters can replenished well as,
key covered paper mentioned moments ago
yoga nidra, total amount sleep need can reduced, least
somewhat, well, yoga nidra NSDR practice done, frankly, time day
going beneficial. Whereas goal, believe, increase ability focus,
improve mood, and, perhaps importantly, able maneuver
deliberate way along interoceptive-exteroceptive interoceptive-dissociative
continuum talked much, really shift default mode
network one mind wanderer somebody can focus frankly


happier, well, traditional third eye center type meditation
traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation beneficial. Again, one
choose, either focusing inward focusing point outside you, again,
dictated whether not tend interoceptively biased
exteroceptively biased. want get better sleeping, want get better
falling asleep, want replace sleep lost, put quotes
colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets
pillow something sort. seriousness, clear replacing sleep
lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not
least beautiful study published Scandinavia showing 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels dopamine, puts people

02:11:33 Choosing Meditative Practice; Hypnosis

placing oneself healthy model interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
covered lot information, like think given key
decisions make developing meditative practice. important one,
course, will regularly? maybe somebody just answers
question saying, "Look, not going meditate regularly. just want
thing going allow feel rested tired going allow
adjust state mind not want whatever reason,
anxious exhausted, et cetera." people, say practice like


NSDR yoga nidra will immensely beneficial, will traditional form
meditation. also want just remind everybody app guides meditation, also
information intention setting, Waking app Sam
Harris can immensely beneficial. certainly found beneficial. know millions
people well, encourage check out. talked
determining continuums interoception exteroception
order dictate particular type meditation practice given
moment, whether not focus vision inward eyes closed focus
vision attention outward key component, whether not
cyclic breathing, will allow focus off breathing somewhat
easier non-cyclic breathing, doubling inhales exhales,
whether not breathing going natural not. And, course, need
determine whether not meditation practice designed enhance level
focus relax you. say designed enhance level focus,
doesn't necessarily mean won't relaxing. slow cadence breathing
third eye meditation, relaxing, yet focus refocus
practice, whereas something like yoga nidra NSDR going along
lines replenishing yourself, replacing sleep lost, maybe even reducing
sleep need. previous podcasts, talked hypnosis, particularly
episode Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair psychiatry. don't want get
hypnosis now, just understand hypnosis distinct breathwork, yoga
nidra, NSDR, meditation even though includes
components like focusing attention, involves actually directing visual
attention outward inward go hypnosis, involves breathing
particular kind, involves specific imagery, et cetera. hypnosis distinct
hypnosis really designed fix address specific problem, whereas meditation,
NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically not. can help fix problems
anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, generally not directed toward particular
line thinking. can be, typically not. Whereas hypnosis almost
always, especially clinical context, not stage hypnosis, clinical context
lot research show can, instance, help quitting smoking,
literally quadrupling effectiveness smoking cessation something like
Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
reducing pain number things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis really


great dealing specific issues

02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)

problems tackling those. Meditation tends focused things, no pun
intended. guessing probably wondering start or,
already avid meditator, go information. reason, just
wanted offer particular form meditation incorporates features
talked now single meditation practice, meditation
practice that, lack better name, called STB, Space-Time Bridging.
time component simple fact, focus attention,
visual attention otherwise, things close within body, tend fine
slicing time. sort think breath less second hands
clock existence, whereas tend focus things far away us,
tend parse carve time within bigger bins. ever seen airplane flying
distance, looks like moving very, slowly. right next
airplane, probably going 500 600 miles hour, go quickly.
not coincidence. Believe not, slice time domain life
experience everything vision, closer things are,
finely slice time. closely attention placed yourself,
closely slice time. focus visual attention far think
side world, instance, envision that, well, actually
slicing time broadly. Hopefully makes sense. Fine slicing like slow
motion, higher frame rate. Looking distance, actually taking bigger time
bins. even though things look like moving slowly,
fidelity, precision measuring time actually not good.
hours hand clock seems like moves slowly. Hopefully makes
sense you. meditation practice call Space-Time Bridging
incorporates everything talked today. balances interoception
exteroception, balances interoception dissociation, crosses various time
domains brain can encompass using vision. simple meditation,
one years, one starting
research on, just going share think actually quite fun
can quite informative. fact, people told can even lead


interesting insights meditation outside meditation.
simple, do, ideally outside window,
essentially close eyes. not going now, not going close
eyes meditation, describe it. close eyes focus
attention either third eye center breathing, try put 100%
perceptual awareness onto breathing third eye center duration
three breaths, okay? 100% trying 100% interoception.
open eyes, focus surface body someplace. find holding
hand sort arm's distance focusing palm hand focusing
visually, splitting attention now hand, also going
pay attention breath duration three full inhales exhales also
focusing hand, splitting interoception exteroception best can,
50/50. subsequently look location immediate
environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, focus attention location
also splitting attention still paying attention breathing,
duration three breaths, now exteroception
interoception. focus attention distance away, maybe
furthest distance can see. Now, useful window
balcony outdoors. focus furthest point, maybe horizon, furthest
point duration three breaths also paying attention breathing,
sort imagine bridge two find challenging focus both.
then, can little tricky, actually focus
fact, not imaginary thing, fact tiny spec
big ball floating space, right? Earth floating space.
try focus three breaths also acknowledging small body,
literally, seemingly large body, Earth, floating much larger,
larger, expansive place, universe, three breaths.
close eyes go right back interoception, three
breaths. focus interoception three breaths. might want march
different locations times back forth like, typically,
will just one segment pure interoception, palm hand, distance front
me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back body, et cetera.
useful? useful? interesting, just crazy idea?
Well, reason useful, believe, deliberately step awareness,


perception every position along interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
Now, say remain connected to, say yoga classes, aware of,
guess scientific way state it, aware one's breath,
wanted, actually try put awareness completely outside yourself,
people will find challenging already paying attention
breath. just hard do, find easier just split awareness interoception
exteroception. stepping different locations deliberately
placing perception, awareness back pure interoception,
essentially practicing exercising incredible ability human mind
deliberately place perception specific locations along interoceptive-
exteroceptive continuum. think useful many us, including
myself, tend get locked one location along continuum. instance,
scrolling phone long period time, may forget bodily
sensations, generally forget things going world.
focused things world, oftentimes can forget internal
sensations going internally. functional work, life,
relationship, aspects, including ability fall asleep, involves stepping
along different locations, which, again, not just physical locations
third eye center breathing hand horizon. just stations within
space. remember, one those, just way visual system
time domain interlocked one another, sets mind particular time
domain. much involves functional human involves
dynamically adjusting attention computer
question somebody asks back again, text messaging listening
lecture podcast listening lecture podcast going back
mode commuting, making commute either relaxing maybe work
commute connect family friends, et cetera. much fatigue life
the, say, maladaptive behaviors emotions show life really
not set behaviors emotions wrong right, rather
inappropriately matched space-time domain in, which, again, just
fancy nerd speak saying present mindful wonderful byproduct
meditation practice, one stations along space-time continuum.
key element step practice deliberately
flexibly dynamically able engage conversation, disengage focus,


focus disengage work focusing actually
conversation world move interoceptive awareness one
dynamically engaged things around you. realize might
sound little bit vague. reason, encourage not think much,
rather try practice, see works you. doesn't, fine. think
good one people find third eye center breathing-focused interoceptive
meditation might enjoyable beneficial them, might want
try something new, people might find tends put much
head. think also useful people tend overly
exteroceptive, dissociative end continuum, need bring bit
interoceptive awareness, either can't uncomfortable
simply not interested comfortable feeling much
internal state can either overwhelming just simply not way
want feel. Now, round up, want acknowledge
enormous number rooms within house, rather, say, within castle
meditation, including, instance, intention setting mantras enormous
number different features meditation practices simply not time
go and/or research not completely ironed yet.
reason, future episodes not long now, going sitting experts
meditation include neuroscientists clinicians, experts meditation
certainly versed topics, can't point specific research
studies can certainly point us toward utility things like mantras intentions

times certainly popular press regular meditation can reduce one's
overall sleep need controversial following reason. groups find
indeed case, interpretation stress reduction brought
regular meditative practice, case, regular, tends one or,
typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. quite lot, think,
people. mean, think 40 minutes, isn't much time overall,
people will stick twice day, 20-minute meditation practice consistently.
Well, idea stress reduction, clear not debated, brought
type meditation practice good offsetting cortisol increases
associated reduced sleep leading people able function cognitively
physically better reduced sleep not

reducing stress. reduction stress reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol
healthy, restricted early part day. don't want many
peaks cortisol, especially not late day. meditating, get healthy
pattern cortisol release, sort inoculate somewhat unhealthy
pattern cortisol release, consequence, either sleep people get
deeper and/or total amount sleep need reduced. Now, lot people

colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come with... come
with, Matt? Probably alarm clock and, don't know, blankets

lost area research still active ongoing, NSDR yoga
nidra promising, not downright useful, replacing sleep lost.
Certainly small amount data exists now point fact are, not

doesn't necessarily mean won't relaxing. slow cadence breathing

hypnosis really designed fix address specific problem, whereas meditation,
NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically not. can help fix problems
anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, generally not directed toward particular

always, especially clinical context, not stage hypnosis, clinical context
lot research show can, instance, help quitting smoking,
literally quadrupling effectiveness smoking cessation something like
Reveri app people just try go cold turkey reducing insomnia
