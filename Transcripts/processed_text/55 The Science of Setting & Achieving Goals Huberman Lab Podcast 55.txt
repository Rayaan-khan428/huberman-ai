00:13:55 Brain Circuits Setting & Pursuing Goals

Again, ROKA, R-O-K-A.com enter code Huberman checkout. talk
science particular, biology neuroscience setting
achieving goals. Setting achieving goals, not uniquely human endeavor.
animals set attempt achieve goals, honeybee attempts collect honey
bring back hive. herbivore will go forage plants will also
need reproduce point life. So, will need find mate maybe even


raise young, depending species is. Predators will hunt kill
eat food avoid getting injured process. also
raise young, et cetera. humans among animals, say
animals among us need set goals make efforts achieve
goals. Now, emphasize commonality process? reason emphasize
commonality process, turns one basic system
animals, including humans, set attempt achieve goals. Now humans
unique ability orient mind toward immediate goals, moderately termed
goals, meaning things might exist scale week month even year
long-term goals, like lifetime goal goal lasts decade, takes
decade achieve. makes us unique. course don't access
mindset thinking emotions animals, know
that, common neural circuits, meaning brain areas, present animal species
humans, responsible orienting thinking action toward particular
goals. Another thing really unique human brain, able
multiple goals interacting once. So, instance, probably fitness
goals, goals relationships different kinds, friendships, romantic partnerships
well maybe scholastic goals. Maybe school pursuing kind
learning outside school environment indoor, business goals
financial goals, able multiple goals once. animals this,
humans unique ability juggle lot goals. actually one
major challenges pursuing goals, goal pursuit often interacts, meaning
can spend 100% time chasing one particular goal, might effective
goal, tend fall back goals. can imagine
plays out. working very, hard, solely focused business often,
health will suffer. solely focused health often, things will
suffer. juggle goal setting goal pursuits.
today, going talk number different ways, work
well called, interleaving goals, focusing common practice common
set mechanisms present aspects goal seeking. process?
Well, turns out, neural circuit. neural circuit, simply collection brain areas,
active particular sequence give rise particular behavior perception.
instance, feel happy, not brain area,
happy brain area, electrically active. Rather, going involve numerous brain


areas, active concert different degrees. way, keys
piano, together, played appropriate sequence, represent particular song.
never say one key piano represents song, key
necessary. Similarly, brain, can say brain area might necessary,
not sufficient give us particular experience generate particular behavior.
think goal seeking pursuit goals kind brain,
doesn't matter goal is. involves common set neural circuits
neural circuit like orient us toward today. will return times,
involves learning couple names, don't worry much
memorizing these. Just important understand logic put together
will explain make clear. want learn names, great.
One brain areas so-called, amygdala. amygdala often
associated fear, might say, wow, involved goal directed
behavior? Well, lot goal directed behavior, avoid punishments, including
things like embarrassment financial ruin things sort. amygdala
sense anxiety fear, actually built circuits generate goal
seeking motivation pursuit goals. areas so-called, ventral
striatum. striatum part called, basal ganglia. basal ganglia,
neural circuit, can simply described neural circuit helps us
generate go, meaning initiation action no-go, prevention action type
scenarios. Let make even simpler. ventral striatum part thing
called, basal ganglia. basal ganglia sort two circuits within it. One circuit
involved getting us things, like going get tomorrow going
run five miles first thing morning. don't know actually going that,
just using example. Another circuit within basal ganglia, no-go
circuit, one says, no, not going go second cookie third
cookie. not going eat that. go circuit one
responsible instead eating something else. Okay, go no-go circuits
within basal ganglia. got amygdala, think kind fear
anxiety avoidance. got, basal ganglia, initiating action
preventing action. so-called, cortex. cortex outer shell
brain, two sub regions cortex, involved goal-directed
behavior. One lateral prefrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex involved in, so-called,
executive function, things like planning. Thinking things different timescales,


not just want immediate term, might want tomorrow
next day actions currently going relate, future. so-
called, orbitofrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex large number functions, one
key functions orbitofrontal cortex, involved meshing emotionality
current state progress comparing emotionality might be,
closer goal. So, basically four areas, one involved anxiety,
one involved emotion, one involved planning another involved go, no-go
action. bunch detail, wanted make really simple everyone,
say four areas. One area associated anxiety fear,
amygdala. second involved action inaction, remember go, no-go,
basal ganglia. one involved planning thinking across
different timescales, lateral prefrontal cortex. fourth one,
involved emotionality, sit emotionally present, compared think
will emotionally, reach particular goal orbitofrontal
cortex. Again, don't need know names. don't need know
details, just understand different elements involved decision-making
processes lead us toward particular goals us update goal seeking, et
cetera. One key thing doesn't matter goal is, circuits involved.
whether not trying build company, billion dollar company
going go public, thinking planning craft day home kids
yourself, thinking movie go see. Goals, goal seeking
assessing progress towards goals, involve exact neural circuits. really
remarkable.

00:21:52 Determining Value Goals

also convenient discussion today. going circuits, can
basically boiled two particular things. first is, value information, trying

business goal execution. brings us back neural circuit components,
remember, neural circuit, involving four things earlier, amygdala, striatum,
orbitofrontal cortex prefrontal cortex. work together, divide whole

00:30:29 Peripersonal Space vs. Extrapersonal Space

allowing reach goals, quickly indeed less effort. fact,
start tool now move information, want
make sure people coming away practical things can
implement. indeed, things can even course listening
watching podcast. first thing do, understand difference
peripersonal space extra personal space. Peripersonal space, space,
literally, within inside body, surface skin immediate
environment. Peripersonal space, key concept neuroscience
particular neural circuits particular chemicals, geared toward,
called consummatory behaviors, meaning, using things consuming things
enjoying things, immediate peripersonal space. Let give
example myself, just make concrete. can imagine similar examples
right now. Within current peripersonal space, interoception,
understanding perception internal body. So, quickly breathing, heart
rate, feelings surface skin, et cetera. also, within confines
peripersonal space, coffee mug, listening this, can't see this,
lifting coffee mug, going take sip coffee. consummatory
behavior, coffee, don't much motivate much get it.
things here, pens computer, et cetera. things peripersonal space
consuming things, generally governed set neurochemicals,
center around neuromodulator serotonin. others well, things
like oxytocin, mainly serotonin. Contrast that, so-called, extra personal
space. Extrapersonal space everything beyond confines reach.
something next room. will something street. will something
location, space time. neuromodulators neurochemicals,
associated kind thinking about, anything extra personal space,
distinct neurochemicals neuromodulators, involved thinking
making actions towards peripersonal space. molecule
associated thinking orienting toward extra personal space, again,
things beyond confines skin skin, dopamine. vitally
important concept understand, setting goals seeking goals.
good goal seeking, good setting goals assessing goals,


achieve goals, able toggle back forth clear
understanding peripersonal space, feel
immediate present. ability understand extra personal
space ability move extra personal space. simple way
conceive this, evaluate progress peripersonal space.
evaluate feel, pursuit, even haven't initiated pursuit yet.
feel particular goal, truly feeling experience
now, even though goal future. going evaluate whether not,
made progress today yesterday not, evaluation feel
immediate peripersonal space. However, moving toward goal, involves orienting
thinking towards extra personal space. go today's episode,
going teach technique rather neuroscience-based tool, will allow
continually transition back forth peripersonal space extra
personal space way will allow update evaluate better execute
goal seeking. whole principle behind this, human beings, like
animals, make evaluations whether not right track.
However, important thing understand, humans particular can
different timescales. don't just pursue food 'cause hungry, pursue food,
excuse me, particular meal, might people tomorrow. can
modulate timescale way animals don't. adjust goal
seeking, different timescales. addition that, humans exquisitely good
biasing behavior toward particular goals long periods time.
lot mistakes there, fact, things outright wrong literature
particular, internet, kind wellness fitness cognitive fitness
space, send people wrong path things will talk
minutes. things like visualization, visualization visualization big
goal, best way achieve goals.

00:35:39 Visually Focusing Goal Line Improves Performance

multitasking, shown interesting physiological signature,
multitask, jump back forth things, increase

happens focus particular location? Believe not, increase
particular feature blood pressure. Now body has, course, arteries, veins
capillaries, heart pumps blood, first arteries,
components vascular system. so-called, blood pressure. Blood
pressure just much, fluid volume pressing arteries, veins
capillaries. can imagine pipe little fluid moving it, low

stick long-term goals. long-term goal looked at, one related
saving money later life. something lot people struggle with, lot
people hard time investing money saving money later life. Simply
human beings, vary extent worry going
happen later. also phenomenon so-called, delay discounting. Delay
discounting, fact goals, become less rewarding exist
future. may experienced walking past donut shop. love donuts
just going admit it, spot. love smell them. love
taste them. try eat 'cause told not good indeed,
don't think are. occasionally cave eat one many. general, try not
cave immediately rewarding properties smell taste donut.
But, know smell donut smell wonderful piece food,
immediate term, brings level focus, mental focus immediate
phase. feels rewarding, like now, just good.
actually extend reward tomorrow next thing think, today
happens Saturday, recording, but, Tuesday morning, going
get donut. doesn't value reward system, doesn't work
well long-term goals. not salient. not tangible, goal, especially
something like donut. Whereas kinds goals work, place
longer term can create heightened sense motivation, tend things
much rewarding us. delay discounting simply says that,
time given goal is, less effective reward will motivating one's
behavior. indeed see saving money retirement, see
sorts long-term investment, Balcetis Lab, therefore experiment,
looked people's tendency save money later life. groups
created study, really interesting. one group, imagine,
like 30 40 years older. invest certain amount money,
according whatever thought need. measured
amount set aside saved later life. group, actually


viewed photos themselves, picture, images artificially,
digitally aged, see 30 40 years future.
turns people second group, simply perceiving image,
future, invested far money later life. set aside money. Somehow
bridged gap immediate experience life longer arc toward
going like 30 40 years. powerful result opinion,
says again, visual perception future visual
perception present, allows us anchor goal directed systems
motivation take things immediate term might not seem useful. So,
can imagine sorts variations this. can imagine every time want
donut, see vision actual physical picture consequence

indeed study looked people will invest exercise healthy

seeing images future, go healthy
unhealthy route. again, point visual system, see, principally
important defining immediate term. Even see relates
something far off distance. think phenomenal studies get right
important issue kicked around

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far

kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details

this, focused particular point visual space particular goal

use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state

like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique

tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual

particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards

animals among us need set goals make efforts achieve
goals. Now, emphasize commonality process? reason emphasize

animals, including humans, set attempt achieve goals. Now humans
unique ability orient mind toward immediate goals, moderately termed
goals, meaning things might exist scale week month even year
long-term goals, like lifetime goal goal lasts decade, takes
decade achieve. makes us unique. course don't access
mindset thinking emotions animals, know
that, common neural circuits, meaning brain areas, present animal species
humans, responsible orienting thinking action toward particular
goals. Another thing really unique human brain, able
multiple goals interacting once. So, instance, probably fitness
goals, goals relationships different kinds, friendships, romantic partnerships
well maybe scholastic goals. Maybe school pursuing kind
learning outside school environment indoor, business goals
financial goals, able multiple goals once. animals this,
humans unique ability juggle lot goals. actually one
major challenges pursuing goals, goal pursuit often interacts, meaning
can spend 100% time chasing one particular goal, might effective
goal, tend fall back goals. can imagine
plays out. working very, hard, solely focused business often,
health will suffer. solely focused health often, things will
suffer. juggle goal setting goal pursuits.
today, going talk number different ways, work
well called, interleaving goals, focusing common practice common
set mechanisms present aspects goal seeking. process?
Well, turns out, neural circuit. neural circuit, simply collection brain areas,
active particular sequence give rise particular behavior perception.
instance, feel happy, not brain area,
happy brain area, electrically active. Rather, going involve numerous brain


areas, active concert different degrees. way, keys
piano, together, played appropriate sequence, represent particular song.
never say one key piano represents song, key
necessary. Similarly, brain, can say brain area might necessary,
not sufficient give us particular experience generate particular behavior.
think goal seeking pursuit goals kind brain,
doesn't matter goal is. involves common set neural circuits
neural circuit like orient us toward today. will return times,
involves learning couple names, don't worry much
memorizing these. Just important understand logic put together
will explain make clear. want learn names, great.
One brain areas so-called, amygdala. amygdala often
associated fear, might say, wow, involved goal directed
behavior? Well, lot goal directed behavior, avoid punishments, including
things like embarrassment financial ruin things sort. amygdala
sense anxiety fear, actually built circuits generate goal
seeking motivation pursuit goals. areas so-called, ventral
striatum. striatum part called, basal ganglia. basal ganglia,
neural circuit, can simply described neural circuit helps us
generate go, meaning initiation action no-go, prevention action type
scenarios. Let make even simpler. ventral striatum part thing
called, basal ganglia. basal ganglia sort two circuits within it. One circuit
involved getting us things, like going get tomorrow going
run five miles first thing morning. don't know actually going that,
just using example. Another circuit within basal ganglia, no-go
circuit, one says, no, not going go second cookie third
cookie. not going eat that. go circuit one
responsible instead eating something else. Okay, go no-go circuits
within basal ganglia. got amygdala, think kind fear
anxiety avoidance. got, basal ganglia, initiating action
preventing action. so-called, cortex. cortex outer shell
brain, two sub regions cortex, involved goal-directed
behavior. One lateral prefrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex involved in, so-called,
executive function, things like planning. Thinking things different timescales,


not just want immediate term, might want tomorrow
next day actions currently going relate, future. so-
called, orbitofrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex large number functions, one
key functions orbitofrontal cortex, involved meshing emotionality
current state progress comparing emotionality might be,
closer goal. So, basically four areas, one involved anxiety,
one involved emotion, one involved planning another involved go, no-go
action. bunch detail, wanted make really simple everyone,
say four areas. One area associated anxiety fear,
amygdala. second involved action inaction, remember go, no-go,
basal ganglia. one involved planning thinking across
different timescales, lateral prefrontal cortex. fourth one,
involved emotionality, sit emotionally present, compared think
will emotionally, reach particular goal orbitofrontal
cortex. Again, don't need know names. don't need know
details, just understand different elements involved decision-making
processes lead us toward particular goals us update goal seeking, et
cetera. One key thing doesn't matter goal is, circuits involved.
whether not trying build company, billion dollar company

assessing progress towards goals, involve exact neural circuits. really
remarkable.

00:21:52 Determining Value Goals

also convenient discussion today. going circuits, can
basically boiled two particular things. first is, value information, trying
understand whether not, something really worth pursuing not. So, placing value

actions take actions not take, given value particular goal
given moments time. want say again. component circuit
involved action, whether not act not act, based
assessment value goal particular moment time. going


hear say again, episode, value information goal
key. why, basically one neuro-transmitter rather neuromodulator
system, governs goal setting, goal assessment goal pursuit.
neuromodulator dopamine. Dopamine common currency assess

00:30:29 Peripersonal Space vs. Extrapersonal Space

allowing reach goals, quickly indeed less effort. fact,
start tool now move information, want
make sure people coming away practical things can
implement. indeed, things can even course listening
watching podcast. first thing do, understand difference
peripersonal space extra personal space. Peripersonal space, space,
literally, within inside body, surface skin immediate
environment. Peripersonal space, key concept neuroscience
particular neural circuits particular chemicals, geared toward,
called consummatory behaviors, meaning, using things consuming things
enjoying things, immediate peripersonal space. Let give
example myself, just make concrete. can imagine similar examples
right now. Within current peripersonal space, interoception,
understanding perception internal body. So, quickly breathing, heart
rate, feelings surface skin, et cetera. also, within confines
peripersonal space, coffee mug, listening this, can't see this,
lifting coffee mug, going take sip coffee. consummatory
behavior, coffee, don't much motivate much get it.
things here, pens computer, et cetera. things peripersonal space
consuming things, generally governed set neurochemicals,
center around neuromodulator serotonin. others well, things
like oxytocin, mainly serotonin. Contrast that, so-called, extra personal
space. Extrapersonal space everything beyond confines reach.
something next room. will something street. will something
location, space time. neuromodulators neurochemicals,
associated kind thinking about, anything extra personal space,
distinct neurochemicals neuromodulators, involved thinking
making actions towards peripersonal space. molecule
associated thinking orienting toward extra personal space, again,
things beyond confines skin skin, dopamine. vitally
important concept understand, setting goals seeking goals.
good goal seeking, good setting goals assessing goals,


achieve goals, able toggle back forth clear
understanding peripersonal space, feel
immediate present. ability understand extra personal
space ability move extra personal space. simple way
conceive this, evaluate progress peripersonal space.
evaluate feel, pursuit, even haven't initiated pursuit yet.
feel particular goal, truly feeling experience
now, even though goal future. going evaluate whether not,
made progress today yesterday not, evaluation feel
immediate peripersonal space. However, moving toward goal, involves orienting
thinking towards extra personal space. go today's episode,
going teach technique rather neuroscience-based tool, will allow
continually transition back forth peripersonal space extra
personal space way will allow update evaluate better execute
goal seeking. whole principle behind this, human beings, like
animals, make evaluations whether not right track.
However, important thing understand, humans particular can
different timescales. don't just pursue food 'cause hungry, pursue food,
excuse me, particular meal, might people tomorrow. can
modulate timescale way animals don't. adjust goal
seeking, different timescales. addition that, humans exquisitely good
biasing behavior toward particular goals long periods time.
lot mistakes there, fact, things outright wrong literature
particular, internet, kind wellness fitness cognitive fitness
space, send people wrong path things will talk
minutes. things like visualization, visualization visualization big
goal, best way achieve goals.

00:35:39 Visually Focusing Goal Line Improves Performance

fact, not case, much approach this. now like
shift gears towards talking things, people get badly wrong
setting assessing executing goals. based peer reviewed research,
think solid. know solid. runs counter many us

heard multitasking bad, doesn't allow focus. want achieve
anything, want accomplish anything, not multitask. Well, turns out,
wrong. turns role multitasking, multitasking

so, might've looked and, know, take look sky looked around
make sure people not there, et cetera. stands reason
will case. Again, neural circuits haven't evolved much. Now,
multitasking, shown interesting physiological signature,
multitask, jump back forth things, increase

thing sake discussion. increase neurotransmitter
epinephrine, adrenaline. so, really nice studies now, pointing

happens focus particular location? Believe not, increase
particular feature blood pressure. Now body has, course, arteries, veins
capillaries, heart pumps blood, first arteries,
components vascular system. so-called, blood pressure. Blood
pressure just much, fluid volume pressing arteries, veins
capillaries. can imagine pipe little fluid moving it, low

stuff, moving forward, even pressure. blood pressure
probably blood pressure measured. always two numbers.
top number, systolic blood pressure. bottom number,

blood pressure will rise heart beats, fluid


moving pipes arteries veins capillaries.
top number called systole systolic blood pressure,
pressure time, heart contracts. top number, normally,
healthy blood pressure, somewhere range 90 120 millimeters

intermediate goals, long-term goals best achieve those.
going move specifically protocols can use. protocol
specifically developed you, listeners, order incorporate signs

00:51:55 Tool 2: Use Focal Vision Initiate Goal Pursuit

want pursue best route pursue achieve goal. Focusing
visual attention one particular point, incredibly effective types goal
pursuit. like read scientific studies read review


scientific studies, looked how, narrowing one's visual attention, can really
enhance effectiveness pursuing goals, put link study. title
study is, keeping goal sight, testing influence narrowed visual attention
physical activity. paper Emily Balcetis's Lab, focuses mainly
physical activities, mentioned things well. article
published Personality Social Psychology Bulletin 2020, recent.
exceptional paper opinion, really gets heart works
examples implemented. apply visual tool,
simple way, type goal want pursue. already know goal
want pursue, maybe workout, maybe cognitive work particular
sort. Again, process simple. going focus visual attention one
point beyond peripersonal space, computer.
wall, horizon. distance going focus
visual attention there. effort going hold visual attention
30 60 seconds, might blink, okay, going try hold
visual attention there. no moving head around. No diverting attention
locations. people will find easy do. people will find quite
hard. mind may drift cognitively, okay, try bring visual attention
common point. Several episodes ago, talked how, actually
studies looking developing kind training students, ADHD data
actually quite encouraging. people ADHD focus issues
attentional issues, can effective. people don't, can also effective.
Again, places brain body state readiness idea
move particular actions, bring closer goal. haven't yet talked
set goals assess progress. simply pursue goals.
visual component important, fact, argue visual system
harnessing visual attention narrow point, going effective way,
get brain body mode action, pursue whatever goal
trying pursue. practice stark contrast multitasking, definition
attention moving place place place. mentioned multitasking can
effective getting system somewhat increased level activation,
can pursue focused goal. visual attention particular point,
going effective way bring system



00:54:40 Tool 3: Use Aged Self-Images Self-Motivate

state readiness action goal pursuit. another really interesting
way, can leverage visual system toward long-term goals. Balcetis Lab
also done, really interesting experiments, looking people's ability set
stick long-term goals. long-term goal looked at, one related
saving money later life. something lot people struggle with, lot
people hard time investing money saving money later life. Simply
human beings, vary extent worry going
happen later. also phenomenon so-called, delay discounting. Delay
discounting, fact goals, become less rewarding exist
future. may experienced walking past donut shop. love donuts
just going admit it, spot. love smell them. love
taste them. try eat 'cause told not good indeed,
don't think are. occasionally cave eat one many. general, try not
cave immediately rewarding properties smell taste donut.
But, know smell donut smell wonderful piece food,
immediate term, brings level focus, mental focus immediate
phase. feels rewarding, like now, just good.
actually extend reward tomorrow next thing think, today
happens Saturday, recording, but, Tuesday morning, going
get donut. doesn't value reward system, doesn't work
well long-term goals. not salient. not tangible, goal, especially
something like donut. Whereas kinds goals work, place
longer term can create heightened sense motivation, tend things
much rewarding us. delay discounting simply says that,
time given goal is, less effective reward will motivating one's
behavior. indeed see saving money retirement, see
sorts long-term investment, Balcetis Lab, therefore experiment,
looked people's tendency save money later life. groups
created study, really interesting. one group, imagine,
like 30 40 years older. invest certain amount money,
according whatever thought need. measured
amount set aside saved later life. group, actually


viewed photos themselves, picture, images artificially,
digitally aged, see 30 40 years future.
turns people second group, simply perceiving image,
future, invested far money later life. set aside money. Somehow
bridged gap immediate experience life longer arc toward
going like 30 40 years. powerful result opinion,
says again, visual perception future visual
perception present, allows us anchor goal directed systems
motivation take things immediate term might not seem useful. So,
can imagine sorts variations this. can imagine every time want
donut, see vision actual physical picture consequence
eaten many donuts every day next 10 years. don't know
image look like 'cause never seen it. not experiment
necessarily need not motivated eat donuts,
confess, somebody think pretty good managing resources. think
see image 70 75, many things associated
visual images. Like body must feel like, needs probably going
like state age. sorts things may may not still able
age. anchors back immediate goal-directed behaviors,
setting aside money retirement. investing one's health practices.
indeed study looked people will invest exercise healthy
eating. just think future might like future versus
seeing images future, go healthy
unhealthy route. again, point visual system, see, principally
important defining immediate term. Even see relates
something far off distance. think phenomenal studies get right
important issue kicked around

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining

brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

01:39:50 Tool 9: Space-Time Bridging



regulating dopamine system. want sure include tool,
especially powerful me, grounded neuroscience research
psychology research. describe tool next, think see ways

today, going talk number different ways, work
well called, interleaving goals, focusing common practice common

Well, turns out, neural circuit. neural circuit, simply collection brain areas,
active particular sequence give rise particular behavior perception.
instance, feel happy, not brain area,
happy brain area, electrically active. Rather, going involve numerous brain


areas, active concert different degrees. way, keys

never say one key piano represents song, key
necessary. Similarly, brain, can say brain area might necessary,
not sufficient give us particular experience generate particular behavior.
think goal seeking pursuit goals kind brain,
doesn't matter goal is. involves common set neural circuits
neural circuit like orient us toward today. will return times,
involves learning couple names, don't worry much
memorizing these. Just important understand logic put together
will explain make clear. want learn names, great.
One brain areas so-called, amygdala. amygdala often
associated fear, might say, wow, involved goal directed
behavior? Well, lot goal directed behavior, avoid punishments, including
things like embarrassment financial ruin things sort. amygdala
sense anxiety fear, actually built circuits generate goal
seeking motivation pursuit goals. areas so-called, ventral
striatum. striatum part called, basal ganglia. basal ganglia,
neural circuit, can simply described neural circuit helps us
generate go, meaning initiation action no-go, prevention action type
scenarios. Let make even simpler. ventral striatum part thing
called, basal ganglia. basal ganglia sort two circuits within it. One circuit
involved getting us things, like going get tomorrow going
run five miles first thing morning. don't know actually going that,
just using example. Another circuit within basal ganglia, no-go
circuit, one says, no, not going go second cookie third
cookie. not going eat that. go circuit one
responsible instead eating something else. Okay, go no-go circuits
within basal ganglia. got amygdala, think kind fear
anxiety avoidance. got, basal ganglia, initiating action
preventing action. so-called, cortex. cortex outer shell
brain, two sub regions cortex, involved goal-directed
behavior. One lateral prefrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex involved in, so-called,
executive function, things like planning. Thinking things different timescales,


not just want immediate term, might want tomorrow
next day actions currently going relate, future. so-
called, orbitofrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex large number functions, one
key functions orbitofrontal cortex, involved meshing emotionality
current state progress comparing emotionality might be,
closer goal. So, basically four areas, one involved anxiety,
one involved emotion, one involved planning another involved go, no-go
action. bunch detail, wanted make really simple everyone,
say four areas. One area associated anxiety fear,
amygdala. second involved action inaction, remember go, no-go,
basal ganglia. one involved planning thinking across
different timescales, lateral prefrontal cortex. fourth one,
involved emotionality, sit emotionally present, compared think
will emotionally, reach particular goal orbitofrontal
cortex. Again, don't need know names. don't need know

00:30:29 Peripersonal Space vs. Extrapersonal Space

allowing reach goals, quickly indeed less effort. fact,
start tool now move information, want
make sure people coming away practical things can
implement. indeed, things can even course listening
watching podcast. first thing do, understand difference
peripersonal space extra personal space. Peripersonal space, space,
literally, within inside body, surface skin immediate
environment. Peripersonal space, key concept neuroscience
particular neural circuits particular chemicals, geared toward,
called consummatory behaviors, meaning, using things consuming things
enjoying things, immediate peripersonal space. Let give
example myself, just make concrete. can imagine similar examples
right now. Within current peripersonal space, interoception,
understanding perception internal body. So, quickly breathing, heart
rate, feelings surface skin, et cetera. also, within confines
peripersonal space, coffee mug, listening this, can't see this,

things here, pens computer, et cetera. things peripersonal space
consuming things, generally governed set neurochemicals,
center around neuromodulator serotonin. others well, things
like oxytocin, mainly serotonin. Contrast that, so-called, extra personal

thinking towards extra personal space. go today's episode,
going teach technique rather neuroscience-based tool, will allow
continually transition back forth peripersonal space extra
personal space way will allow update evaluate better execute
goal seeking. whole principle behind this, human beings, like
animals, make evaluations whether not right track.
However, important thing understand, humans particular can

excuse me, particular meal, might people tomorrow. can
modulate timescale way animals don't. adjust goal

now described psychology underlying physiology. Now,
like mesh within context actual specific goal setting goal pursuit.
many probably thinking is, well, physiology,
psychology, actually apply towards setting achieving
goals? Well, that, understanding mental frame attention
always either positioned, peripersonal space, focused immediate
possessions state, towards things outside you. also ability,
dynamically travel back forth those. next, going talk
about, literature says things like visualization, immediate
intermediate goals, long-term goals best achieve those.
going move specifically protocols can use. protocol

00:51:55 Tool 2: Use Focal Vision Initiate Goal Pursuit

want pursue best route pursue achieve goal. Focusing
visual attention one particular point, incredibly effective types goal
pursuit. like read scientific studies read review


scientific studies, looked how, narrowing one's visual attention, can really
enhance effectiveness pursuing goals, put link study. title
study is, keeping goal sight, testing influence narrowed visual attention
physical activity. paper Emily Balcetis's Lab, focuses mainly
physical activities, mentioned things well. article
published Personality Social Psychology Bulletin 2020, recent.
exceptional paper opinion, really gets heart works
examples implemented. apply visual tool,
simple way, type goal want pursue. already know goal
want pursue, maybe workout, maybe cognitive work particular
sort. Again, process simple. going focus visual attention one

visual attention there. no moving head around. No diverting attention
locations. people will find easy do. people will find quite
hard. mind may drift cognitively, okay, try bring visual attention
common point. Several episodes ago, talked how, actually
studies looking developing kind training students, ADHD data
actually quite encouraging. people ADHD focus issues
attentional issues, can effective. people don't, can also effective.
Again, places brain body state readiness idea
move particular actions, bring closer goal. haven't yet talked
set goals assess progress. simply pursue goals.
visual component important, fact, argue visual system
harnessing visual attention narrow point, going effective way,
get brain body mode action, pursue whatever goal
trying pursue. practice stark contrast multitasking, definition

effective getting system somewhat increased level activation,
can pursue focused goal. visual attention particular point,
going effective way bring system



00:54:40 Tool 3: Use Aged Self-Images Self-Motivate

state readiness action goal pursuit. another really interesting
way, can leverage visual system toward long-term goals. Balcetis Lab
also done, really interesting experiments, looking people's ability set
stick long-term goals. long-term goal looked at, one related
saving money later life. something lot people struggle with, lot
people hard time investing money saving money later life. Simply
human beings, vary extent worry going
happen later. also phenomenon so-called, delay discounting. Delay
discounting, fact goals, become less rewarding exist
future. may experienced walking past donut shop. love donuts
just going admit it, spot. love smell them. love
taste them. try eat 'cause told not good indeed,
don't think are. occasionally cave eat one many. general, try not
cave immediately rewarding properties smell taste donut.
But, know smell donut smell wonderful piece food,
immediate term, brings level focus, mental focus immediate
phase. feels rewarding, like now, just good.
actually extend reward tomorrow next thing think, today
happens Saturday, recording, but, Tuesday morning, going
get donut. doesn't value reward system, doesn't work
well long-term goals. not salient. not tangible, goal, especially
something like donut. Whereas kinds goals work, place
longer term can create heightened sense motivation, tend things
much rewarding us. delay discounting simply says that,
time given goal is, less effective reward will motivating one's
behavior. indeed see saving money retirement, see
sorts long-term investment, Balcetis Lab, therefore experiment,
looked people's tendency save money later life. groups
created study, really interesting. one group, imagine,
like 30 40 years older. invest certain amount money,
according whatever thought need. measured
amount set aside saved later life. group, actually


viewed photos themselves, picture, images artificially,
digitally aged, see 30 40 years future.
turns people second group, simply perceiving image,
future, invested far money later life. set aside money. Somehow
bridged gap immediate experience life longer arc toward
going like 30 40 years. powerful result opinion,
says again, visual perception future visual
perception present, allows us anchor goal directed systems
motivation take things immediate term might not seem useful. So,
can imagine sorts variations this. can imagine every time want

setting aside money retirement. investing one's health practices.
indeed study looked people will invest exercise healthy
eating. just think future might like future versus
seeing images future, go healthy
unhealthy route. again, point visual system, see, principally
important defining immediate term. Even see relates
something far off distance. think phenomenal studies get right
important issue kicked around

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal

recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual

use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards

Well, turns out, neural circuit. neural circuit, simply collection brain areas,
active particular sequence give rise particular behavior perception.
instance, feel happy, not brain area,
happy brain area, electrically active. Rather, going involve numerous brain


areas, active concert different degrees. way, keys
piano, together, played appropriate sequence, represent particular song.
never say one key piano represents song, key
necessary. Similarly, brain, can say brain area might necessary,
not sufficient give us particular experience generate particular behavior.
think goal seeking pursuit goals kind brain,
doesn't matter goal is. involves common set neural circuits
neural circuit like orient us toward today. will return times,
involves learning couple names, don't worry much
memorizing these. Just important understand logic put together
will explain make clear. want learn names, great.
One brain areas so-called, amygdala. amygdala often
associated fear, might say, wow, involved goal directed
behavior? Well, lot goal directed behavior, avoid punishments, including
things like embarrassment financial ruin things sort. amygdala
sense anxiety fear, actually built circuits generate goal
seeking motivation pursuit goals. areas so-called, ventral
striatum. striatum part called, basal ganglia. basal ganglia,
neural circuit, can simply described neural circuit helps us
generate go, meaning initiation action no-go, prevention action type
scenarios. Let make even simpler. ventral striatum part thing
called, basal ganglia. basal ganglia sort two circuits within it. One circuit
involved getting us things, like going get tomorrow going
run five miles first thing morning. don't know actually going that,
just using example. Another circuit within basal ganglia, no-go
circuit, one says, no, not going go second cookie third
cookie. not going eat that. go circuit one
responsible instead eating something else. Okay, go no-go circuits
within basal ganglia. got amygdala, think kind fear
anxiety avoidance. got, basal ganglia, initiating action
preventing action. so-called, cortex. cortex outer shell
brain, two sub regions cortex, involved goal-directed
behavior. One lateral prefrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex involved in, so-called,
executive function, things like planning. Thinking things different timescales,


not just want immediate term, might want tomorrow
next day actions currently going relate, future. so-
called, orbitofrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex large number functions, one
key functions orbitofrontal cortex, involved meshing emotionality
current state progress comparing emotionality might be,
closer goal. So, basically four areas, one involved anxiety,
one involved emotion, one involved planning another involved go, no-go
action. bunch detail, wanted make really simple everyone,
say four areas. One area associated anxiety fear,
amygdala. second involved action inaction, remember go, no-go,
basal ganglia. one involved planning thinking across
different timescales, lateral prefrontal cortex. fourth one,
involved emotionality, sit emotionally present, compared think
will emotionally, reach particular goal orbitofrontal
cortex. Again, don't need know names. don't need know
details, just understand different elements involved decision-making
processes lead us toward particular goals us update goal seeking, et
cetera. One key thing doesn't matter goal is, circuits involved.

00:30:29 Peripersonal Space vs. Extrapersonal Space

allowing reach goals, quickly indeed less effort. fact,
start tool now move information, want
make sure people coming away practical things can
implement. indeed, things can even course listening
watching podcast. first thing do, understand difference
peripersonal space extra personal space. Peripersonal space, space,
literally, within inside body, surface skin immediate
environment. Peripersonal space, key concept neuroscience
particular neural circuits particular chemicals, geared toward,
called consummatory behaviors, meaning, using things consuming things
enjoying things, immediate peripersonal space. Let give
example myself, just make concrete. can imagine similar examples
right now. Within current peripersonal space, interoception,
understanding perception internal body. So, quickly breathing, heart
rate, feelings surface skin, et cetera. also, within confines
peripersonal space, coffee mug, listening this, can't see this,
lifting coffee mug, going take sip coffee. consummatory
behavior, coffee, don't much motivate much get it.
things here, pens computer, et cetera. things peripersonal space
consuming things, generally governed set neurochemicals,
center around neuromodulator serotonin. others well, things
like oxytocin, mainly serotonin. Contrast that, so-called, extra personal

associated kind thinking about, anything extra personal space,
distinct neurochemicals neuromodulators, involved thinking

things beyond confines skin skin, dopamine. vitally
important concept understand, setting goals seeking goals.
good goal seeking, good setting goals assessing goals,


achieve goals, able toggle back forth clear

conceive this, evaluate progress peripersonal space.
evaluate feel, pursuit, even haven't initiated pursuit yet.
feel particular goal, truly feeling experience
now, even though goal future. going evaluate whether not,
made progress today yesterday not, evaluation feel

thinking towards extra personal space. go today's episode,
going teach technique rather neuroscience-based tool, will allow
continually transition back forth peripersonal space extra
personal space way will allow update evaluate better execute
goal seeking. whole principle behind this, human beings, like
animals, make evaluations whether not right track.
However, important thing understand, humans particular can
different timescales. don't just pursue food 'cause hungry, pursue food,
excuse me, particular meal, might people tomorrow. can
modulate timescale way animals don't. adjust goal
seeking, different timescales. addition that, humans exquisitely good
biasing behavior toward particular goals long periods time.

state readiness action goal pursuit. another really interesting
way, can leverage visual system toward long-term goals. Balcetis Lab
also done, really interesting experiments, looking people's ability set
stick long-term goals. long-term goal looked at, one related
saving money later life. something lot people struggle with, lot
people hard time investing money saving money later life. Simply
human beings, vary extent worry going
happen later. also phenomenon so-called, delay discounting. Delay
discounting, fact goals, become less rewarding exist
future. may experienced walking past donut shop. love donuts
just going admit it, spot. love smell them. love
taste them. try eat 'cause told not good indeed,
don't think are. occasionally cave eat one many. general, try not
cave immediately rewarding properties smell taste donut.
But, know smell donut smell wonderful piece food,
immediate term, brings level focus, mental focus immediate
phase. feels rewarding, like now, just good.
actually extend reward tomorrow next thing think, today
happens Saturday, recording, but, Tuesday morning, going
get donut. doesn't value reward system, doesn't work
well long-term goals. not salient. not tangible, goal, especially
something like donut. Whereas kinds goals work, place
longer term can create heightened sense motivation, tend things
much rewarding us. delay discounting simply says that,
time given goal is, less effective reward will motivating one's
behavior. indeed see saving money retirement, see
sorts long-term investment, Balcetis Lab, therefore experiment,
looked people's tendency save money later life. groups
created study, really interesting. one group, imagine,
like 30 40 years older. invest certain amount money,
according whatever thought need. measured
amount set aside saved later life. group, actually


viewed photos themselves, picture, images artificially,
digitally aged, see 30 40 years future.
turns people second group, simply perceiving image,
future, invested far money later life. set aside money. Somehow
bridged gap immediate experience life longer arc toward
going like 30 40 years. powerful result opinion,
says again, visual perception future visual
perception present, allows us anchor goal directed systems
motivation take things immediate term might not seem useful. So,
can imagine sorts variations this. can imagine every time want
donut, see vision actual physical picture consequence

necessarily need not motivated eat donuts,
confess, somebody think pretty good managing resources. think

setting aside money retirement. investing one's health practices.
indeed study looked people will invest exercise healthy
eating. just think future might like future versus
seeing images future, go healthy
unhealthy route. again, point visual system, see, principally
important defining immediate term. Even see relates
something far off distance. think phenomenal studies get right
important issue kicked around

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal

recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual

use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow

One brain areas so-called, amygdala. amygdala often
associated fear, might say, wow, involved goal directed
behavior? Well, lot goal directed behavior, avoid punishments, including
things like embarrassment financial ruin things sort. amygdala
sense anxiety fear, actually built circuits generate goal
seeking motivation pursuit goals. areas so-called, ventral
striatum. striatum part called, basal ganglia. basal ganglia,
neural circuit, can simply described neural circuit helps us
generate go, meaning initiation action no-go, prevention action type
scenarios. Let make even simpler. ventral striatum part thing
called, basal ganglia. basal ganglia sort two circuits within it. One circuit
involved getting us things, like going get tomorrow going
run five miles first thing morning. don't know actually going that,
just using example. Another circuit within basal ganglia, no-go
circuit, one says, no, not going go second cookie third
cookie. not going eat that. go circuit one
responsible instead eating something else. Okay, go no-go circuits
within basal ganglia. got amygdala, think kind fear
anxiety avoidance. got, basal ganglia, initiating action
preventing action. so-called, cortex. cortex outer shell
brain, two sub regions cortex, involved goal-directed
behavior. One lateral prefrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex involved in, so-called,
executive function, things like planning. Thinking things different timescales,


not just want immediate term, might want tomorrow
next day actions currently going relate, future. so-
called, orbitofrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex large number functions, one
key functions orbitofrontal cortex, involved meshing emotionality
current state progress comparing emotionality might be,
closer goal. So, basically four areas, one involved anxiety,
one involved emotion, one involved planning another involved go, no-go
action. bunch detail, wanted make really simple everyone,
say four areas. One area associated anxiety fear,
amygdala. second involved action inaction, remember go, no-go,
basal ganglia. one involved planning thinking across
different timescales, lateral prefrontal cortex. fourth one,
involved emotionality, sit emotionally present, compared think
will emotionally, reach particular goal orbitofrontal

00:30:29 Peripersonal Space vs. Extrapersonal Space

allowing reach goals, quickly indeed less effort. fact,
start tool now move information, want
make sure people coming away practical things can
implement. indeed, things can even course listening
watching podcast. first thing do, understand difference
peripersonal space extra personal space. Peripersonal space, space,
literally, within inside body, surface skin immediate
environment. Peripersonal space, key concept neuroscience
particular neural circuits particular chemicals, geared toward,
called consummatory behaviors, meaning, using things consuming things
enjoying things, immediate peripersonal space. Let give
example myself, just make concrete. can imagine similar examples
right now. Within current peripersonal space, interoception,
understanding perception internal body. So, quickly breathing, heart
rate, feelings surface skin, et cetera. also, within confines
peripersonal space, coffee mug, listening this, can't see this,
lifting coffee mug, going take sip coffee. consummatory
behavior, coffee, don't much motivate much get it.
things here, pens computer, et cetera. things peripersonal space
consuming things, generally governed set neurochemicals,
center around neuromodulator serotonin. others well, things
like oxytocin, mainly serotonin. Contrast that, so-called, extra personal

things beyond confines skin skin, dopamine. vitally
important concept understand, setting goals seeking goals.
good goal seeking, good setting goals assessing goals,


achieve goals, able toggle back forth clear
understanding peripersonal space, feel

conceive this, evaluate progress peripersonal space.
evaluate feel, pursuit, even haven't initiated pursuit yet.
feel particular goal, truly feeling experience
now, even though goal future. going evaluate whether not,
made progress today yesterday not, evaluation feel
immediate peripersonal space. However, moving toward goal, involves orienting
thinking towards extra personal space. go today's episode,
going teach technique rather neuroscience-based tool, will allow
continually transition back forth peripersonal space extra
personal space way will allow update evaluate better execute
goal seeking. whole principle behind this, human beings, like
animals, make evaluations whether not right track.
However, important thing understand, humans particular can
different timescales. don't just pursue food 'cause hungry, pursue food,
excuse me, particular meal, might people tomorrow. can
modulate timescale way animals don't. adjust goal
seeking, different timescales. addition that, humans exquisitely good
biasing behavior toward particular goals long periods time.

donut, see vision actual physical picture consequence
eaten many donuts every day next 10 years. don't know
image look like 'cause never seen it. not experiment
necessarily need not motivated eat donuts,
confess, somebody think pretty good managing resources. think
see image 70 75, many things associated
visual images. Like body must feel like, needs probably going
like state age. sorts things may may not still able
age. anchors back immediate goal-directed behaviors,
setting aside money retirement. investing one's health practices.
indeed study looked people will invest exercise healthy
eating. just think future might like future versus
seeing images future, go healthy
unhealthy route. again, point visual system, see, principally
important defining immediate term. Even see relates
something far off distance. think phenomenal studies get right
important issue kicked around

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far

kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details

this, focused particular point visual space particular goal

extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual

use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique

tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual

particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly

never say one key piano represents song, key
necessary. Similarly, brain, can say brain area might necessary,
not sufficient give us particular experience generate particular behavior.
think goal seeking pursuit goals kind brain,
doesn't matter goal is. involves common set neural circuits
neural circuit like orient us toward today. will return times,
involves learning couple names, don't worry much
memorizing these. Just important understand logic put together
will explain make clear. want learn names, great.
One brain areas so-called, amygdala. amygdala often
associated fear, might say, wow, involved goal directed
behavior? Well, lot goal directed behavior, avoid punishments, including
things like embarrassment financial ruin things sort. amygdala
sense anxiety fear, actually built circuits generate goal
seeking motivation pursuit goals. areas so-called, ventral
striatum. striatum part called, basal ganglia. basal ganglia,
neural circuit, can simply described neural circuit helps us
generate go, meaning initiation action no-go, prevention action type
scenarios. Let make even simpler. ventral striatum part thing
called, basal ganglia. basal ganglia sort two circuits within it. One circuit
involved getting us things, like going get tomorrow going
run five miles first thing morning. don't know actually going that,
just using example. Another circuit within basal ganglia, no-go
circuit, one says, no, not going go second cookie third
cookie. not going eat that. go circuit one
responsible instead eating something else. Okay, go no-go circuits
within basal ganglia. got amygdala, think kind fear
anxiety avoidance. got, basal ganglia, initiating action
preventing action. so-called, cortex. cortex outer shell
brain, two sub regions cortex, involved goal-directed
behavior. One lateral prefrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex involved in, so-called,
executive function, things like planning. Thinking things different timescales,


not just want immediate term, might want tomorrow
next day actions currently going relate, future. so-
called, orbitofrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex large number functions, one
key functions orbitofrontal cortex, involved meshing emotionality
current state progress comparing emotionality might be,
closer goal. So, basically four areas, one involved anxiety,
one involved emotion, one involved planning another involved go, no-go
action. bunch detail, wanted make really simple everyone,
say four areas. One area associated anxiety fear,
amygdala. second involved action inaction, remember go, no-go,
basal ganglia. one involved planning thinking across
different timescales, lateral prefrontal cortex. fourth one,
involved emotionality, sit emotionally present, compared think
will emotionally, reach particular goal orbitofrontal
cortex. Again, don't need know names. don't need know
details, just understand different elements involved decision-making
processes lead us toward particular goals us update goal seeking, et
cetera. One key thing doesn't matter goal is, circuits involved.

00:30:29 Peripersonal Space vs. Extrapersonal Space

allowing reach goals, quickly indeed less effort. fact,
start tool now move information, want
make sure people coming away practical things can
implement. indeed, things can even course listening
watching podcast. first thing do, understand difference
peripersonal space extra personal space. Peripersonal space, space,
literally, within inside body, surface skin immediate
environment. Peripersonal space, key concept neuroscience
particular neural circuits particular chemicals, geared toward,
called consummatory behaviors, meaning, using things consuming things
enjoying things, immediate peripersonal space. Let give
example myself, just make concrete. can imagine similar examples
right now. Within current peripersonal space, interoception,
understanding perception internal body. So, quickly breathing, heart
rate, feelings surface skin, et cetera. also, within confines
peripersonal space, coffee mug, listening this, can't see this,
lifting coffee mug, going take sip coffee. consummatory
behavior, coffee, don't much motivate much get it.
things here, pens computer, et cetera. things peripersonal space
consuming things, generally governed set neurochemicals,
center around neuromodulator serotonin. others well, things
like oxytocin, mainly serotonin. Contrast that, so-called, extra personal
space. Extrapersonal space everything beyond confines reach.
something next room. will something street. will something
location, space time. neuromodulators neurochemicals,
associated kind thinking about, anything extra personal space,
distinct neurochemicals neuromodulators, involved thinking
making actions towards peripersonal space. molecule
associated thinking orienting toward extra personal space, again,
things beyond confines skin skin, dopamine. vitally
important concept understand, setting goals seeking goals.
good goal seeking, good setting goals assessing goals,


achieve goals, able toggle back forth clear
understanding peripersonal space, feel
immediate present. ability understand extra personal
space ability move extra personal space. simple way
conceive this, evaluate progress peripersonal space.
evaluate feel, pursuit, even haven't initiated pursuit yet.
feel particular goal, truly feeling experience
now, even though goal future. going evaluate whether not,
made progress today yesterday not, evaluation feel
immediate peripersonal space. However, moving toward goal, involves orienting
thinking towards extra personal space. go today's episode,
going teach technique rather neuroscience-based tool, will allow
continually transition back forth peripersonal space extra
personal space way will allow update evaluate better execute
goal seeking. whole principle behind this, human beings, like
animals, make evaluations whether not right track.
However, important thing understand, humans particular can
different timescales. don't just pursue food 'cause hungry, pursue food,
excuse me, particular meal, might people tomorrow. can
modulate timescale way animals don't. adjust goal
seeking, different timescales. addition that, humans exquisitely good
biasing behavior toward particular goals long periods time.
lot mistakes there, fact, things outright wrong literature
particular, internet, kind wellness fitness cognitive fitness

minutes. things like visualization, visualization visualization big

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely

again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals

less conceptually can useful. moved literature,
started see redundant themes. attempted do, distill
redundant themes, regardless person teaching scientific laboratory

understanding basic elements common goals. Now, modern
science modern psychological science trying understand goal setting
pursuit, actually dates back 1930s. sure members
species, focused goal setting goal pursuit, long scientific
literature emerged. just stands reason that, since human brain hasn't evolved
much, don't think, last 10,000 years, people thinking

00:30:29 Peripersonal Space vs. Extrapersonal Space

allowing reach goals, quickly indeed less effort. fact,
start tool now move information, want
make sure people coming away practical things can
implement. indeed, things can even course listening
watching podcast. first thing do, understand difference
peripersonal space extra personal space. Peripersonal space, space,
literally, within inside body, surface skin immediate
environment. Peripersonal space, key concept neuroscience
particular neural circuits particular chemicals, geared toward,
called consummatory behaviors, meaning, using things consuming things
enjoying things, immediate peripersonal space. Let give
example myself, just make concrete. can imagine similar examples
right now. Within current peripersonal space, interoception,
understanding perception internal body. So, quickly breathing, heart
rate, feelings surface skin, et cetera. also, within confines
peripersonal space, coffee mug, listening this, can't see this,
lifting coffee mug, going take sip coffee. consummatory
behavior, coffee, don't much motivate much get it.
things here, pens computer, et cetera. things peripersonal space
consuming things, generally governed set neurochemicals,
center around neuromodulator serotonin. others well, things
like oxytocin, mainly serotonin. Contrast that, so-called, extra personal
space. Extrapersonal space everything beyond confines reach.

associated kind thinking about, anything extra personal space,
distinct neurochemicals neuromodulators, involved thinking
making actions towards peripersonal space. molecule

things beyond confines skin skin, dopamine. vitally
important concept understand, setting goals seeking goals.
good goal seeking, good setting goals assessing goals,

feel particular goal, truly feeling experience
now, even though goal future. going evaluate whether not,

thinking towards extra personal space. go today's episode,
going teach technique rather neuroscience-based tool, will allow
continually transition back forth peripersonal space extra
personal space way will allow update evaluate better execute
goal seeking. whole principle behind this, human beings, like
animals, make evaluations whether not right track.
However, important thing understand, humans particular can
different timescales. don't just pursue food 'cause hungry, pursue food,
excuse me, particular meal, might people tomorrow. can
modulate timescale way animals don't. adjust goal
seeking, different timescales. addition that, humans exquisitely good

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win

time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big

specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

01:39:50 Tool 9: Space-Time Bridging



regulating dopamine system. want sure include tool,
especially powerful me, grounded neuroscience research
psychology research. describe tool next, think see ways
measures nicely work Emily Balcetis colleagues done.
something that, personally many years, based understanding
visual system understanding indeed can move cognition

accessible us. can shift mode mode exteroception
focusing things outside confines skin beyond reach,
literally goal directed behaviors goal directed thoughts. something
past, talked little bit talked something called,
space-time bridging. haven't talked much time domain visual

three breaths again, focusing internal state, now splitting
little bit attention interoception exteroception. focusing something
outside me, ratio split attention 90, 10, 90% attention
focused internally, also focusing attention externally. people
can pretty easily. Then, third, call, station. now move visual

much attention, outside myself, maintaining just little bit internal state,
can measure cadence three breaths. move visual attention

point, trying best move 99, not 100% attention external

before, not focusing particular location horizon. trying
dilate aperture field view, can see much visual landscape
possible. internal, excuse me, indoors, might

said three, one 10. doesn't really matter. Or, also going
depend on, instance, slowly breathing. 'Cause breathing might

bridging? useful goal setting? reason call space-time bridging,
visual system, not just analyzing space. actually batch

carving time, according immediate physiological experience. Whereas
focus visual attention outside body, not engage

focus visual system broader sphere space space beyond

then, course updating goals, need update goals.
enormously confusing batch challenges, think once,
break elements, visual system can help find

hear say again, episode, value information goal
key. why, basically one neuro-transmitter rather neuromodulator
system, governs goal setting, goal assessment goal pursuit.
neuromodulator dopamine. Dopamine common currency assess
progress toward particular things particular value. fact, dopamine, way
assess value pursuits. so, take moment shift
attention, psychology goal setting. things probably heard bit
about, sorts goals good set goals

00:24:33 Psychology Goal Setting: Assessing Value, Action Steps

execute goals effectively, using neuroscience circuits just
described understanding neuromodulator dopamine. take look
psychology goal setting goal pursuit. enormous literature, meaning
tens thousands, not hundreds thousands scientific papers
topic goal setting goal pursuit. also lot information internet
goal pursuit. looking information, one comes appreciate pretty
quickly, acronyms big thing. Acronyms, seem dominate area goal
setting, especially relates things business sector, also
relationship sector. Now, acronyms wonderful, allow us organize thinking


less conceptually can useful. moved literature,
started see redundant themes. attempted do, distill
redundant themes, regardless person teaching scientific laboratory
happened come acronyms, boil common

understanding basic elements common goals. Now, modern
science modern psychological science trying understand goal setting
pursuit, actually dates back 1930s. sure members
species, focused goal setting goal pursuit, long scientific
literature emerged. just stands reason that, since human brain hasn't evolved
much, don't think, last 10,000 years, people thinking
things. just didn't get papers, evaluate
PubMed forth, now can, can look papers.
find acronyms abound psychology literature goal setting goal
pursuit. instance, hear work Larkin Small, instance,
last names various researchers. so-called, ABC method, goal
achievable, believable, person committed. sort
obvious hear ABC method. people came along
expanded that, talked so-called, SMART method. SMART
another acronym, specific, goal measurable, goal
attainable, goal realistic time-bound, meaning set
certain period time given goal performed. people come
along modify these, way psychology research done. not
laughing it. just chuckling because, seems like acronyms get longer

say sport, understand path is. big goal
course, broken series smaller goals, whole thing starts
thinking end mind. minutes, will talk about, whether not
visualization end mind, actually beneficial detrimental achieving goals.
actually great neuroscience psychology data now. So, mentioned
acronyms, not attempt disparage them. think wonderful.
mentioned psychology literature, not attempt disparage it, rather just
say that, goal setting first step, assessment whether not one making
progress towards goals second necessary step.
business goal execution. brings us back neural circuit components,
remember, neural circuit, involving four things earlier, amygdala, striatum,
orbitofrontal cortex prefrontal cortex. work together, divide whole
process mentioned before, two general categories. first is, assessing value,
knowing whether not one one given moment, relates external
thing. things going well things going poorly? knowing gauge
accurately. then, action steps, goes no goes, this, less that,
this, don't that, et cetera. So, now going shift back neuroscience
going talk practical applications information just described.
given lot kind academic information. this, like
keep mind, things either accomplished
like accomplish going forward? this, can build toward set
protocols, end, able quickly plug in, particular goals
route particular goals, grounded science. think going

00:30:29 Peripersonal Space vs. Extrapersonal Space

allowing reach goals, quickly indeed less effort. fact,
start tool now move information, want
make sure people coming away practical things can
implement. indeed, things can even course listening
watching podcast. first thing do, understand difference
peripersonal space extra personal space. Peripersonal space, space,
literally, within inside body, surface skin immediate
environment. Peripersonal space, key concept neuroscience
particular neural circuits particular chemicals, geared toward,
called consummatory behaviors, meaning, using things consuming things
enjoying things, immediate peripersonal space. Let give
example myself, just make concrete. can imagine similar examples
right now. Within current peripersonal space, interoception,
understanding perception internal body. So, quickly breathing, heart
rate, feelings surface skin, et cetera. also, within confines
peripersonal space, coffee mug, listening this, can't see this,
lifting coffee mug, going take sip coffee. consummatory
behavior, coffee, don't much motivate much get it.
things here, pens computer, et cetera. things peripersonal space
consuming things, generally governed set neurochemicals,
center around neuromodulator serotonin. others well, things
like oxytocin, mainly serotonin. Contrast that, so-called, extra personal
space. Extrapersonal space everything beyond confines reach.
something next room. will something street. will something
location, space time. neuromodulators neurochemicals,
associated kind thinking about, anything extra personal space,
distinct neurochemicals neuromodulators, involved thinking
making actions towards peripersonal space. molecule
associated thinking orienting toward extra personal space, again,
things beyond confines skin skin, dopamine. vitally
important concept understand, setting goals seeking goals.
good goal seeking, good setting goals assessing goals,


achieve goals, able toggle back forth clear
understanding peripersonal space, feel
immediate present. ability understand extra personal
space ability move extra personal space. simple way
conceive this, evaluate progress peripersonal space.
evaluate feel, pursuit, even haven't initiated pursuit yet.
feel particular goal, truly feeling experience
now, even though goal future. going evaluate whether not,
made progress today yesterday not, evaluation feel
immediate peripersonal space. However, moving toward goal, involves orienting
thinking towards extra personal space. go today's episode,
going teach technique rather neuroscience-based tool, will allow
continually transition back forth peripersonal space extra
personal space way will allow update evaluate better execute
goal seeking. whole principle behind this, human beings, like
animals, make evaluations whether not right track.
However, important thing understand, humans particular can
different timescales. don't just pursue food 'cause hungry, pursue food,
excuse me, particular meal, might people tomorrow. can
modulate timescale way animals don't. adjust goal
seeking, different timescales. addition that, humans exquisitely good
biasing behavior toward particular goals long periods time.
lot mistakes there, fact, things outright wrong literature
particular, internet, kind wellness fitness cognitive fitness
space, send people wrong path things will talk
minutes. things like visualization, visualization visualization big
goal, best way achieve goals.

00:35:39 Visually Focusing Goal Line Improves Performance

fact, not case, much approach this. now like
shift gears towards talking things, people get badly wrong
setting assessing executing goals. based peer reviewed research,
think solid. know solid. runs counter many us


taught. start simple one. heard multitasking bad.
heard multitasking bad, doesn't allow focus. want achieve
anything, want accomplish anything, not multitask. Well, turns out,
wrong. turns role multitasking, multitasking
placed particular time within goal seeking behavior order effective.
Really nice studies done Carnegie Mellon University, Davis Lab, evaluated
long people able focus different environments. long able
stay concentrated work. turns number exceedingly low. turns
people, whether not computer work whether not
writing accounting work anything sort, can hold attention
three minutes time shift attention off.
ridiculously low first hear it, but, probably reflects basic state brain
function. hearkens back time hunter gatherers, doubt
maintaining focus solidly hours hours hours, unless
particular threat particular crisis. Rather, imagine people
collected seeds nuts berries three minutes probably stood
up, looked around kept going. hunting animals
sort pursuit, fishing, et cetera, focused, focused, focused every three minutes
so, might've looked and, know, take look sky looked around
make sure people not there, et cetera. stands reason
will case. Again, neural circuits haven't evolved much. Now,
multitasking, shown interesting physiological signature,
multitask, jump back forth things, increase
level neurotransmitter, also sometimes called neuromodulator, basically
thing sake discussion. increase neurotransmitter
epinephrine, adrenaline. so, really nice studies now, pointing
fact bit multitasking prior, jumping focused, goal directed
behavior, whether not mental behavior physical behavior, can actually useful
gets us action. told multitasking terrible,
you, instance, find cleaning house also checking phone
number things, right point sitting write
focused work. probably reflects adaptive mechanism, use

particular feature blood pressure. Now body has, course, arteries, veins

components vascular system. so-called, blood pressure. Blood
pressure just much, fluid volume pressing arteries, veins

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk

weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever

interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great

business goal execution. brings us back neural circuit components,
remember, neural circuit, involving four things earlier, amygdala, striatum,
orbitofrontal cortex prefrontal cortex. work together, divide whole
process mentioned before, two general categories. first is, assessing value,
knowing whether not one one given moment, relates external

00:30:29 Peripersonal Space vs. Extrapersonal Space

allowing reach goals, quickly indeed less effort. fact,
start tool now move information, want
make sure people coming away practical things can
implement. indeed, things can even course listening
watching podcast. first thing do, understand difference
peripersonal space extra personal space. Peripersonal space, space,
literally, within inside body, surface skin immediate
environment. Peripersonal space, key concept neuroscience
particular neural circuits particular chemicals, geared toward,
called consummatory behaviors, meaning, using things consuming things
enjoying things, immediate peripersonal space. Let give
example myself, just make concrete. can imagine similar examples
right now. Within current peripersonal space, interoception,
understanding perception internal body. So, quickly breathing, heart
rate, feelings surface skin, et cetera. also, within confines
peripersonal space, coffee mug, listening this, can't see this,
lifting coffee mug, going take sip coffee. consummatory
behavior, coffee, don't much motivate much get it.
things here, pens computer, et cetera. things peripersonal space
consuming things, generally governed set neurochemicals,
center around neuromodulator serotonin. others well, things
like oxytocin, mainly serotonin. Contrast that, so-called, extra personal
space. Extrapersonal space everything beyond confines reach.
something next room. will something street. will something
location, space time. neuromodulators neurochemicals,
associated kind thinking about, anything extra personal space,
distinct neurochemicals neuromodulators, involved thinking
making actions towards peripersonal space. molecule
associated thinking orienting toward extra personal space, again,
things beyond confines skin skin, dopamine. vitally
important concept understand, setting goals seeking goals.
good goal seeking, good setting goals assessing goals,


achieve goals, able toggle back forth clear
understanding peripersonal space, feel
immediate present. ability understand extra personal
space ability move extra personal space. simple way
conceive this, evaluate progress peripersonal space.
evaluate feel, pursuit, even haven't initiated pursuit yet.
feel particular goal, truly feeling experience
now, even though goal future. going evaluate whether not,
made progress today yesterday not, evaluation feel
immediate peripersonal space. However, moving toward goal, involves orienting
thinking towards extra personal space. go today's episode,
going teach technique rather neuroscience-based tool, will allow
continually transition back forth peripersonal space extra
personal space way will allow update evaluate better execute
goal seeking. whole principle behind this, human beings, like
animals, make evaluations whether not right track.
However, important thing understand, humans particular can
different timescales. don't just pursue food 'cause hungry, pursue food,
excuse me, particular meal, might people tomorrow. can
modulate timescale way animals don't. adjust goal
seeking, different timescales. addition that, humans exquisitely good
biasing behavior toward particular goals long periods time.
lot mistakes there, fact, things outright wrong literature
particular, internet, kind wellness fitness cognitive fitness
space, send people wrong path things will talk
minutes. things like visualization, visualization visualization big
goal, best way achieve goals.

00:35:39 Visually Focusing Goal Line Improves Performance

fact, not case, much approach this. now like
shift gears towards talking things, people get badly wrong
setting assessing executing goals. based peer reviewed research,
think solid. know solid. runs counter many us


taught. start simple one. heard multitasking bad.
heard multitasking bad, doesn't allow focus. want achieve
anything, want accomplish anything, not multitask. Well, turns out,
wrong. turns role multitasking, multitasking
placed particular time within goal seeking behavior order effective.
Really nice studies done Carnegie Mellon University, Davis Lab, evaluated
long people able focus different environments. long able
stay concentrated work. turns number exceedingly low. turns
people, whether not computer work whether not
writing accounting work anything sort, can hold attention
three minutes time shift attention off.
ridiculously low first hear it, but, probably reflects basic state brain
function. hearkens back time hunter gatherers, doubt
maintaining focus solidly hours hours hours, unless
particular threat particular crisis. Rather, imagine people
collected seeds nuts berries three minutes probably stood
up, looked around kept going. hunting animals
sort pursuit, fishing, et cetera, focused, focused, focused every three minutes
so, might've looked and, know, take look sky looked around
make sure people not there, et cetera. stands reason
will case. Again, neural circuits haven't evolved much. Now,
multitasking, shown interesting physiological signature,
multitask, jump back forth things, increase
level neurotransmitter, also sometimes called neuromodulator, basically
thing sake discussion. increase neurotransmitter
epinephrine, adrenaline. so, really nice studies now, pointing
fact bit multitasking prior, jumping focused, goal directed
behavior, whether not mental behavior physical behavior, can actually useful
gets us action. told multitasking terrible,
you, instance, find cleaning house also checking phone
number things, right point sitting write
focused work. probably reflects adaptive mechanism, use
action somewhat varied multitasking action order generate adrenaline
system, adrenaline just gets action. Now, great, but, don't


want multitask throughout kind goal seeking goal pursuit behavior. Because,
also clear going talk exquisite depth today,
visual focus particular contracting visual window, bringing aperture
see, fine point, can absolutely increase clarity goal seeking
likelihood will pursue goals. talked little bit

hold gaze location best can, can increase level cognitive
attention ability focus stay focused. not magic.
consequence fact, cognition follows visual perception.
low vision no vision, meaning blind, trouble
seeing, lab lot work people, low vision, no vision. tend
use auditory system, hearing, way anchor attention particular
things. people can see see pretty well visual focus way
that. Now, earlier, talking notion peripersonal space versus

had, people focus visual attention goal line sort
engage sort behavior, requires lot effort. done lot
different experiments like this, just explain one. always include control
group, people go physical effort mental effort,
don't focus attention just one location. long short studies
that, people focus attention one location, like goal line,


much effective reaching goals achieve
perception, expended less effort. give example one particularly
nice study Balcetis Lab. particular study involves, physical exercise.
Although, mentioned before, done similar studies looking cognitive type
work. group people, exercise, wearing 15 pound ankle
weights, basically move certain distance run certain distance
reach goal line. One group focused goal line, visually focused, goal
line. group not told visually focus goal line. found,
group focused goal line, able achieve reaching goal
17% less effort. measured effort got 23% quicker.
remarkable difference. distance traveled, workload
everyone's wearing 15 pound weights ankles. One group simply
looking goal line, group not told look goal line, simply
looking goal line, something psychology end physiology
people, allows move forward less perceived effort
quickly. remarkable. case, focused goal line,
moments, talk one can use updating goal line, incremental goal
line. Starting intermediate goal, extending goal line
further. just sit back second think that, just changing
person looks, changed perceived effort ability something,
effectively, quickly, group not deliberately focusing visual

prepare us readiness action, prepare us resting relaxing.
special focusing one's visual attention given location? Well, turns
two branches visual system. visual information comes
eyes, can head two different pathways. One pathway
engaged vision brought common point, call, vergence eye
movement. focusing intensely given point, regardless far


away us point is, visual system engages certain set neurons, neural
circuits involved resolving fine detail can evaluate small changes
small periods time. Just think detailed camera visual world.
tends restricted. pathway visual system, so-
called, magnocellular pathway. pathway involved taking global

visual system, accomplishes increase alertness communicating
circulatory system system delivers blood nutrients oxygen
rest tissues body. talk second focusing vision
particular location study Balcetis Lab,
found was, focusing goal line allows people, move effectively toward
goal. something can leverage aspects goal pursuits.
happens focus particular location? Believe not, increase
particular feature blood pressure. Now body has, course, arteries, veins
capillaries, heart pumps blood, first arteries,
components vascular system. so-called, blood pressure. Blood
pressure just much, fluid volume pressing arteries, veins
capillaries. can imagine pipe little fluid moving it, low
pressure. pipe lot fluid moving it, even
pressure. pipe lot viscous, meaning, kind sticky, thick
stuff, moving forward, even pressure. blood pressure
probably blood pressure measured. always two numbers.
top number, systolic blood pressure. bottom number,
line, diastolic pressure. important thing understand,
blood pressure will rise heart beats, fluid


moving pipes arteries veins capillaries.
top number called systole systolic blood pressure,
pressure time, heart contracts. top number, normally,
healthy blood pressure, somewhere range 90 120 millimeters
mercury. Millimeters mercury just way, pressure measured. top
number, systole, systolic blood pressure, measured
heart contracts. So, amount pressure heartbeat
moving vasculature. Now, beats, heartbeats,
relaxes, blood pressure going drop lower value fluid isn't
pumped system moments. bottom, diastolic
pressure. typically healthy people, going 60 80 millimeters
mercury. might hear normal blood pressure about, again,
approximate, 120 80. means is, point blood
pumped there, arteries veins, boom, 120 millimeters
mercury, then, heart relaxes second next beat,
drops 80. high pressure, low pressure, high pressure, low pressure.
fluid pumped system. Now, telling this? Well,
turns out, neural circuits link visual system focusing
particular point top number, systolic blood pressure. focus
eyes particular location, systolic blood pressure goes up,

also neurotransmitter systems, like epinephrine, will soon see dopamine,

remarkable feature physiology gets right point
psychological phenomenon talking earlier. just recall

now described psychology underlying physiology. Now,
like mesh within context actual specific goal setting goal pursuit.
many probably thinking is, well, physiology,
psychology, actually apply towards setting achieving
goals? Well, that, understanding mental frame attention
always either positioned, peripersonal space, focused immediate

state readiness action goal pursuit. another really interesting
way, can leverage visual system toward long-term goals. Balcetis Lab
also done, really interesting experiments, looking people's ability set
stick long-term goals. long-term goal looked at, one related
saving money later life. something lot people struggle with, lot
people hard time investing money saving money later life. Simply
human beings, vary extent worry going
happen later. also phenomenon so-called, delay discounting. Delay
discounting, fact goals, become less rewarding exist
future. may experienced walking past donut shop. love donuts
just going admit it, spot. love smell them. love
taste them. try eat 'cause told not good indeed,
don't think are. occasionally cave eat one many. general, try not
cave immediately rewarding properties smell taste donut.
But, know smell donut smell wonderful piece food,
immediate term, brings level focus, mental focus immediate
phase. feels rewarding, like now, just good.
actually extend reward tomorrow next thing think, today
happens Saturday, recording, but, Tuesday morning, going
get donut. doesn't value reward system, doesn't work
well long-term goals. not salient. not tangible, goal, especially
something like donut. Whereas kinds goals work, place
longer term can create heightened sense motivation, tend things
much rewarding us. delay discounting simply says that,
time given goal is, less effective reward will motivating one's
behavior. indeed see saving money retirement, see
sorts long-term investment, Balcetis Lab, therefore experiment,
looked people's tendency save money later life. groups
created study, really interesting. one group, imagine,
like 30 40 years older. invest certain amount money,
according whatever thought need. measured
amount set aside saved later life. group, actually


viewed photos themselves, picture, images artificially,
digitally aged, see 30 40 years future.
turns people second group, simply perceiving image,
future, invested far money later life. set aside money. Somehow
bridged gap immediate experience life longer arc toward
going like 30 40 years. powerful result opinion,
says again, visual perception future visual
perception present, allows us anchor goal directed systems
motivation take things immediate term might not seem useful. So,
can imagine sorts variations this. can imagine every time want
donut, see vision actual physical picture consequence
eaten many donuts every day next 10 years. don't know
image look like 'cause never seen it. not experiment
necessarily need not motivated eat donuts,
confess, somebody think pretty good managing resources. think
see image 70 75, many things associated
visual images. Like body must feel like, needs probably going
like state age. sorts things may may not still able
age. anchors back immediate goal-directed behaviors,
setting aside money retirement. investing one's health practices.
indeed study looked people will invest exercise healthy
eating. just think future might like future versus
seeing images future, go healthy
unhealthy route. again, point visual system, see, principally
important defining immediate term. Even see relates
something far off distance. think phenomenal studies get right
important issue kicked around

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far

kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal

extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual

use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique

tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual

particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards

00:30:29 Peripersonal Space vs. Extrapersonal Space

allowing reach goals, quickly indeed less effort. fact,
start tool now move information, want
make sure people coming away practical things can
implement. indeed, things can even course listening
watching podcast. first thing do, understand difference
peripersonal space extra personal space. Peripersonal space, space,
literally, within inside body, surface skin immediate
environment. Peripersonal space, key concept neuroscience
particular neural circuits particular chemicals, geared toward,
called consummatory behaviors, meaning, using things consuming things
enjoying things, immediate peripersonal space. Let give
example myself, just make concrete. can imagine similar examples
right now. Within current peripersonal space, interoception,
understanding perception internal body. So, quickly breathing, heart
rate, feelings surface skin, et cetera. also, within confines
peripersonal space, coffee mug, listening this, can't see this,
lifting coffee mug, going take sip coffee. consummatory
behavior, coffee, don't much motivate much get it.
things here, pens computer, et cetera. things peripersonal space
consuming things, generally governed set neurochemicals,
center around neuromodulator serotonin. others well, things
like oxytocin, mainly serotonin. Contrast that, so-called, extra personal
space. Extrapersonal space everything beyond confines reach.
something next room. will something street. will something

associated kind thinking about, anything extra personal space,
distinct neurochemicals neuromodulators, involved thinking
making actions towards peripersonal space. molecule
associated thinking orienting toward extra personal space, again,
things beyond confines skin skin, dopamine. vitally
important concept understand, setting goals seeking goals.
good goal seeking, good setting goals assessing goals,


achieve goals, able toggle back forth clear
understanding peripersonal space, feel
immediate present. ability understand extra personal
space ability move extra personal space. simple way
conceive this, evaluate progress peripersonal space.
evaluate feel, pursuit, even haven't initiated pursuit yet.
feel particular goal, truly feeling experience
now, even though goal future. going evaluate whether not,
made progress today yesterday not, evaluation feel
immediate peripersonal space. However, moving toward goal, involves orienting
thinking towards extra personal space. go today's episode,
going teach technique rather neuroscience-based tool, will allow
continually transition back forth peripersonal space extra
personal space way will allow update evaluate better execute
goal seeking. whole principle behind this, human beings, like
animals, make evaluations whether not right track.
However, important thing understand, humans particular can
different timescales. don't just pursue food 'cause hungry, pursue food,
excuse me, particular meal, might people tomorrow. can
modulate timescale way animals don't. adjust goal
seeking, different timescales. addition that, humans exquisitely good
biasing behavior toward particular goals long periods time.
lot mistakes there, fact, things outright wrong literature
particular, internet, kind wellness fitness cognitive fitness
space, send people wrong path things will talk
minutes. things like visualization, visualization visualization big
goal, best way achieve goals.

happens focus particular location? Believe not, increase
particular feature blood pressure. Now body has, course, arteries, veins
capillaries, heart pumps blood, first arteries,
components vascular system. so-called, blood pressure. Blood
pressure just much, fluid volume pressing arteries, veins
capillaries. can imagine pipe little fluid moving it, low

stuff, moving forward, even pressure. blood pressure
probably blood pressure measured. always two numbers.
top number, systolic blood pressure. bottom number,

blood pressure will rise heart beats, fluid


moving pipes arteries veins capillaries.
top number called systole systolic blood pressure,
pressure time, heart contracts. top number, normally,
healthy blood pressure, somewhere range 90 120 millimeters

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

01:39:50 Tool 9: Space-Time Bridging



regulating dopamine system. want sure include tool,
especially powerful me, grounded neuroscience research
psychology research. describe tool next, think see ways

00:30:29 Peripersonal Space vs. Extrapersonal Space

allowing reach goals, quickly indeed less effort. fact,
start tool now move information, want
make sure people coming away practical things can
implement. indeed, things can even course listening
watching podcast. first thing do, understand difference
peripersonal space extra personal space. Peripersonal space, space,
literally, within inside body, surface skin immediate
environment. Peripersonal space, key concept neuroscience
particular neural circuits particular chemicals, geared toward,
called consummatory behaviors, meaning, using things consuming things
enjoying things, immediate peripersonal space. Let give
example myself, just make concrete. can imagine similar examples
right now. Within current peripersonal space, interoception,
understanding perception internal body. So, quickly breathing, heart
rate, feelings surface skin, et cetera. also, within confines
peripersonal space, coffee mug, listening this, can't see this,
lifting coffee mug, going take sip coffee. consummatory
behavior, coffee, don't much motivate much get it.
things here, pens computer, et cetera. things peripersonal space
consuming things, generally governed set neurochemicals,
center around neuromodulator serotonin. others well, things
like oxytocin, mainly serotonin. Contrast that, so-called, extra personal
space. Extrapersonal space everything beyond confines reach.
something next room. will something street. will something
location, space time. neuromodulators neurochemicals,
associated kind thinking about, anything extra personal space,
distinct neurochemicals neuromodulators, involved thinking
making actions towards peripersonal space. molecule
associated thinking orienting toward extra personal space, again,
things beyond confines skin skin, dopamine. vitally
important concept understand, setting goals seeking goals.
good goal seeking, good setting goals assessing goals,


achieve goals, able toggle back forth clear
understanding peripersonal space, feel
immediate present. ability understand extra personal
space ability move extra personal space. simple way
conceive this, evaluate progress peripersonal space.
evaluate feel, pursuit, even haven't initiated pursuit yet.
feel particular goal, truly feeling experience
now, even though goal future. going evaluate whether not,
made progress today yesterday not, evaluation feel
immediate peripersonal space. However, moving toward goal, involves orienting
thinking towards extra personal space. go today's episode,
going teach technique rather neuroscience-based tool, will allow
continually transition back forth peripersonal space extra
personal space way will allow update evaluate better execute
goal seeking. whole principle behind this, human beings, like
animals, make evaluations whether not right track.
However, important thing understand, humans particular can
different timescales. don't just pursue food 'cause hungry, pursue food,
excuse me, particular meal, might people tomorrow. can
modulate timescale way animals don't. adjust goal
seeking, different timescales. addition that, humans exquisitely good
biasing behavior toward particular goals long periods time.
lot mistakes there, fact, things outright wrong literature
particular, internet, kind wellness fitness cognitive fitness
space, send people wrong path things will talk
minutes. things like visualization, visualization visualization big
goal, best way achieve goals.

00:35:39 Visually Focusing Goal Line Improves Performance

fact, not case, much approach this. now like
shift gears towards talking things, people get badly wrong
setting assessing executing goals. based peer reviewed research,
think solid. know solid. runs counter many us


taught. start simple one. heard multitasking bad.
heard multitasking bad, doesn't allow focus. want achieve
anything, want accomplish anything, not multitask. Well, turns out,
wrong. turns role multitasking, multitasking
placed particular time within goal seeking behavior order effective.
Really nice studies done Carnegie Mellon University, Davis Lab, evaluated
long people able focus different environments. long able
stay concentrated work. turns number exceedingly low. turns
people, whether not computer work whether not
writing accounting work anything sort, can hold attention
three minutes time shift attention off.
ridiculously low first hear it, but, probably reflects basic state brain
function. hearkens back time hunter gatherers, doubt
maintaining focus solidly hours hours hours, unless
particular threat particular crisis. Rather, imagine people
collected seeds nuts berries three minutes probably stood
up, looked around kept going. hunting animals
sort pursuit, fishing, et cetera, focused, focused, focused every three minutes
so, might've looked and, know, take look sky looked around
make sure people not there, et cetera. stands reason
will case. Again, neural circuits haven't evolved much. Now,
multitasking, shown interesting physiological signature,
multitask, jump back forth things, increase
level neurotransmitter, also sometimes called neuromodulator, basically
thing sake discussion. increase neurotransmitter
epinephrine, adrenaline. so, really nice studies now, pointing
fact bit multitasking prior, jumping focused, goal directed
behavior, whether not mental behavior physical behavior, can actually useful
gets us action. told multitasking terrible,
you, instance, find cleaning house also checking phone
number things, right point sitting write
focused work. probably reflects adaptive mechanism, use
action somewhat varied multitasking action order generate adrenaline
system, adrenaline just gets action. Now, great, but, don't


want multitask throughout kind goal seeking goal pursuit behavior. Because,
also clear going talk exquisite depth today,
visual focus particular contracting visual window, bringing aperture
see, fine point, can absolutely increase clarity goal seeking
likelihood will pursue goals. talked little bit
podcast way increasing focus kind pursuit. talked
practice, whereby can literally look dot line, placed wall
computer front 30 60 seconds, moving dedicated
work, need focus. indeed, just looking narrow piece visual
world, small piece visual world period time forcing
hold gaze location best can, can increase level cognitive
attention ability focus stay focused. not magic.
consequence fact, cognition follows visual perception.
low vision no vision, meaning blind, trouble
seeing, lab lot work people, low vision, no vision. tend
use auditory system, hearing, way anchor attention particular
things. people can see see pretty well visual focus way
that. Now, earlier, talking notion peripersonal space versus
extra personal space. just going seed little bit later conversation
saying, focus external point. process exteroception,
focus extra personal space, not peripersonal space. focus
something, say line wall 30 60 seconds computer 30 60
seconds just look move kind action, whether not work
action physical action. core. engaging pursuit extra
personal space. placing focus outside body therefore placing
brain goal pursuit mode. Work NYU, particular, laboratory
phenomenal researcher Psychology Department, name Emily Balcetis,
B-A-L-C-E-T-I-S. Emily Balcetis, done really nice work this. done is,
had, people focus visual attention goal line sort
engage sort behavior, requires lot effort. done lot
different experiments like this, just explain one. always include control
group, people go physical effort mental effort,
don't focus attention just one location. long short studies
that, people focus attention one location, like goal line,


much effective reaching goals achieve
perception, expended less effort. give example one particularly
nice study Balcetis Lab. particular study involves, physical exercise.
Although, mentioned before, done similar studies looking cognitive type
work. group people, exercise, wearing 15 pound ankle
weights, basically move certain distance run certain distance
reach goal line. One group focused goal line, visually focused, goal
line. group not told visually focus goal line. found,
group focused goal line, able achieve reaching goal
17% less effort. measured effort got 23% quicker.
remarkable difference. distance traveled, workload
everyone's wearing 15 pound weights ankles. One group simply
looking goal line, group not told look goal line, simply
looking goal line, something psychology end physiology
people, allows move forward less perceived effort
quickly. remarkable. case, focused goal line,
moments, talk one can use updating goal line, incremental goal

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk

worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher

one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly

weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones

interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family

behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness

time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking

wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many

talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely

failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

01:39:50 Tool 9: Space-Time Bridging



regulating dopamine system. want sure include tool,
especially powerful me, grounded neuroscience research
psychology research. describe tool next, think see ways
measures nicely work Emily Balcetis colleagues done.
something that, personally many years, based understanding
visual system understanding indeed can move cognition

accessible us. can shift mode mode exteroception
focusing things outside confines skin beyond reach,
literally goal directed behaviors goal directed thoughts. something
past, talked little bit talked something called,

before, not focusing particular location horizon. trying
dilate aperture field view, can see much visual landscape

said three, one 10. doesn't really matter. Or, also going
depend on, instance, slowly breathing. 'Cause breathing might

taught. start simple one. heard multitasking bad.
heard multitasking bad, doesn't allow focus. want achieve
anything, want accomplish anything, not multitask. Well, turns out,
wrong. turns role multitasking, multitasking
placed particular time within goal seeking behavior order effective.
Really nice studies done Carnegie Mellon University, Davis Lab, evaluated
long people able focus different environments. long able

collected seeds nuts berries three minutes probably stood
up, looked around kept going. hunting animals
sort pursuit, fishing, et cetera, focused, focused, focused every three minutes
so, might've looked and, know, take look sky looked around
make sure people not there, et cetera. stands reason
will case. Again, neural circuits haven't evolved much. Now,
multitasking, shown interesting physiological signature,
multitask, jump back forth things, increase
level neurotransmitter, also sometimes called neuromodulator, basically
thing sake discussion. increase neurotransmitter
epinephrine, adrenaline. so, really nice studies now, pointing
fact bit multitasking prior, jumping focused, goal directed

gets us action. told multitasking terrible,
you, instance, find cleaning house also checking phone

want multitask throughout kind goal seeking goal pursuit behavior. Because,

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk

course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas

place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close

deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher

one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly

based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones

happens focus particular location? Believe not, increase
particular feature blood pressure. Now body has, course, arteries, veins
capillaries, heart pumps blood, first arteries,
components vascular system. so-called, blood pressure. Blood
pressure just much, fluid volume pressing arteries, veins
capillaries. can imagine pipe little fluid moving it, low

stuff, moving forward, even pressure. blood pressure
probably blood pressure measured. always two numbers.
top number, systolic blood pressure. bottom number,

something like donut. Whereas kinds goals work, place
longer term can create heightened sense motivation, tend things
much rewarding us. delay discounting simply says that,
time given goal is, less effective reward will motivating one's

sorts long-term investment, Balcetis Lab, therefore experiment,
looked people's tendency save money later life. groups
created study, really interesting. one group, imagine,
like 30 40 years older. invest certain amount money,

important issue kicked around

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful

circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win

time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness

simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's

visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive

relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate

likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards

much effective reaching goals achieve
perception, expended less effort. give example one particularly
nice study Balcetis Lab. particular study involves, physical exercise.
Although, mentioned before, done similar studies looking cognitive type
work. group people, exercise, wearing 15 pound ankle
weights, basically move certain distance run certain distance
reach goal line. One group focused goal line, visually focused, goal
line. group not told visually focus goal line. found,
group focused goal line, able achieve reaching goal
17% less effort. measured effort got 23% quicker.
remarkable difference. distance traveled, workload
everyone's wearing 15 pound weights ankles. One group simply
looking goal line, group not told look goal line, simply
looking goal line, something psychology end physiology
people, allows move forward less perceived effort
quickly. remarkable. case, focused goal line,
moments, talk one can use updating goal line, incremental goal
line. Starting intermediate goal, extending goal line
further. just sit back second think that, just changing
person looks, changed perceived effort ability something,
effectively, quickly, group not deliberately focusing visual
attention one location. incredible. incredible, fact, might say,
well, possibly be? Well, turns out, specific, underlying

special focusing one's visual attention given location? Well, turns
two branches visual system. visual information comes

particular location study Balcetis Lab,
found was, focusing goal line allows people, move effectively toward
goal. something can leverage aspects goal pursuits.
happens focus particular location? Believe not, increase
particular feature blood pressure. Now body has, course, arteries, veins
capillaries, heart pumps blood, first arteries,
components vascular system. so-called, blood pressure. Blood
pressure just much, fluid volume pressing arteries, veins
capillaries. can imagine pipe little fluid moving it, low
pressure. pipe lot fluid moving it, even
pressure. pipe lot viscous, meaning, kind sticky, thick
stuff, moving forward, even pressure. blood pressure
probably blood pressure measured. always two numbers.
top number, systolic blood pressure. bottom number,
line, diastolic pressure. important thing understand,
blood pressure will rise heart beats, fluid


moving pipes arteries veins capillaries.
top number called systole systolic blood pressure,
pressure time, heart contracts. top number, normally,
healthy blood pressure, somewhere range 90 120 millimeters
mercury. Millimeters mercury just way, pressure measured. top
number, systole, systolic blood pressure, measured
heart contracts. So, amount pressure heartbeat
moving vasculature. Now, beats, heartbeats,
relaxes, blood pressure going drop lower value fluid isn't
pumped system moments. bottom, diastolic
pressure. typically healthy people, going 60 80 millimeters
mercury. might hear normal blood pressure about, again,
approximate, 120 80. means is, point blood
pumped there, arteries veins, boom, 120 millimeters
mercury, then, heart relaxes second next beat,
drops 80. high pressure, low pressure, high pressure, low pressure.
fluid pumped system. Now, telling this? Well,
turns out, neural circuits link visual system focusing
particular point top number, systolic blood pressure. focus
eyes particular location, systolic blood pressure goes up,

releasing adrenaline, low amounts adrenaline cases. adrenaline,
readies body action. So, bringing visual focus particular location,

pursuit. like read scientific studies read review


scientific studies, looked how, narrowing one's visual attention, can really
enhance effectiveness pursuing goals, put link study. title
study is, keeping goal sight, testing influence narrowed visual attention
physical activity. paper Emily Balcetis's Lab, focuses mainly
physical activities, mentioned things well. article
published Personality Social Psychology Bulletin 2020, recent.
exceptional paper opinion, really gets heart works
examples implemented. apply visual tool,
simple way, type goal want pursue. already know goal
want pursue, maybe workout, maybe cognitive work particular
sort. Again, process simple. going focus visual attention one
point beyond peripersonal space, computer.
wall, horizon. distance going focus
visual attention there. effort going hold visual attention
30 60 seconds, might blink, okay, going try hold
visual attention there. no moving head around. No diverting attention
locations. people will find easy do. people will find quite
hard. mind may drift cognitively, okay, try bring visual attention
common point. Several episodes ago, talked how, actually
studies looking developing kind training students, ADHD data
actually quite encouraging. people ADHD focus issues
attentional issues, can effective. people don't, can also effective.
Again, places brain body state readiness idea
move particular actions, bring closer goal. haven't yet talked
set goals assess progress. simply pursue goals.
visual component important, fact, argue visual system
harnessing visual attention narrow point, going effective way,
get brain body mode action, pursue whatever goal
trying pursue. practice stark contrast multitasking, definition
attention moving place place place. mentioned multitasking can
effective getting system somewhat increased level activation,
can pursue focused goal. visual attention particular point,
going effective way bring system



00:54:40 Tool 3: Use Aged Self-Images Self-Motivate

state readiness action goal pursuit. another really interesting
way, can leverage visual system toward long-term goals. Balcetis Lab
also done, really interesting experiments, looking people's ability set
stick long-term goals. long-term goal looked at, one related
saving money later life. something lot people struggle with, lot
people hard time investing money saving money later life. Simply
human beings, vary extent worry going
happen later. also phenomenon so-called, delay discounting. Delay
discounting, fact goals, become less rewarding exist
future. may experienced walking past donut shop. love donuts
just going admit it, spot. love smell them. love
taste them. try eat 'cause told not good indeed,
don't think are. occasionally cave eat one many. general, try not
cave immediately rewarding properties smell taste donut.
But, know smell donut smell wonderful piece food,
immediate term, brings level focus, mental focus immediate
phase. feels rewarding, like now, just good.
actually extend reward tomorrow next thing think, today
happens Saturday, recording, but, Tuesday morning, going
get donut. doesn't value reward system, doesn't work
well long-term goals. not salient. not tangible, goal, especially
something like donut. Whereas kinds goals work, place
longer term can create heightened sense motivation, tend things
much rewarding us. delay discounting simply says that,
time given goal is, less effective reward will motivating one's
behavior. indeed see saving money retirement, see
sorts long-term investment, Balcetis Lab, therefore experiment,
looked people's tendency save money later life. groups
created study, really interesting. one group, imagine,
like 30 40 years older. invest certain amount money,
according whatever thought need. measured
amount set aside saved later life. group, actually


viewed photos themselves, picture, images artificially,
digitally aged, see 30 40 years future.
turns people second group, simply perceiving image,
future, invested far money later life. set aside money. Somehow
bridged gap immediate experience life longer arc toward
going like 30 40 years. powerful result opinion,
says again, visual perception future visual
perception present, allows us anchor goal directed systems
motivation take things immediate term might not seem useful. So,
can imagine sorts variations this. can imagine every time want
donut, see vision actual physical picture consequence
eaten many donuts every day next 10 years. don't know
image look like 'cause never seen it. not experiment
necessarily need not motivated eat donuts,
confess, somebody think pretty good managing resources. think
see image 70 75, many things associated
visual images. Like body must feel like, needs probably going
like state age. sorts things may may not still able
age. anchors back immediate goal-directed behaviors,
setting aside money retirement. investing one's health practices.
indeed study looked people will invest exercise healthy
eating. just think future might like future versus
seeing images future, go healthy
unhealthy route. again, point visual system, see, principally
important defining immediate term. Even see relates
something far off distance. think phenomenal studies get right
important issue kicked around

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining

brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

01:39:50 Tool 9: Space-Time Bridging



regulating dopamine system. want sure include tool,
especially powerful me, grounded neuroscience research
psychology research. describe tool next, think see ways
measures nicely work Emily Balcetis colleagues done.
something that, personally many years, based understanding
visual system understanding indeed can move cognition
perception place interoception focusing peripersonal space.
space within us immediately around us things immediately
accessible us. can shift mode mode exteroception
focusing things outside confines skin beyond reach,
literally goal directed behaviors goal directed thoughts. something
past, talked little bit talked something called,
space-time bridging. haven't talked much time domain visual

way, stepping one's focus extra personal space back

eyes, done sitting standing. close eyes
focus much attention, including visual attention inner

maybe even surface skin, really focusing internally. Now, can
focus visual attention internally, eyes closed? Well,
imagining inner landscape. don't imagine heart beating

three breaths again, focusing internal state, now splitting
little bit attention interoception exteroception. focusing something
outside me, ratio split attention 90, 10, 90% attention
focused internally, also focusing attention externally. people
can pretty easily. Then, third, call, station. now move visual

move 90% attention external object. now really biasing
perception attention towards exteroception. breathe, paying attention
three breaths, still 10%, focused internal

much attention, outside myself, maintaining just little bit internal state,
can measure cadence three breaths. move visual attention
yet another station, away, typically, horizon something far off
distance, can possibly see. duration three breaths.
point, trying best move 99, not 100% attention external

cognition much broader sphere. that, magnocellular vision talked
before, not focusing particular location horizon. trying
dilate aperture field view, can see much visual landscape
possible. internal, excuse me, indoors, might

happens focus particular location? Believe not, increase
particular feature blood pressure. Now body has, course, arteries, veins
capillaries, heart pumps blood, first arteries,
components vascular system. so-called, blood pressure. Blood
pressure just much, fluid volume pressing arteries, veins
capillaries. can imagine pipe little fluid moving it, low
pressure. pipe lot fluid moving it, even
pressure. pipe lot viscous, meaning, kind sticky, thick
stuff, moving forward, even pressure. blood pressure
probably blood pressure measured. always two numbers.
top number, systolic blood pressure. bottom number,

blood pressure will rise heart beats, fluid


moving pipes arteries veins capillaries.
top number called systole systolic blood pressure,
pressure time, heart contracts. top number, normally,
healthy blood pressure, somewhere range 90 120 millimeters

00:51:55 Tool 2: Use Focal Vision Initiate Goal Pursuit

want pursue best route pursue achieve goal. Focusing
visual attention one particular point, incredibly effective types goal
pursuit. like read scientific studies read review


scientific studies, looked how, narrowing one's visual attention, can really
enhance effectiveness pursuing goals, put link study. title
study is, keeping goal sight, testing influence narrowed visual attention

common point. Several episodes ago, talked how, actually
studies looking developing kind training students, ADHD data
actually quite encouraging. people ADHD focus issues
attentional issues, can effective. people don't, can also effective.
Again, places brain body state readiness idea
move particular actions, bring closer goal. haven't yet talked
set goals assess progress. simply pursue goals.
visual component important, fact, argue visual system

can pursue focused goal. visual attention particular point,
going effective way bring system



00:54:40 Tool 3: Use Aged Self-Images Self-Motivate

state readiness action goal pursuit. another really interesting
way, can leverage visual system toward long-term goals. Balcetis Lab
also done, really interesting experiments, looking people's ability set
stick long-term goals. long-term goal looked at, one related

people hard time investing money saving money later life. Simply
human beings, vary extent worry going

discounting, fact goals, become less rewarding exist

But, know smell donut smell wonderful piece food,
immediate term, brings level focus, mental focus immediate

actually extend reward tomorrow next thing think, today
happens Saturday, recording, but, Tuesday morning, going
get donut. doesn't value reward system, doesn't work
well long-term goals. not salient. not tangible, goal, especially
something like donut. Whereas kinds goals work, place
longer term can create heightened sense motivation, tend things
much rewarding us. delay discounting simply says that,
time given goal is, less effective reward will motivating one's
behavior. indeed see saving money retirement, see
sorts long-term investment, Balcetis Lab, therefore experiment,
looked people's tendency save money later life. groups
created study, really interesting. one group, imagine,
like 30 40 years older. invest certain amount money,
according whatever thought need. measured
amount set aside saved later life. group, actually


viewed photos themselves, picture, images artificially,
digitally aged, see 30 40 years future.
turns people second group, simply perceiving image,
future, invested far money later life. set aside money. Somehow
bridged gap immediate experience life longer arc toward
going like 30 40 years. powerful result opinion,
says again, visual perception future visual
perception present, allows us anchor goal directed systems
motivation take things immediate term might not seem useful. So,
can imagine sorts variations this. can imagine every time want

setting aside money retirement. investing one's health practices.
indeed study looked people will invest exercise healthy
eating. just think future might like future versus
seeing images future, go healthy
unhealthy route. again, point visual system, see, principally
important defining immediate term. Even see relates
something far off distance. think phenomenal studies get right
important issue kicked around

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

01:39:50 Tool 9: Space-Time Bridging



regulating dopamine system. want sure include tool,
especially powerful me, grounded neuroscience research
psychology research. describe tool next, think see ways
measures nicely work Emily Balcetis colleagues done.
something that, personally many years, based understanding
visual system understanding indeed can move cognition

then, course updating goals, need update goals.
enormously confusing batch challenges, think once,
break elements, visual system can help find

remarkable feature physiology gets right point
psychological phenomenon talking earlier. just recall
are. won't list all, but, goal significant, say.
psychologists, popular stuff online says, significant,

now described psychology underlying physiology. Now,
like mesh within context actual specific goal setting goal pursuit.
many probably thinking is, well, physiology,
psychology, actually apply towards setting achieving
goals? Well, that, understanding mental frame attention
always either positioned, peripersonal space, focused immediate

dynamically travel back forth those. next, going talk
about, literature says things like visualization, immediate

00:51:55 Tool 2: Use Focal Vision Initiate Goal Pursuit

want pursue best route pursue achieve goal. Focusing
visual attention one particular point, incredibly effective types goal
pursuit. like read scientific studies read review


scientific studies, looked how, narrowing one's visual attention, can really
enhance effectiveness pursuing goals, put link study. title
study is, keeping goal sight, testing influence narrowed visual attention
physical activity. paper Emily Balcetis's Lab, focuses mainly
physical activities, mentioned things well. article
published Personality Social Psychology Bulletin 2020, recent.
exceptional paper opinion, really gets heart works
examples implemented. apply visual tool,
simple way, type goal want pursue. already know goal
want pursue, maybe workout, maybe cognitive work particular
sort. Again, process simple. going focus visual attention one
point beyond peripersonal space, computer.
wall, horizon. distance going focus
visual attention there. effort going hold visual attention
30 60 seconds, might blink, okay, going try hold
visual attention there. no moving head around. No diverting attention
locations. people will find easy do. people will find quite
hard. mind may drift cognitively, okay, try bring visual attention
common point. Several episodes ago, talked how, actually
studies looking developing kind training students, ADHD data
actually quite encouraging. people ADHD focus issues
attentional issues, can effective. people don't, can also effective.
Again, places brain body state readiness idea
move particular actions, bring closer goal. haven't yet talked
set goals assess progress. simply pursue goals.
visual component important, fact, argue visual system
harnessing visual attention narrow point, going effective way,
get brain body mode action, pursue whatever goal
trying pursue. practice stark contrast multitasking, definition
attention moving place place place. mentioned multitasking can
effective getting system somewhat increased level activation,
can pursue focused goal. visual attention particular point,
going effective way bring system



00:54:40 Tool 3: Use Aged Self-Images Self-Motivate

state readiness action goal pursuit. another really interesting
way, can leverage visual system toward long-term goals. Balcetis Lab
also done, really interesting experiments, looking people's ability set
stick long-term goals. long-term goal looked at, one related
saving money later life. something lot people struggle with, lot
people hard time investing money saving money later life. Simply
human beings, vary extent worry going
happen later. also phenomenon so-called, delay discounting. Delay
discounting, fact goals, become less rewarding exist
future. may experienced walking past donut shop. love donuts
just going admit it, spot. love smell them. love
taste them. try eat 'cause told not good indeed,
don't think are. occasionally cave eat one many. general, try not
cave immediately rewarding properties smell taste donut.
But, know smell donut smell wonderful piece food,
immediate term, brings level focus, mental focus immediate
phase. feels rewarding, like now, just good.
actually extend reward tomorrow next thing think, today
happens Saturday, recording, but, Tuesday morning, going
get donut. doesn't value reward system, doesn't work
well long-term goals. not salient. not tangible, goal, especially
something like donut. Whereas kinds goals work, place
longer term can create heightened sense motivation, tend things
much rewarding us. delay discounting simply says that,
time given goal is, less effective reward will motivating one's
behavior. indeed see saving money retirement, see
sorts long-term investment, Balcetis Lab, therefore experiment,
looked people's tendency save money later life. groups
created study, really interesting. one group, imagine,
like 30 40 years older. invest certain amount money,
according whatever thought need. measured
amount set aside saved later life. group, actually


viewed photos themselves, picture, images artificially,
digitally aged, see 30 40 years future.
turns people second group, simply perceiving image,
future, invested far money later life. set aside money. Somehow
bridged gap immediate experience life longer arc toward
going like 30 40 years. powerful result opinion,
says again, visual perception future visual
perception present, allows us anchor goal directed systems
motivation take things immediate term might not seem useful. So,
can imagine sorts variations this. can imagine every time want
donut, see vision actual physical picture consequence
eaten many donuts every day next 10 years. don't know
image look like 'cause never seen it. not experiment
necessarily need not motivated eat donuts,
confess, somebody think pretty good managing resources. think
see image 70 75, many things associated
visual images. Like body must feel like, needs probably going
like state age. sorts things may may not still able
age. anchors back immediate goal-directed behaviors,
setting aside money retirement. investing one's health practices.
indeed study looked people will invest exercise healthy
eating. just think future might like future versus
seeing images future, go healthy
unhealthy route. again, point visual system, see, principally
important defining immediate term. Even see relates
something far off distance. think phenomenal studies get right
important issue kicked around

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals

update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk

room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

01:39:50 Tool 9: Space-Time Bridging



regulating dopamine system. want sure include tool,
especially powerful me, grounded neuroscience research

then, course updating goals, need update goals.
enormously confusing batch challenges, think once,

00:51:55 Tool 2: Use Focal Vision Initiate Goal Pursuit

want pursue best route pursue achieve goal. Focusing
visual attention one particular point, incredibly effective types goal
pursuit. like read scientific studies read review


scientific studies, looked how, narrowing one's visual attention, can really
enhance effectiveness pursuing goals, put link study. title
study is, keeping goal sight, testing influence narrowed visual attention
physical activity. paper Emily Balcetis's Lab, focuses mainly
physical activities, mentioned things well. article
published Personality Social Psychology Bulletin 2020, recent.
exceptional paper opinion, really gets heart works
examples implemented. apply visual tool,
simple way, type goal want pursue. already know goal
want pursue, maybe workout, maybe cognitive work particular
sort. Again, process simple. going focus visual attention one
point beyond peripersonal space, computer.
wall, horizon. distance going focus
visual attention there. effort going hold visual attention
30 60 seconds, might blink, okay, going try hold
visual attention there. no moving head around. No diverting attention
locations. people will find easy do. people will find quite
hard. mind may drift cognitively, okay, try bring visual attention
common point. Several episodes ago, talked how, actually
studies looking developing kind training students, ADHD data
actually quite encouraging. people ADHD focus issues
attentional issues, can effective. people don't, can also effective.
Again, places brain body state readiness idea
move particular actions, bring closer goal. haven't yet talked
set goals assess progress. simply pursue goals.
visual component important, fact, argue visual system
harnessing visual attention narrow point, going effective way,
get brain body mode action, pursue whatever goal
trying pursue. practice stark contrast multitasking, definition
attention moving place place place. mentioned multitasking can
effective getting system somewhat increased level activation,
can pursue focused goal. visual attention particular point,
going effective way bring system



00:54:40 Tool 3: Use Aged Self-Images Self-Motivate

state readiness action goal pursuit. another really interesting
way, can leverage visual system toward long-term goals. Balcetis Lab
also done, really interesting experiments, looking people's ability set
stick long-term goals. long-term goal looked at, one related
saving money later life. something lot people struggle with, lot
people hard time investing money saving money later life. Simply
human beings, vary extent worry going
happen later. also phenomenon so-called, delay discounting. Delay
discounting, fact goals, become less rewarding exist
future. may experienced walking past donut shop. love donuts
just going admit it, spot. love smell them. love
taste them. try eat 'cause told not good indeed,
don't think are. occasionally cave eat one many. general, try not
cave immediately rewarding properties smell taste donut.
But, know smell donut smell wonderful piece food,
immediate term, brings level focus, mental focus immediate
phase. feels rewarding, like now, just good.
actually extend reward tomorrow next thing think, today
happens Saturday, recording, but, Tuesday morning, going
get donut. doesn't value reward system, doesn't work
well long-term goals. not salient. not tangible, goal, especially
something like donut. Whereas kinds goals work, place
longer term can create heightened sense motivation, tend things
much rewarding us. delay discounting simply says that,
time given goal is, less effective reward will motivating one's
behavior. indeed see saving money retirement, see
sorts long-term investment, Balcetis Lab, therefore experiment,
looked people's tendency save money later life. groups
created study, really interesting. one group, imagine,
like 30 40 years older. invest certain amount money,
according whatever thought need. measured
amount set aside saved later life. group, actually


viewed photos themselves, picture, images artificially,
digitally aged, see 30 40 years future.
turns people second group, simply perceiving image,
future, invested far money later life. set aside money. Somehow
bridged gap immediate experience life longer arc toward
going like 30 40 years. powerful result opinion,
says again, visual perception future visual
perception present, allows us anchor goal directed systems
motivation take things immediate term might not seem useful. So,
can imagine sorts variations this. can imagine every time want
donut, see vision actual physical picture consequence
eaten many donuts every day next 10 years. don't know
image look like 'cause never seen it. not experiment
necessarily need not motivated eat donuts,
confess, somebody think pretty good managing resources. think
see image 70 75, many things associated
visual images. Like body must feel like, needs probably going
like state age. sorts things may may not still able
age. anchors back immediate goal-directed behaviors,
setting aside money retirement. investing one's health practices.
indeed study looked people will invest exercise healthy
eating. just think future might like future versus
seeing images future, go healthy
unhealthy route. again, point visual system, see, principally
important defining immediate term. Even see relates
something far off distance. think phenomenal studies get right
important issue kicked around

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

scientific studies, looked how, narrowing one's visual attention, can really
enhance effectiveness pursuing goals, put link study. title
study is, keeping goal sight, testing influence narrowed visual attention
physical activity. paper Emily Balcetis's Lab, focuses mainly
physical activities, mentioned things well. article
published Personality Social Psychology Bulletin 2020, recent.
exceptional paper opinion, really gets heart works
examples implemented. apply visual tool,
simple way, type goal want pursue. already know goal
want pursue, maybe workout, maybe cognitive work particular
sort. Again, process simple. going focus visual attention one
point beyond peripersonal space, computer.
wall, horizon. distance going focus
visual attention there. effort going hold visual attention
30 60 seconds, might blink, okay, going try hold
visual attention there. no moving head around. No diverting attention
locations. people will find easy do. people will find quite
hard. mind may drift cognitively, okay, try bring visual attention
common point. Several episodes ago, talked how, actually
studies looking developing kind training students, ADHD data
actually quite encouraging. people ADHD focus issues
attentional issues, can effective. people don't, can also effective.
Again, places brain body state readiness idea
move particular actions, bring closer goal. haven't yet talked
set goals assess progress. simply pursue goals.
visual component important, fact, argue visual system
harnessing visual attention narrow point, going effective way,
get brain body mode action, pursue whatever goal
trying pursue. practice stark contrast multitasking, definition
attention moving place place place. mentioned multitasking can
effective getting system somewhat increased level activation,
can pursue focused goal. visual attention particular point,
going effective way bring system



00:54:40 Tool 3: Use Aged Self-Images Self-Motivate

state readiness action goal pursuit. another really interesting
way, can leverage visual system toward long-term goals. Balcetis Lab
also done, really interesting experiments, looking people's ability set
stick long-term goals. long-term goal looked at, one related
saving money later life. something lot people struggle with, lot
people hard time investing money saving money later life. Simply
human beings, vary extent worry going
happen later. also phenomenon so-called, delay discounting. Delay
discounting, fact goals, become less rewarding exist
future. may experienced walking past donut shop. love donuts
just going admit it, spot. love smell them. love
taste them. try eat 'cause told not good indeed,
don't think are. occasionally cave eat one many. general, try not
cave immediately rewarding properties smell taste donut.
But, know smell donut smell wonderful piece food,
immediate term, brings level focus, mental focus immediate
phase. feels rewarding, like now, just good.
actually extend reward tomorrow next thing think, today
happens Saturday, recording, but, Tuesday morning, going
get donut. doesn't value reward system, doesn't work
well long-term goals. not salient. not tangible, goal, especially
something like donut. Whereas kinds goals work, place
longer term can create heightened sense motivation, tend things
much rewarding us. delay discounting simply says that,
time given goal is, less effective reward will motivating one's
behavior. indeed see saving money retirement, see
sorts long-term investment, Balcetis Lab, therefore experiment,
looked people's tendency save money later life. groups
created study, really interesting. one group, imagine,
like 30 40 years older. invest certain amount money,
according whatever thought need. measured
amount set aside saved later life. group, actually


viewed photos themselves, picture, images artificially,
digitally aged, see 30 40 years future.
turns people second group, simply perceiving image,
future, invested far money later life. set aside money. Somehow
bridged gap immediate experience life longer arc toward
going like 30 40 years. powerful result opinion,
says again, visual perception future visual
perception present, allows us anchor goal directed systems
motivation take things immediate term might not seem useful. So,
can imagine sorts variations this. can imagine every time want
donut, see vision actual physical picture consequence
eaten many donuts every day next 10 years. don't know
image look like 'cause never seen it. not experiment
necessarily need not motivated eat donuts,
confess, somebody think pretty good managing resources. think
see image 70 75, many things associated
visual images. Like body must feel like, needs probably going
like state age. sorts things may may not still able
age. anchors back immediate goal-directed behaviors,
setting aside money retirement. investing one's health practices.
indeed study looked people will invest exercise healthy
eating. just think future might like future versus
seeing images future, go healthy
unhealthy route. again, point visual system, see, principally
important defining immediate term. Even see relates
something far off distance. think phenomenal studies get right
important issue kicked around

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

01:39:50 Tool 9: Space-Time Bridging



regulating dopamine system. want sure include tool,
especially powerful me, grounded neuroscience research
psychology research. describe tool next, think see ways
measures nicely work Emily Balcetis colleagues done.
something that, personally many years, based understanding
visual system understanding indeed can move cognition
perception place interoception focusing peripersonal space.
space within us immediately around us things immediately
accessible us. can shift mode mode exteroception
focusing things outside confines skin beyond reach,
literally goal directed behaviors goal directed thoughts. something
past, talked little bit talked something called,
space-time bridging. haven't talked much time domain visual
system today. space-time bridging, simply way using one's visual system
focus peripersonal space interoception. gradually deliberate
way, stepping one's focus extra personal space back
peripersonal space way gives lot flexibility control ability

underlying science underlying mechanism.

eyes, done sitting standing. close eyes
focus much attention, including visual attention inner

focus visual attention internally, eyes closed? Well,
imagining inner landscape. don't imagine heart beating

way, can leverage visual system toward long-term goals. Balcetis Lab
also done, really interesting experiments, looking people's ability set
stick long-term goals. long-term goal looked at, one related
saving money later life. something lot people struggle with, lot
people hard time investing money saving money later life. Simply
human beings, vary extent worry going
happen later. also phenomenon so-called, delay discounting. Delay
discounting, fact goals, become less rewarding exist
future. may experienced walking past donut shop. love donuts
just going admit it, spot. love smell them. love
taste them. try eat 'cause told not good indeed,
don't think are. occasionally cave eat one many. general, try not
cave immediately rewarding properties smell taste donut.
But, know smell donut smell wonderful piece food,
immediate term, brings level focus, mental focus immediate
phase. feels rewarding, like now, just good.
actually extend reward tomorrow next thing think, today
happens Saturday, recording, but, Tuesday morning, going
get donut. doesn't value reward system, doesn't work
well long-term goals. not salient. not tangible, goal, especially
something like donut. Whereas kinds goals work, place
longer term can create heightened sense motivation, tend things
much rewarding us. delay discounting simply says that,
time given goal is, less effective reward will motivating one's
behavior. indeed see saving money retirement, see
sorts long-term investment, Balcetis Lab, therefore experiment,
looked people's tendency save money later life. groups
created study, really interesting. one group, imagine,
like 30 40 years older. invest certain amount money,
according whatever thought need. measured
amount set aside saved later life. group, actually


viewed photos themselves, picture, images artificially,
digitally aged, see 30 40 years future.
turns people second group, simply perceiving image,
future, invested far money later life. set aside money. Somehow
bridged gap immediate experience life longer arc toward
going like 30 40 years. powerful result opinion,
says again, visual perception future visual
perception present, allows us anchor goal directed systems

can imagine sorts variations this. can imagine every time want

necessarily need not motivated eat donuts,
confess, somebody think pretty good managing resources. think

setting aside money retirement. investing one's health practices.
indeed study looked people will invest exercise healthy
eating. just think future might like future versus
seeing images future, go healthy
unhealthy route. again, point visual system, see, principally
important defining immediate term. Even see relates
something far off distance. think phenomenal studies get right
important issue kicked around

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal

00:59:33 Tool 4: Visualization Goals Helpful Start

literature discussion goal seeking,
visualization. keep big goal mind, focus big goal. now
going address, science say visualizing big goals?
somebody interested business, say focused relationship,


thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

thinking perfect relationship look like family
live. effective generating kinds
behaviors will lead that? effective think big win end?
Well, turns is, very, careful
implement visualization. 'Cause correctly, can really serve goal
seeking well. incorrectly, can undermine entire process. So,
visualization work? Well, turns out, visualization big win, end goal.
Superbowl win eight gold medals Olympics graduation university
choice making certain amount money finding partner choice,
et cetera. visualization effective getting goal pursuit process started,
actually pretty lousy maybe even counterproductive way maintaining pursuit
goal. Meaning continuing engage sort actions going get
eventually achieve goal. think going surprising people, first,
think back discussion physiology blood pressure system, it'll
make sense. Good scientific studies done people told imagine,
even script long-term vision goal themselves. big goal?
talked to, told imagine rich amount detail. think
going feel body big win. basically happens is,
measure people's blood pressure metrics physiology, see increase
systolic blood pressure. kind ramping readiness
excitement goal, increase blood pressure quickly wanes.
time, visual long-term goal, becomes poor thing rely order
generate actions required reach goal. fact, much better
way maintain ongoing action toward goal also involves visualization,

01:02:05 Tool 5: Visualizing Failure Best Ongoing Motivator

turns not visualizing success. visualizing failure.
Balcetis Lab labs looked whether not people make progress toward
goals different types. Whether not thinking goal. thinking
goal line want achieve, long-term goal
wonderful things associated it, whether not thinking ways
fail, en route goal. not typically
encouraged do. Typically, told don't imagine failure, push failure


mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue

epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

mind, focus success. Fake till make it, phrase absolutely hate,
frankly, not even clear means. not even clear
ethical form is. think means continue despite anxiety fear things
won't work out. look literature, scientific literature, Balcetis
Lab labs shown, near doubling, near doubling
probability reaching one's goal, focus routinely foreshadowing failure.
think ways things fail, take action take action B
instead, therefore, take action C. supposed think things
fail, don't get run morning, goal is, say fitness goal.
use example, even though realized, people pursuit
many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals physical goals concrete thing
can get page 'cause related actions. say,
somebody sets goal running five miles, four times week, minimum, many
seven, four times week, minimum 8:00 AM. previous podcast habits,
talked benefits not necessarily setting specific times one will things,
setting time blocks one things. say 8:00 AM, going
run five miles going happen seven days week. One version
be, okay, sit back chair think great going feel
look, every day. health going improve.
everything's going be, blood markers, lipids, et cetera, going improve,
okay, fine. visualization goal visualizing end point. turns far
less effective maybe even counterproductive, compared thinking
going happen, don't this. negative health outcomes going
occur, disappointment going yourself. fact going
wait 7.30, not long enough many people run five miles. got put
shoes pouring rain even hailing snowing, outside.
now not going outside unless somebody particularly motivated
that. So, foreshadowing failure turns best way motivate toward goal
pursuit. fact, mentioned before, near doubling likelihood
people will reach goals kind. constantly thinking bad
going be, fail. think back neural circuit associated assessing
value goal pursuits, makes perfect sense. amygdala, center
brain involved anxiety fear worry. Well, amygdala, one four
core components goal setting goal pursuit circuitry. no bypassing


that. no one listening watching amygdala not involved
goal setting goal pursuit behavior. so, love able tell
think rainbows puppies wonderful, rewarding
things going happen achieve goals. truth is,
thinking mainly bad really going get, don't it.
disappointed yourself, going feel. will negatively impact you, not
immediate term, long-term, indeed goal reach goal. So, want
emphasize not interested encouraging people flagellate themselves.
encouraging people achieve goals. turns best way that,
foreshadowing failure. specific can get writing thinking
talking about, bad will don't achieve goals, likely
achieve goals. Part reason almost certainly
increases systolic blood pressure increases readiness system,
imagine failure. brain body much better moving away fearful
things towards things want. wish tell wasn't case,
true asymmetry way built. fact, brain body can engage
called, one trial learning. something bad happens, eat food
makes us sick. interaction person place really don't like.
takes one trial really... One event, one time reorient rewire neural
circuitry, bias toward moving away thing future.
things go well, unfortunately, doesn't often occur. things go really, really well,
might orient brain body toward wanting thing. neural
circuitry changes will lead us engage particular behavior interaction
again, never effective avoidance circuits. again, foreshadow
failure, going visualize positive way, beginning
goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every while, imagine big win
scoring perfect exam winning championship great relationship.
time, want effective, focusing avoiding failure
really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow

seems effective. maps well known neural

harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic

really clear

01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty

failures look like feel like. Now, talk goal setting.
Going back prominent literature, psychology popular literature, again,


can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual

little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

three breaths again, focusing internal state, now splitting
little bit attention interoception exteroception. focusing something
outside me, ratio split attention 90, 10, 90% attention
focused internally, also focusing attention externally. people
can pretty easily. Then, third, call, station. now move visual

can hear themes start emerge. goal significant,
told. inspirational. aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay,
fine good, get semi quantitative this. least get biological
this. inspirational need be? need kind thing
inspiring can't sleep all? Well, wouldn't good believe
know, many heard say many, many times before, regular deep
sleep, 80% nights go sleep, going crucial
cognitive mental functioning ability achieve goals long-term.
absolutely clear. So, got be, inspirational exciting,
really look like correspond actually make
happen? Well, again, mismatch real data show
often told. Turns out, again, work Balcetis Lab, also
laboratories, addressed whether not probability achieving goal, goes
down, depending whether not one visualizes sets goal easy,
moderate impossible. impossible goal be, instance, say, going
jump front driveway, way road, road's, quite distance
away, 20 meters away. just not going happen. not going
happen lifetime, not going happen lifetime. Not unless
involves elaborate technology not aware of, jet pack something like
that. just not going happen. easy goal something like, can jump?
jump, two feet front me, obviously, yes. Now using trivial example
here, translated kind goal, school goal, physical goal, et
cetera. turns that, people set goals, whether not nutritional goals,
eat eat less that. Whether not fitness goals, run more, lift
more. goals, swim less, swim more, whatever goal happens be.
learning goal, relationship goal, attempt modify behavior.
turns goal easy, within reach, doesn't recruit enough
autonomic nervous system make pursuit goal, likely. Now might
surprising, least surprising me, think, well, something really, really
easy. low bar achieve it. People probably likely it.
turns not case, hear goal needs inspirational,
mean? hear something's easy, recruit action,
mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, found that,
goals easy people attain, didn't get increase systolic blood


pressure recruitment neural vascular systems, meaning blood
systems nervous system place ongoing effort.
quickly gave up. Also, goal lofty, far current abilities,
didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even people get excited
something mentally, simply didn't place body state readiness
wasn't tangible actually perhaps really achieve it. turns
goals moderate, just outside one's immediate abilities
one felt yeah, take lot effort. within range maybe
range, like maybe can it, maybe can't. near doubling
systolic blood pressure good sense. didn't go unhealthy range
doubling likelihood engage ongoing pursuit
particular goal. talking goal setting., saying is, set goals
realistic, aren't realistic, easy. goals need
realistic truly challenging. Don't set goals challenging lofty
crash blood pressure system direction make anyone
feel unmotivated. hearing this, makes sense, don't think predicted
it, not done controlled study. thought, loftier goal,
bigger goal, recruits autonomic system
people likely, lean energy effort pursue attain goal. also
thought goal really easy achieve, engage
systems action brain body enough people sort get motion
pursue goal. neither case. Again, set goals difficult
achieve, not lofty, collapse system feel
overwhelmed. important thing here, perceive goal, whether
not think within reach not, course will vary, depending whether not
rested. Depending whether not aspects life going well. mean,
can think hot heels lifetime goal everything's going well,
there'll crisis interpersonal crisis, there'll health crisis
shut down. goal seems very, hard attain. will talk
update goals different context minutes. But, course going
averaging, isn't something just once. takeaway
simple, set goals moderately hard hard, not hard easy

01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus 1-2 Major Goals Per Year



don't engage brain body properly. Moderate goals best,
want achieve goals. Now like talk three particular areas scientific
study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets
discovered that, greater, number things visual attention,
can draw attention goals off line pursuit. mean?
Well, think practical context. actually done. Big
department stores figured stock shelves, chock-a-block
many, many options food clothing items objects anything like that, people
simply buy stuff. People prone orienting attention whatever's
front them. put lot stuff front them, attention drifts, put fewer
things front them, attention narrow. later episode, talk
designing workspace, optimized basis this. doesn't mean
room nothing except just desk computer. Doesn't sparse,
visual sparseness, actually can help us orient focus behavior.
lot things visual environment, lot things cognitive
environment. thing. going try pursue fitness goal,
relationship goal, academic goal, longterm life financial goal once,
four things. going come systems allow isolate
goals rigid way. multiple interleaving goals


overlapping goals simultaneous goals, minutes, going talk
process will allow use visual system,

01:15:57 Tool 8: Ensure Specificity Goals, Weekly Assessment

align towards goals, sequentially, way makes much
likely achieve them. now talk specificity goals. heard
specific goal is, specific
going execute goal, higher probability will actually achieve
goal. indeed case, additional feature, not often
discussed. vitally important. fact, maybe important
specific time day specific end point mind. really nice study,
done looking recycling. something number groups, businesses,
households, individuals trying of. trying lower carbon
footprint contribute world general way throwing away fewer things
potentially recycled. studied context work
environment, business decides lets everybody know, going
greater effort toward recycling cans bottles bottles cans, et cetera.
then, way studies done, janitorial staff swapped
temporarily researchers actually measured number recyclable items
showed trash not recycle, function total amount trash.
Why'd say, function total amount trash? way controlling
differences beverage consumption one week next? Anyway, point
able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas
concrete plan everyone knew concrete plan was, instance,
place bottles cans recycle, not trash limit amount trash
50%, eliminate recyclable items trash. made
concrete, exactly action steps were, remarkable, mean, close
hundred fold improvement recycling behavior lasted many months
call action made. takeaway quite straightforward. means
concrete plan essential. can't just say, going become better


recycler going things better environment going
become physically fit. specific set action steps get right
details success look like. heard described
right look like? actual outcome one like achieve terms
action steps? not necessarily feeling states, wasn't sat around
said, great going feel world accomplish
goal? concrete statements, concrete plans action steps
deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher
probability meeting action steps. may asking, often
one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.
based performance update action plan upcoming week.
weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

01:39:50 Tool 9: Space-Time Bridging



regulating dopamine system. want sure include tool,
especially powerful me, grounded neuroscience research
psychology research. describe tool next, think see ways
measures nicely work Emily Balcetis colleagues done.
something that, personally many years, based understanding
visual system understanding indeed can move cognition
perception place interoception focusing peripersonal space.
space within us immediately around us things immediately
accessible us. can shift mode mode exteroception
focusing things outside confines skin beyond reach,
literally goal directed behaviors goal directed thoughts. something
past, talked little bit talked something called,
space-time bridging. haven't talked much time domain visual
system today. space-time bridging, simply way using one's visual system
focus peripersonal space interoception. gradually deliberate
way, stepping one's focus extra personal space back
peripersonal space way gives lot flexibility control ability
daily life. So, going first describe tool, will explain
underlying science underlying mechanism.
this. indoors outdoors, although, ideally,
location view horizon. window ideally
outdoors, without window. done anytime day. night, might little
challenging, goes following way. first do, close
eyes, done sitting standing. close eyes
focus much attention, including visual attention inner
landscape, interoception. breathing, heart rate,
maybe even surface skin, really focusing internally. Now, can
focus visual attention internally, eyes closed? Well,
imagining inner landscape. don't imagine heart beating
forth. trying eliminate perception outside world.
eliminating exteroception focusing cognitive attention
perceptual attention experiencing within confines skin
level surface skin inside body.


duration approximately three slow breaths. close eyes. breath one,
breath two breath three, concentrating attention internal landscape.
open eyes focus visual attention area
surface body. me, way typically this, will focus
on, say palm hand. focus visual attention palm hand.
three breaths again, focusing internal state, now splitting
little bit attention interoception exteroception. focusing something
outside me, ratio split attention 90, 10, 90% attention
focused internally, also focusing attention externally. people
can pretty easily. Then, third, call, station. now move visual
attention outside body, location room, outside
external environment, something range five 15 feet away. trying
move 90% attention external object. now really biasing
perception attention towards exteroception. breathe, paying attention
three breaths, still 10%, focused internal
landscape want pay attention three breasts. focusing

told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals

able carefully measure, much people recycling
call action recycle more. found was, said,
going try recycle more, try not put cans bottles trash.
course improvement recycling, pretty modest. Whereas

deliver one one's goal. Somewhat straightforward intuitive, nonetheless
worthwhile. suggests us, certain goals want
achieve, need exquisitely detailed action steps are,
going take constantly update action steps, higher

one assess progress? Well, course will depend given goal
trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly
good starting place, address well one performed previous week.

weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

01:39:50 Tool 9: Space-Time Bridging

study, point goal pursuit, goal assessment goal achievement. Previously
told you, great foreshadow failure. great way get system
state activation. also told want set goals, challenging
possible. again, here, paraphrasing work Emily Balcetis. want
clear. things one can order bias likelihood,
will succeed trying achieve goals. First all, limit options, trying
pursue many goals once, can definitely counter productive. Now realized
life complicated. multiple goals trying pursue,
particular goals important us, careful not get distracted
goals. many people run problem. setting one two maybe
three major goals given year, going enough people
actually going challenging people. Now, course daily goals
monthly goals yearly goals, big lofty goals, need careful
not contaminate mental space visual space many goals.
say visual goals? Well, various department stores supermarkets

trying pursue. studies referring here, assessment
progress updating concrete plans done weekly. seems like weekly

weekly seems like good solid rule thumb setting particular action goals

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

01:19:57 Dopamine, Motivation & Pleasure Seeking Goals

assessing one's progress towards immediate longer term goals.
discussion goals goal pursuit, incomplete without discussion
molecule, dopamine. Dopamine often thought molecule pleasure
reward, actually molecule motivation. best illustrated classic
set studies, carried animals humans. animal
study can described following way, two rats, separate cage. can
provide rats opportunity indulge something like, like food
mating. heat, cold environment, cool spot cage, warm
environment forth. find that, rats will readily approach
rewarding thing. will, mate. will eat. will pursue something
pleasure. Now, take one rats deplete dopamine neurons,
can eliminate dopamine neurons block dopamine brain. find,
animals will still enjoy pleasure. will consume food, will mate,


et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective

et cetera. However, motivation, achieve pleasure vastly reduced. fact,
place item pleasure, mate, food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away
rat, rat without dopamine will not even move one length body
order achieve pleasure. naturally occurring experiments humans
mimic result, accurately. certain conditions humans
depletion dopamine. find that, depletion dopamine
not inhibit ability experience pleasure, necessarily. inhibits ability
pursue go series action steps order achieve pleasure.
dopamine, really sits heart motivational state, seek goals seek
pleasure. true immediate goals take place within timeframe
minutes timeframe day, timeframe week timeframe
lifetime. Dopamine, common currency pursue goals. Now, dopamine
number things interesting. going describe
relate goal seeking behavior. First all, fundamental feature
brain releases uses dopamine, called, reward prediction error.
simplest way think dopamine reward prediction error, dopamine
released greatest amount

01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine

places us greater state motivation, something happens positive
novel. Now, important thing understand dopamine, not always
released schedule. couple different ways dopamine
released. released relative anticipation reward, key.
don't expect something positive happen, just going day
something positive happens, dopamine lot dopamine released.
happen recently. no idea going receiving something mail,
went mail. looked mail got something positive. really,
really excited this. real event happened, just today. However,
anticipate something positive going happen thing happens,
experience dopamine part anticipation. even get reward,
increase dopamine. not high be, something really novel
unexpected positive happened, get increase dopamine.
then, actually experience reward, experience positive thing,


smaller increase dopamine. again, biggest increases dopamine
response things positive unexpected. Lesser dopamine released
anticipate something good will happen happens, yes, get
dopamine. also get dopamine positive thing happens, think
anticipating great meal friends. dopamine churning,
friends come over, meal also get dopamine that,
not nearly much would, happened part big surprise.
Then, also case predict something good will happen,
happens, increase dopamine just before, thing
doesn't happen, instance, friends don't show dinner, drop
dopamine initial baseline. drop dopamine, chemical essence
call, disappointment. Now, dopamine reward prediction error, called,
can leveraged toward trying reach goals tells us
set milestones. can't mode simply focused finish line.
people can long periods time way effective. Now,
earlier talked study people focused finish line visually,
moving space ankle weights on, short-
term goal. So, goal within minutes, maybe even within hour
immediate visuals environment, maybe can that. goals sort
people pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship
goals, et cetera, involve milestones. So, understanding know
reward prediction error, can make better choices place
milestones, far future place milestones. question becomes,
often intervals one assess progress? turns
subjective, way make objective. Now, previous episode
"Huberman Lab Podcast", discussion great Robert Sapolsky
talking about, brain can subjectively change whether not given
behavior experience, positive negative. example Robert gave,
really phenomenal one. study done rats also humans
took rat rat run running wheel. Rats turns like run
running wheels blood pressure animal, health metrics animal,
lipid profiles, many, many things improved. rat exercising got
healthier presumably happier, don't know, could've asked it, wouldn't
know. doesn't know tell us, can measure blood lipids. can measure


blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

01:39:50 Tool 9: Space-Time Bridging



regulating dopamine system. want sure include tool,
especially powerful me, grounded neuroscience research
psychology research. describe tool next, think see ways
measures nicely work Emily Balcetis colleagues done.
something that, personally many years, based understanding
visual system understanding indeed can move cognition
perception place interoception focusing peripersonal space.
space within us immediately around us things immediately
accessible us. can shift mode mode exteroception
focusing things outside confines skin beyond reach,
literally goal directed behaviors goal directed thoughts. something
past, talked little bit talked something called,
space-time bridging. haven't talked much time domain visual
system today. space-time bridging, simply way using one's visual system
focus peripersonal space interoception. gradually deliberate
way, stepping one's focus extra personal space back
peripersonal space way gives lot flexibility control ability
daily life. So, going first describe tool, will explain
underlying science underlying mechanism.
this. indoors outdoors, although, ideally,
location view horizon. window ideally
outdoors, without window. done anytime day. night, might little
challenging, goes following way. first do, close
eyes, done sitting standing. close eyes
focus much attention, including visual attention inner
landscape, interoception. breathing, heart rate,
maybe even surface skin, really focusing internally. Now, can
focus visual attention internally, eyes closed? Well,
imagining inner landscape. don't imagine heart beating
forth. trying eliminate perception outside world.
eliminating exteroception focusing cognitive attention
perceptual attention experiencing within confines skin
level surface skin inside body.


duration approximately three slow breaths. close eyes. breath one,
breath two breath three, concentrating attention internal landscape.
open eyes focus visual attention area
surface body. me, way typically this, will focus
on, say palm hand. focus visual attention palm hand.
three breaths again, focusing internal state, now splitting
little bit attention interoception exteroception. focusing something
outside me, ratio split attention 90, 10, 90% attention
focused internally, also focusing attention externally. people
can pretty easily. Then, third, call, station. now move visual
attention outside body, location room, outside
external environment, something range five 15 feet away. trying
move 90% attention external object. now really biasing
perception attention towards exteroception. breathe, paying attention
three breaths, still 10%, focused internal
landscape want pay attention three breasts. focusing
much attention, outside myself, maintaining just little bit internal state,
can measure cadence three breaths. move visual attention
yet another station, away, typically, horizon something far off
distance, can possibly see. duration three breaths.
point, trying best move 99, not 100% attention external
location. then, typically will do, will try expand vision
cognition much broader sphere. that, magnocellular vision talked
before, not focusing particular location horizon. trying
dilate aperture field view, can see much visual landscape
possible. internal, excuse me, indoors, might
ceiling, walls floor environment in. outdoors,
expand visual focus broadly possibly can. Again,
duration three breaths, return immediately internal landscape.
close eyes three breasts focusing entirely
interoception, internal landscape called before, peripersonal
space. repeat that, peripersonal space, 100%, focus hand, 90%,
10% peripersonal space internal landscape. Stepping another
location mostly exteroception, maybe little bit recognition internal


state, horizon, broader visual sphere, back body.
work stations, maybe two three times. entire
thing takes 90 seconds three minutes, depending many breaths do.
said three, one 10. doesn't really matter. Or, also going
depend on, instance, slowly breathing. 'Cause breathing might
faster mine vice versa. doing? call space-time
bridging? useful goal setting? reason call space-time bridging,
visual system, not just analyzing space. actually batch
time. carve time. simple way state that, focus
visual attention narrow point, close body immediate
experience. tend slice time, finely. focused breathing.
focused heartbeats. fact, breathing internal landscape
heartbeats become sort seconds hand, will experience.
carving time, according immediate physiological experience. Whereas
focus visual attention outside body, not engage
exteroceptive, extra personal space system, start engage dopamine
system, goal-directed system, also start batching time differently.
focus visual system broader sphere space space beyond
confines skin, start carving time, frame rate changes. Now useful
context goal setting, goal assessment goal pursuit.
exception isolated examples, almost goals, involve setting goal,
off future, carving time now achievement
goal milestones, range duration. rewards, even try
just make every week, going come unexpected intervals
actually can helpful reinforcing behavior, intermittent reward. intermittent
random effective reward schedule know, problem always,
keep cognition line long-term goal also focused
immediate goals? particular practice, call space-time

essence goal directed behavior. essence setting goal.


thinking want. setting milestones intermediate

then, course updating goals, need update goals.
enormously confusing batch challenges, think once,
break elements, visual system can help find

blood pressure sorts things. indeed, rat exercised
people exercise, generally get healthier. Except, particular experiment,
another animal every time rat number one, ran, rat number two forced
run. running wheel forced run, not wanted to,
forced to. remarkable, physiological effects
forced something, complete opposite direction
behaviors undertaken voluntarily. words, rat
choosing run, got healthier rat forced run became unhealthy,
blood pressure went direction wasn't effective useful. Blood lipids got
worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. see thing
humans. Now, says, subjective understanding
something, fundamentally important effects will get behavior.
indeed effects behavior will us. two major
implications. First all, terms reward schedules, can decide use reward
schedule want given behavior. can decide milestones a...
say plan getting really terrific cardiovascular shape next year.
can decide assess every day ask good progress.
made progress, going reward ourselves. every third
day. every week. every five minutes, actually
time that. reward schedule, dopamine system, highly susceptible
subjective effects. so-called, top-down effects decide something
going good us, analyze given timeframe, well, going
good us. So, suggest people pick particular interval
going assess progress. making regular progress towards
goal reward reward indeed cognitive. mental.
telling yourself, yes, right track. Now, people will say, wait, want
know exactly often that. need interval can
maintain consistently. not going reward every minute every step
every jog take, unless can it, every minute every step every jog
take. reason, think daily ideally, weekly assessments going
best. think checking end week, looking back previous
week assessing well performed pursuit given goal. many times
week ran, many times studied, many times something
wanted avoided something didn't want do. think


reasonable tractable schedule assess week. one point, pick
milestone can maintain consistently throughout pursuit goal.
second thing, subjective effects described Sapolsky study
Sapolsky described rather, absolutely essential aspects goal seeking
behavior. cannot underestimate extent dopamine system
sense whether not right track, cognitive control.
constantly place mode thinking failing, well, indeed,
not going churn much dopamine. Now, earlier, said, need predict
visualize failure, not thing thinking failing.
need predict outcome failed, encountering
behaving certain way, thinking certain way, pursuing goals
effective way. Maybe checking week, definitely need reward
cognitively correct successful pursuit. means
anticipate think failure mechanism generating motivation indeed
fear anxiety, lean correct behaviors lean away
incorrect behaviors reach goal. weekly so, whatever can
maintain consistently, absolutely want reward cognitively telling
yourself, right track. got another week accomplish, whatever
trying accomplish. concrete example following now, 150 200
minutes zone two cardio per week, shown effective
improving mental physical health metrics. week, check myself.
reach 150 200 minutes threshold, reward simply checking off
box saying, okay, track. track. track. dopamine system
critical re-up, remind track, indeed track
dopamine provides state motivation readiness continue
regular pursuit goals. Dopamine, molecule, actually used manufacture
epinephrine norepinephrine. molecules brain body,
put us readiness action state. actually molecules
help generate increase systolic blood pressure, puts us state
readiness. can think dopamine self amplifying system, provided
leveraging dopamine system consistent schedule. Now, also
following consistent schedule self reward, set positive
unanticipated rewards, may happen. instance, checking
weekly, telling well, indeed are.


nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works

challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control

01:39:50 Tool 9: Space-Time Bridging



regulating dopamine system. want sure include tool,
especially powerful me, grounded neuroscience research
psychology research. describe tool next, think see ways
measures nicely work Emily Balcetis colleagues done.
something that, personally many years, based understanding
visual system understanding indeed can move cognition
perception place interoception focusing peripersonal space.
space within us immediately around us things immediately
accessible us. can shift mode mode exteroception
focusing things outside confines skin beyond reach,
literally goal directed behaviors goal directed thoughts. something
past, talked little bit talked something called,
space-time bridging. haven't talked much time domain visual
system today. space-time bridging, simply way using one's visual system
focus peripersonal space interoception. gradually deliberate
way, stepping one's focus extra personal space back
peripersonal space way gives lot flexibility control ability
daily life. So, going first describe tool, will explain
underlying science underlying mechanism.
this. indoors outdoors, although, ideally,
location view horizon. window ideally
outdoors, without window. done anytime day. night, might little
challenging, goes following way. first do, close
eyes, done sitting standing. close eyes
focus much attention, including visual attention inner
landscape, interoception. breathing, heart rate,
maybe even surface skin, really focusing internally. Now, can
focus visual attention internally, eyes closed? Well,
imagining inner landscape. don't imagine heart beating
forth. trying eliminate perception outside world.
eliminating exteroception focusing cognitive attention
perceptual attention experiencing within confines skin
level surface skin inside body.


duration approximately three slow breaths. close eyes. breath one,
breath two breath three, concentrating attention internal landscape.
open eyes focus visual attention area
surface body. me, way typically this, will focus
on, say palm hand. focus visual attention palm hand.
three breaths again, focusing internal state, now splitting
little bit attention interoception exteroception. focusing something
outside me, ratio split attention 90, 10, 90% attention
focused internally, also focusing attention externally. people
can pretty easily. Then, third, call, station. now move visual
attention outside body, location room, outside
external environment, something range five 15 feet away. trying
move 90% attention external object. now really biasing
perception attention towards exteroception. breathe, paying attention
three breaths, still 10%, focused internal
landscape want pay attention three breasts. focusing
much attention, outside myself, maintaining just little bit internal state,
can measure cadence three breaths. move visual attention
yet another station, away, typically, horizon something far off
distance, can possibly see. duration three breaths.
point, trying best move 99, not 100% attention external
location. then, typically will do, will try expand vision
cognition much broader sphere. that, magnocellular vision talked
before, not focusing particular location horizon. trying
dilate aperture field view, can see much visual landscape
possible. internal, excuse me, indoors, might
ceiling, walls floor environment in. outdoors,
expand visual focus broadly possibly can. Again,
duration three breaths, return immediately internal landscape.
close eyes three breasts focusing entirely
interoception, internal landscape called before, peripersonal
space. repeat that, peripersonal space, 100%, focus hand, 90%,
10% peripersonal space internal landscape. Stepping another
location mostly exteroception, maybe little bit recognition internal


state, horizon, broader visual sphere, back body.
work stations, maybe two three times. entire
thing takes 90 seconds three minutes, depending many breaths do.
said three, one 10. doesn't really matter. Or, also going
depend on, instance, slowly breathing. 'Cause breathing might
faster mine vice versa. doing? call space-time
bridging? useful goal setting? reason call space-time bridging,
visual system, not just analyzing space. actually batch
time. carve time. simple way state that, focus
visual attention narrow point, close body immediate
experience. tend slice time, finely. focused breathing.
focused heartbeats. fact, breathing internal landscape
heartbeats become sort seconds hand, will experience.
carving time, according immediate physiological experience. Whereas
focus visual attention outside body, not engage
exteroceptive, extra personal space system, start engage dopamine
system, goal-directed system, also start batching time differently.
focus visual system broader sphere space space beyond
confines skin, start carving time, frame rate changes. Now useful
context goal setting, goal assessment goal pursuit.
exception isolated examples, almost goals, involve setting goal,
off future, carving time now achievement
goal milestones, range duration. rewards, even try
just make every week, going come unexpected intervals
actually can helpful reinforcing behavior, intermittent reward. intermittent
random effective reward schedule know, problem always,
keep cognition line long-term goal also focused
immediate goals? particular practice, call space-time

different locations space therefore different locations time.
essence goal directed behavior. essence setting goal.


thinking want. setting milestones intermediate
goal. assessing whether not reaching milestones.
then, course updating goals, need update goals.
enormously confusing batch challenges, think once,
break elements, visual system can help find

control visual system, indeed yours, can deliberately set
different locations. make practice stepping different

nowhere, instance, run something, using fitness
example. something, find performing particularly well,
unexpected dopamine reward will amplify system. Now know
many people there, heard talk dopamine before, worry, well, can
release much dopamine whole system will crash run
motivation? general, doesn't happen unless people using pharmacology,
supplements prescription drugs illicit drugs increase dopamine.
big fan things like, cold showers cold water exposure, shown
lead long-lasting 2.5 X increases dopamine, cases, supplementation
things like L-Tyrosine, precursors dopamine. cases,
caffeine, can increase number dopamine receptors have,
whatever dopamine floating around can effective activating
motivational states. things really increase dopamine cause crash,
can problematic. One way conceive dopamine, sort dopamine wave
pool. probably seen wave pools, pressure pushed
pool get waves going. waves consistent enough,
high enough amplitude, waves can continue go
down. giant wave, get huge blast dopamine, well bunch
water sloshes wave pool basically take time
off, reset dopamine level. happens addiction people start
pushing lot drugs things system increase dopamine
much. today almost exclusively talking behavioral tools.
possible incorporate supplements things sort, can increase dopamine
way getting ongoing motivational states. caution people relying
much. Really want, want situation
positive feedback, understanding, reaching milestones
set yourself. achieving those, causing
waves

01:34:26 Dopamine Influences Vision & Vice Versa

increases dopamine will amplify motivational states. Another
interesting aspect dopamine not talked podcast
before, actually dopamine system interacts visual system.


talked lot harnessing visual attention, particular point great
can help serve ability set achieve goals. Really wonderful work
done Wolfram Schultz, one great pioneers area dopamine
dopamine reward prediction error, showed people normal levels
dopamine, visual search, meaning scanned visual environments, tends
pretty constrained. might move eyes around particular visual
environment, searching somewhat. people lack dopamine, actually
little movement eyes. don't actually tend look far
horizon. don't focused vergence point talking
kind a... guess lack better phrase, kind eye tiger, focus
goal. Rather, eye movements depleted not actually evaluating
horizons off future, not focused much extrapersonal space.
actually can restored took place Parkinson's patients
people dopamine depleted, dopamine restored
pharmacologically, visual focus re-enhanced again. Now, lot details
study don't map perfectly onto everything talked about. point
this, focused particular point visual space particular goal
horizon. systems, blood pressure, epinephrine indeed dopamine, get
recruited put us state readiness willingness go pursue things
extrapersonal space. visual attention diffuse, relaxes,
tend comfortable staying place are, peripersonal space
effect works direction too. dopamine increased, visual
attention particular things space, increase. way works reciprocal.
use visual system particular way, bring point focus,
recruits chemical neural systems brain body put us state
readiness pursuit. And, increase certain chemicals brain body,
like epinephrine, like dopamine, also allow visual system state
looking particular locations visual world. system works
directions people leverage using things like caffeine taking things
like L-Tyrosine increase dopamine. again, works ways, no right
wrong way it. particular fan using behavioral tools, always prior using
supplementation kinds tools behavioral tools unique
feature supplementation chemical tools don't. behavioral
tools used time, engage neuroplasticity. start practice, using visual


system harness attention particular locations way, move
particular goals, get better better using systems. fact, systems
focus motivation, plasticity, get better motivated
focused place visual attention given location. Using chemical
assistance safe kind, course, check doctor. things like L-Tyrosine
caffeine combined, yes, will increase dopamine will increase ability,
engage visual focus somewhat. compounds alone, don't modify circuitry
way want. always say, behavioral tools first, nutritional tools,
supplementation tools right safe,

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

01:38:10 Interim Summary Goal-Pursuit Steps

maybe advance sophisticated tools. like just briefly
recap covered now. again, emphasize much
covered based beautiful work Emily Balcetis colleagues.
hope get guest podcast, way. First all, set goals
challenging, possible, moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult.
moderately challenging goals, seem effective moving people towards
goals short longterm. Second, plan concretely, need concrete
set actions going follow order reach goals. Third, foreshadow
failure. somewhat surprising one me. anticipated, imagining
success way go. turns imagining success visualizing success,
can useful outset goal maybe every pursuit
goal. not terrific putting constant pursuit goal, rather,
foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure terrible things going bring,
seems effective. maps well known neural
circuitry involvement amygdala. Focus particular visual points way
harness attention remove distractors. Removing distractors getting
body brain mode activation. Getting healthy increase systolic
blood pressure, puts forward motion towards goals, absolutely key.
brief summary covered now. things too,
course, dopamine system power subjective top-down control
