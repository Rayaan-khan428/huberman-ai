00:11:20 Immune System Basics: Skin/Mucous, Innate & Adaptive Immune System

like shift conversation to. first topic attack
question immune system work? think many
heard antibodies killer cells various organs body involved
immune system, like bone marrow, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes.
like just take moment sort brief immune system 101; really simple,
cover basic elements immune system everyone listening watching
can get clear sense immune system functions basic parts
are. you, might basic. might little bit background


already know. think you, information will new. promise
you, don't need biology medicine background order understand this.
actually really simple truly elegant design. three main layers
defense health. three things constantly work protect
invasion illness bacteria, viruses, parasites.
first three physical barrier call skin. might seem kind
obvious, everything contained compartment boundaried
skin. skin important aspect immune system.
ever cut, essentially breach boundary immune
system, notice number things happen. might get
swelling around cut. might get scab, likely get scab time.
got dirty, bacteria got there, might see accumulation
white blood cells, called puss. know kind gross, is.
might take yellow tint accumulation dead cells there.
basically skin primary barrier keep things outside
harm getting inside. Now, still category one, body
external surface, openings surface, right? not just round
body shaped completely covered skin. openings,
openings? Well, start top work way down. primary site potential
infection eyes. ears, nostrils,
mouth. Okay, going primary sites things can get
system. need put things system; need drink eat,
need get light system. openings, bad things,
meaning things can harm you, can get systems. course,
along back throat, way stomach digestive
system, intestines rectum, tube,
basically series tubes. said podcast, one
tube extract nutrients outside environment. along tube,
including nose mouth, lined mucus. mucus might seem
kind gross you, learn mucus, realize
mucus really, really cool mucus essentially acts filter, trap
bacteria viruses. certain ways scrubbing killing bacteria
viruses. Now, mucus constantly turned over, talk later,
chemistry mucus really important order make sure certain things don't


make system, things allowed move system
can extract nutrients them. reason talking first category
barrier immune system detail like envision human,
course, human clear entity everything else.
bring right things keep wrong things kill them. Now,
inevitably, bacteria, viruses, parasitic infections going make way
body, whether not killed off whether not take cause us
harm going determined layers two three. So, layers two three
so-called innate immune system adaptive immune system. innate
immune system call second layer defense. fast.
whether not bacteria, virus, parasite, happens something
enter body, maybe swallowed it, maybe got eyes, maybe
shook somebody's hand carrying particular kind illness, wiped
eyes. talked podcast before, soon meet another
person, usually within 30 seconds, believe not, people wipe person's
chemicals somewhere face body's surface.
demonstrated again. want learn that,
episode chemical signaling, can learn it. know sounds
weird might say, "I don't that," indeed do, time
everybody does. Okay, so, innate immune system rapid response
something enters system body doesn't recognize it. not food, not
clean air, something either bacteria, virus parasite. innate immune
system involves release

00:17:08 Killer Cells, Complement Proteins (“Eat Me!” Signals), Cytokines (“Help Me!”
Signals)

particular cells waiting dormant, ready attack whatever invader is.
cell types heard before. typical one so-called
white blood cells. So, white blood cells will actively go site invasion will
start encapsulate try surround given invader. names
different cell types things like neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells just
many types immune cells. kind like ambulance system,
rather go try heal something like paramedic would, go


try surround kill whatever invader is. work concert two
assistants, assistants called compliment proteins. Compliment
proteins exist blood, travel sites
invasion mark certain things engulfed eaten. sort put
"eat me" tag it. basically put chemical tag onto invaders allows
white blood cells, neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells say, "Ah, need
basically kill thing, wrap body bag send off. Kill thing,
wrap body bag send off." using analogy body bag,
sense right one rather cells come kill things, way
actually engulf invading bacteria, virus parasite. actually
surround it. see puss see infection maybe cut skin
something like that, even ingrown hair gets bacteria it, puss
white part, know kind gross talk about, white blood
cells, oftentimes dead cells, dead invader sitting there. trying
create isolated compartment 'cause wants keep part body. Okay,
got innate immune system, compliment comes blood
helps tagging certain things "eat me" signal. cells
either damaged injury parasite, suffering
bacteria virus itself, cells body will also release alarm
signal, not "eat me" signal, "help me" signal. "help me"
signals come form call cytokines. cytokines things like
interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha. may heard
things curious learning health space,
online health space, especially last years, inflammation buzz word
now. Everyone's talking inflammation, inflammation, inflammation.
mean say inflammation? Well, inflammation physical response, also
chemical response. many times markers inflammation measured
people animal models research done, things like interleukin-1,
interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha. go blood, sign
somewhere cell saying "help me, help me." secreting
things calls neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells, white blood
cells, okay? might help remember this, just telling people
interleukin means communicate, right? interleukin shouting "help me,"
compliment proteins coming saying, "eat this" tagging invader


"eat me" signal. killer cells white blood cells
job trying kill off thing. innate immune system. So, skin
mucus lining plus innate immune system beautiful two-layered

00:21:06 Adaptive Immune System: Antibodies

set defenses various kinds invaders infections.
third type, adaptive immune system. notice leading
now, haven't said word antibody all, job not
skin mucus microbiome innate immune system produce antibodies
can recognize specific invaders, rather job adaptive immune
system create antibodies bacteria, viruses, even parasites even
physical intruders system. So, adaptive immune system incredible
ability show site invasion infection inflammation. called
various cues, including cytokines talked earlier.
actually attaches creates sort imprint shape whatever invader
happens there. particular invading bacteria virus contour
kind rippled kind spiky whatever shape happens have, creates
imprint that. then, using imprint concert cells, creates
antibodies specific recognize invader body ever
invader inside again. Now, called adaptive immune system.
many ways creates memory prior infection antibodies can made
anytime invader comes back again, right? so, basis
call immunity. basis call enhanced ability combat certain
types infections. really wonderful, mean, can't even state
incredible really is, bodies capacity, right?
something called leukocytes. essentially white blood cells. red blood
cells white blood cells, derived type origin cell.
stem cell. hear stem cell, stem cell just means cell can become
many different types cells. sometimes hear stem cells terms
people getting injections stem cells potential therapeutic effects
potential stem cells. harbor certain stem cells within us well, can
become lots different cell types. one particular type stem cell,
hematopoietic stem cell, can give rise red blood cells white blood cells.


general, reside marrow, least adults. So, bone marrow,
ability make certain cells can go called
chemically, get called sites infection create antibodies,
maintain antibodies system, memory particular infection
infection comes back again, can kill off immediately. doesn't
pass multiple stages first, innate response, adaptive
response, taking time. Now, lot details adaptive immune
system, just want emphasize points might relevant. First all,
name antibodies created sometimes come form IgM IgG,
things sort. isn't full deep dive immunology class, Ig stands
immunoglobulin, okay? immunoglobulins part adaptive immune
response creating antibodies. hear IgM, IgM first adaptive
immune responses, tends come earlier. somebody immunopositive
IgM particular type viral bacterial invader, means fairly
recent infection. Later, one creates... adaptive immune system, say,
creates IgG, stable form specific antibody going
recognize given invader. IgG tends come little bit later. So, just recap,
something gets system eyes, hole skin,
cut, mouth, sexually transmitted diseases come mucus
membranes genitalia genitalia, sexually transmitted disease,
airborne disease, gets mucus, somehow gets bloodstream.
innate response, general response trying contain combat
infection invader. adaptive response one generates
antibodies. First, IgM response, immunoglobulin-M response,
immunoglobulin-G response, IgG response. So, keep three barriers
three defense systems infection tuned up? Well, leaving aside list things
mentioned generally enhances function, things like sleep
sunlight good nutrition, et cetera, sort generic things good health, one
key ways can keep mucus lining really good shape.
mean? Well, mucus lining needs turn quite often needs
correct chemistry trap bad stuff permeable good
stuff, nutrients need. now clear hundreds, not
thousands studies best way maintain healthy so-called
microbiome. microbiome little bacterial organisms good us


live along mucus pathways even eyes. Now, just really clear,
not just gut microbiome; actually microbiome eyes,
one specific mouth, nasal specific microbiome, one
along gut species microbiota live along digestive tract differ
mouth, throat, stomach, intestines, rectum. well-
established healthy microbiota live along length,
differ along length. also urethral microbiota, vaginal
microbiota promotes health environment well. one can
maintain healthy microbiota not favor growth harmful bacteria, allow
mucus lining become permeable bad stuff can come
environment?

00:28:00 Tool 1: Nasal Microbiome “Scrubbing” Bacteria & Viruses; Nasal Breathing

Well, far know, three main ways that. first two purely
structural mechanical. clear now work, done
Stanford, elsewhere well, nasal microbiome particularly good
scrubbing bacteria, preventing certain types infections. So, reminder
whenever possible, unless eating speaking, want nasal breathing, not
breathing mouth. nose much better filter viruses bacteria
mouth. mouth contains certain structural features, even organs cell
types can protect incoming infection, don't want mouth
breather variety reasons. terrific book called "Jaws: Hidden
Epidemic," written colleagues, Sandra Kahn Paul Ehrlich
Stanford, Stanford Medicine foreword Jared Diamond Robert
Sapolsky. really lot heavy hitters book talks increase
infection one gets breathing mouth, opposed nose. Now,
course, hard exercise, one breathes mouth, not necessarily
bad. one eating speaking, not necessarily bad all. guess depends
saying. joke. general, possible want
breathing nose. Many people trouble breathing nose
so-called deviated septums chronically collapsed sinuses. best way
dilate sinuses actually breathe nose. can take little bit
time, plasticity sinuses. so, nose breather, not mouth


breather, will combat infections constantly confronted with.
mention always bombarded different types bacteria, viruses,
parasites environment. goal course, reinforce immune
system, can keep things bay not get sick. actually paper
published Cell Reports, "Cell Press Journal," excellent journal showed
nasal microbiome, particular species microbiota good fighting
off infection. not direct link particular patterns nasal
breathing nasal microbiome yet, oxygenation environment
breathing nose, turns quite important overall enhancing
filter. don't just think nose something

00:30:33 Tools 2 & 3: (Not) Touching Eyes; Gut Microbiome & Fermented Foods

smell foods bring air. also active filter things invade you.
way try keep bad things avoid getting sick advice
mother, certainly mother gave me, not touch eyes
touching people touching surfaces. mentioned earlier, tend
subconsciously. reason avoid eyes primary entry
point lot bacteria viruses. constantly lubricating surface
eyes so-called lacrimal glands, tears things sort. ever
noticed wake morning, sleep eyes, know
kind crusty stuff corners eyes eyelashes, sleep,
crust actually dead bacteria successfully battled night. Okay,
is. not accumulation healthy tissue. accumulation
healthy mucus membranes tears things specifically
combating bacteria. So, know sounds little bit gross, is.
wiping away casualties battle fought night.
daytime, don't want introduce viruses things eyes much
possible. primary site entry. people wear goggles surgical units
things sort, try avoid getting things eyes. Very,
important. third way keep healthy line defense entire mucus
tract enhance proliferation good gut microbiota. best way enhance
quality gut microbiome mucus lining serves protective layer
along body ingest two four servings day fermented foods, low sugar


fermented foods. talked bunch times podcast,
data colleague, Justin Sonnenburg's lab Stanford Med. there, just
wiped eyes. Yep, got me. paper published journal "Cell,"
absolutely spectacular journal, really points fact people eat fermented
foods, two four servings per day, helps reduce activity certain cytokines. Now,
know are, right? Cells make cytokines call out, "help me, help me."
reduce amount cytokines, so-called inflammatom. Now doesn't render
cells vulnerable. reason saw reduction IL-6 IL-1,
cytokines people healthy gut microbiome,
fewer cells body infected outside infections therefore less
reason cells crying out, "help," thriving, not suffering. So,
don't wipe eyes, keep hands clean, everyone tells that, right? keep
hands clean, don't wipe eyes, nasal breather, not mouth breather,
unless speaking, exercising eating, keep healthy gut microbiome
eating two four servings day quality, low sugar, fermented foods, things like
sauerkraut, things like natto can access that. tried before, interesting.
sort acquired taste, kimchi, pickles, again, low sugar sources going
sources going effective this. now armed three ways
enhance function immune system combat infection is, like
think separate typical type information get get good sleep,
good nutrition, good social connection, et cetera. stuff still holds true,
three points think can really make

00:34:20 Interleukins Anti-Inflammatory

substantial difference terms bolstering immune system, immune system.
want mention, names going come several times
episode, interleukins like IL-6 IL-1 encourage inflammation,
"help me" signals call cells gobble invaders.
interleukins anti-inflammatory. one like highlight particular,
will come little bit interleukin-10. not IL, insert
number, not interleukins inflammatory, anti-inflammatory.

00:34:56 Sickness Behavior



important point keep mind go forward. Next, like talk
called sickness behavior. indeed category behavior call
sickness behavior informative things can avoid getting
sick. Now, notion sickness behavior goes back several decades more.
interesting way looking function immune system,
bridges us thing calling immune system T-
cells, B-cells, cytokines leukocytes, starts taking us realm
nervous system, course nervous system controls behavior.
sickness behavior suite responses tend undergo
feeling sick. going vary person person, general
categories things happen us wounded
sick dealing infection kind. examining sickness behavior
detail, can really informative routes can take health.
main thing sickness behavior tends involve slowing usual
levels activity. People start feel lethargic, feel like activities
previously relative ease difficult somewhat
overwhelming. thing start see people animals, way,
stop grooming, stop taking care themselves. Not necessarily stopped showering,
although oftentimes case, will stop hair, stop putting
makeup, depending whether not before, might stop. Animals
will stop licking grooming themselves. People will stop taking care cosmetic
appearance. Now not just don't care look sick,
overall suppression certain kinds activities
enhancement kinds activities. really important. Sickness behavior
actually motivated state. state designed accomplish certain things.
One features sickness behavior addition lethargic, loss
grooming, will loss appetite, right? Oftentimes people great appetite
normally just won't feel hungry all. several theories
be. One prominent idea literature discourage vomiting diarrhea,
course can infectious people. So, theory. don't know
ever tested directly, one idea. idea simply
harbor resources sake repair. want talk
told get extra sleep aren't feeling well rest. just like good two


three-year-old constantly asks, "why, why?" Good scientists, good people
interested health information always asking why. get
sleep? happens sleep get sleep sick?
shouldn't just push this? couple reasons
established literature. first seem something
useful slowing circulation ill. One idea data support
slow circulation, blood circulation, not running around
much running all, rather lying down, getting extra rest, maybe sleeping, maybe
even just remaining still, lymphatic system, carries lot immune-
related cells fluids, able ramp levels activity. So, interesting,
right? reducing circulation blood, increasing circulation lymphatic
system. probably familiar lymphatic system
combating infection, lymph nodes can get sore. got lymph nodes behind
ears, groin, armpits, around throat,

00:39:08 People Seek Care Sick, Others Want Alone

around near thyroid, throat, et cetera. So, reason. Now,
people, get sick, psychologically go vulnerable state
really, really want people, people take care them. probably
witnessed this, feel way yourself. 50% people response.
really want taken care of. Now, think adaptive
perspective, makes sense, right? member species ill
less will cry help one form another members species
take care them. course will especially apparent cases people
young enough incapacitated enough can't actually get resources
own. ever really sick, just getting going fridge
restroom can feel like monumental task. 50% people report describe
seeking help support sick. also imagine
non-adaptive response increases opportunity spread
infection caretaker. interesting consideration. Another 50% people
seem opposite response sick. So, somehow, regardless
prior getting ill, sickness behavior engaged neural
circuits brain, indeed neural circuits brain, create stay away


me. don't want bothered. want left alone. don't want taken care of,
right? not stubbornness. literally lack interest disinterest social
connection one sick. see animals too, animals will seek
members species. Others, like unfortunately now passed away
bulldog, Costello. sick always knew go around
back house just hide there. just take away
everybody else. not want taken care of. just natural response
him. don't think trying prevent getting whatever had.
ever somebody doesn't want taken care of, want taken care
of, realize people tend fall two bins naturally, animals tend fall
bins. Regardless species are, 50/50. again,
sickness behavior motivated state. designed slow circulation blood,
increase circulation lymph, killer cells body, reduce
probability infecting others reducing, thought, diarrhea vomit, also
breathing others, interacting others. cases will activate this, don't
want call regressed state, many people feel somewhat more...
adults, feel childlike ill want

00:42:00 Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines

taken care badly. might learned. might innate.
don't know, sickness behavior interesting couple reasons.
First all, mimics another state described neuroscience literature,
major depression. sick individuals, sick bacterial viral
infection, people major depression, shown robust
increases levels interleukin-6 tumor necrosis factor alpha.
idea now circulating depression involves inflammatory cytokines
active. know illness involves inflammatory cytokines active.
think it, similarity major depression sick
able point us direction interventions help us either prevent illness
move illness quickly. head direction, indeed
case, just want emphasize sickness behavior provides
bridge immune system nervous system. soon see
also healthy behavior, behavior allows us avoid infection, also points


clear bridge nervous system immune system. isn't just
brain body organs, immune system.
true, interacting time. going lead us place
going clear not surprising certain patterns thinking
certain behaviors

00:43:40 Reduced Appetites Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido

can elect take can help enhance immune system function vice versa.
two features sickness behavior definitely worth pointing out. One
theory, reduced appetite, particular appetite protein rich foods
sick, thought attempt, subconscious attempt, organism
reduce amount iron taking in. Now, typically amount iron intake
recommended less men, eight milligrams per day.
women, anywhere 18 27 milligrams per day, depending whether not
pregnant, lactating menstruating, et cetera, ranges can vary. But,
indeed, true iron levels blood go high, like 45 milligrams per day
can toxic system. theory prominent biology literature
health literature reduction appetite actually attempt
reduce iron intake specifically many bacteria forms infection seem
thrive levels iron blood high. don't want see anyone take
extreme suddenly iron deprivation diet order get well.
interesting theory remiss didn't mention, makes good sense.
Iron actually attached hemoglobin red blood cells bloodstream. Normally
can help us quite lot. also muscle, mention that. Iron can
sequestered muscle, iron serves lot important health promoting roles,
reducing appetite thereby reducing iron intake, reduce capacity
certain things, including infections travel certain compartments within body. So,
again, just theory, think many probably familiar not
appetite sick. thing typical people major
depression loss appetite, not always often loss appetite. So, again,
loss appetite sickness behavior, loss appetite major depression,
perhaps not surprisingly one major symptoms sickness behavior major
depression map less onto one another loss libido interest, not just


social interactions, sex reproduction. so, again, think
sickness behavior depression, very, similar. Okay, sickness
behavior major depression certain core features common. need
therefore ask sick influence way think
perceive environment impact appetite, whether not want
cared cared less? Again, people tend diverge two different bins
there,

00:46:45 Vagus-Nerve Stimulation: Fever, Photophobia, Sleepiness

believe not, pathway identified. infection
someplace body, head, sinus infection,
ear infection, also mention many mechanisms can
also consequence wound injury body. back injury slipped
disc guess called herniated disc way hear described.
that, can kind irritable, don't want certain things just want
left alone. Things harder. How? Why? Well, known pathway,
so-called vagus nerve connects body brain, signals particular
brain sites engage category motivational state call sickness behavior.
Many probably heard vagus, V-A-G-U-S, vagus. vagus nerve
extensive nerve pathway, 10th cranial nerve comes back
brainstem, heads body, branches extensively innervate connect
many organs, including lungs, heart, gut, et cetera.
organs able also send neural signals back brain. sometimes hear
vagus route calming down. Unfortunately, less
myth don't know got propagated. lots different pathways
vagus Usually vagal stimulation actually creates arousal alertness, although
multiple pathways, now many studies vagus
various contexts, including sickness behavior. clear vagus nerve
fast pathway infection body signaled brain,
particular location brain called hypothalamus, harbors lot different
types neurons. Neurons, instance, preoptic area increase body
temperature fever, right? one important things increase body
temperature, body's attempt kill off invader many viruses


many bacteria don't survive well elevated heat. function fever. fever
actually functional role. So, biology, like complicated words, call
anything increases body temperature creates fever, pyrogen. Many years
ago, undergraduate years, working pyrogens, injecting something called
lipopolysaccharide belly, gives fever. way
LPS causes inflammation response gut. gut doesn't know
happening. stomach cells don't know happening. just start secreting
IL-6, IL-1, cytokines, killer cells migrate gut.
sometimes get stomach ache don't feel well, flu, something
like it. neural signal, electrical signals get sent hypothalamus.
hypothalamus says, oh, don't know going there, signal
something's going on. just heat body. just start cooking whatever
there. course don't want fever go high can kill brain
cells. within particular range fever functional adaptive response, okay?
taking drugs try lower fever might make feel
comfortable, actually limiting response body creating order
try kill off invader. again, don't want fever go high. going
vary depending age. can look online tolerable ranges
fever. trying lower body temperature fever, unless
heading dangerous levels heating up, actually wrong way take
system indeed want kill off invader. Okay, vagus nerve
quick response. also sends input areas brain change perception
outside world. One obvious these, obvious tell you,
photophobia, right? love bright sunshine. love bright lights want alert.
different levels light sensitivity, people sick,
inflammation response body, feel like bright lights kind
aversive. get well-described kind classical photophobia, mediated
pathway goes eye area thalamus, called anterior
nucleus thalamus. work done Clifford Saper Harvard
Medical School. really beautiful work. outer lining
brain, meninges just sort outside brain brain starts
interface connective tissues. talk later.
can actually create photophobia headache one ill. So,
pathway: invader gets system 'cause wiped eyes got


mouth. didn't listen mother got eyes.
feeling sick. Something's going there. stomach ache
inflammation there, signal goes vagus nerve. heating
fever. got photophobia activated pathway
normally tolerable light triggering thalamic nucleus, anterior
thalamus, projecting meninges. got headache response
looking light. basically triggering overall pathway get go quiet,
dark place rest. last element like talk rest.
something gets triggered body brain, hypothalamus,
think know hypothalamic area is. supraoptic nucleus, think.
Supraoptic 'cause right so-called optic chiasm, want look
is, right roof mouth. nuclei
promote desire sleep even daytime, normally active
phase circadian cycle.

00:53:03 Humoral (Blood-Borne) Factors, & Choroid Change Brain State

Now, really interesting happening got multiple
pathways saying avoid light, reduce amount behavior, heat up,
things making sick. sickness behavior, going body
mind make right thing. Now also slow pathway
purely mediated blood, so-called humoral factors. Not 'cause funny,
humoral factors factors blood. infection many hours
days, amount IL-6 IL-1 tumor necrosis factor inflammatory
cytokines starting increase total amount circulation gets high
enough communicated brain. tends enter brain
particular type tissue really interesting called choroid, C-H-O-R-O-I-D. Choroid
really interesting. kind fluffy tissue sits ventricles. ventricles
spaces brain, spaces brain called cerebral
spinal fluid them. cerebral spinal fluid contains number important things,
choroid starts releasing responding cytokines, inflammatory
cytokines, brain actually starts experience sorts changes terms
inflammation neurons, memory tends get poor, cognition tends get
poor. transient things often. Eventually things will pass,


deep sickness really feeling lousy. can't read, can't watch
movie, can't anything. ever get sick just can't bothered
anything, probably fast response body
also slower response literally set tissues brain
sending inflammatory signals. now whole brain starting
cope,

00:55:04 Tools 4, 5: Reducing Sickness: Glymphatic Clearance, Pre-Sleep Serotonin,
5HTP

trying cope infection. got slow pathway fast pathway.
sounds really terrible. So, now, like talk can reduce
probability getting sick. actually things one can start
get sick sick, accelerate healing process flipping
equation. now talking body activates certain areas
brain create sickness behavior much like depression. probably
familiar anytime cold flu something really lousy

throat, breathe, nasal passages don't feel way. got
little bit headache. feeling kind off. know do.
hydrate, drink water go sleep. Right, told,
actually things can actively order get immune system
deploy robust response early phase potential infection. focus first
rest component. Yes, course told take hot shower
go sleep, get nine 10 hours sleep. interesting way
looking sleep, specifically role enhancing immune system.
wonderful review, put review captions looked specifically
literature surrounding sleep different occurs support immune
system. normally go sleep, slow-wave sleep predominantly
early phase night, time sleep longer longer, get
so-called REM, rapid eye movement sleep. talked episodes


sleep. course slow-wave sleep REM sleep throughout night
always, fraction slow-wave sleep REM sleep shifts,
different functions, et cetera. evidence sleep associated
infection, particular, early stage infection, associated elevated levels
serotonin brain either adaptive mechanism whatever reason,
neurons brain so-called raphe nucleus start releasing serotonin.
serotonin related pathways can help enhance immune
system function combat infection. starting data,
emphasize starting not robust literature yet, looking whether not
supplementing precursors serotonin like 5-HTP, can taken supplement
form consuming foods increase serotonin naturally. foods
contain high levels tryptophan. can look are. So, white meat
turkey, instance, certain complex carbohydrates can often rich tryptophan.
consuming foods can enhance amount serotonin available
brain blood thereby lead particular quality sleep allows
deep healing say deep healing, mean robust immune
response. Now, again, still emerging data. clear, however,
sleep particular, sleep associated early stage
kind viral bacterial infection, so-called glymphatic system much active
normally. glymphatic system? glymphatic system
actually relatively recent discovery. mentioned lymph lymphatic system
earlier, glymphatic system G, system brain debris
accumulates throughout day, particular, debris accumulates
conditions neuroinflammation inflammation body, cleared
washed brain. activity glymphatic system extremely important

couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard

case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4

remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling

want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types

doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,

So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies

effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,

published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start

00:11:20 Immune System Basics: Skin/Mucous, Innate & Adaptive Immune System

like shift conversation to. first topic attack
question immune system work? think many
heard antibodies killer cells various organs body involved
immune system, like bone marrow, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes.
like just take moment sort brief immune system 101; really simple,
cover basic elements immune system everyone listening watching
can get clear sense immune system functions basic parts
are. you, might basic. might little bit background


already know. think you, information will new. promise
you, don't need biology medicine background order understand this.
actually really simple truly elegant design. three main layers
defense health. three things constantly work protect
invasion illness bacteria, viruses, parasites.
first three physical barrier call skin. might seem kind
obvious, everything contained compartment boundaried
skin. skin important aspect immune system.
ever cut, essentially breach boundary immune
system, notice number things happen. might get
swelling around cut. might get scab, likely get scab time.
got dirty, bacteria got there, might see accumulation
white blood cells, called puss. know kind gross, is.
might take yellow tint accumulation dead cells there.
basically skin primary barrier keep things outside
harm getting inside. Now, still category one, body
external surface, openings surface, right? not just round
body shaped completely covered skin. openings,
openings? Well, start top work way down. primary site potential
infection eyes. ears, nostrils,
mouth. Okay, going primary sites things can get
system. need put things system; need drink eat,
need get light system. openings, bad things,
meaning things can harm you, can get systems. course,
along back throat, way stomach digestive
system, intestines rectum, tube,
basically series tubes. said podcast, one
tube extract nutrients outside environment. along tube,
including nose mouth, lined mucus. mucus might seem
kind gross you, learn mucus, realize
mucus really, really cool mucus essentially acts filter, trap
bacteria viruses. certain ways scrubbing killing bacteria
viruses. Now, mucus constantly turned over, talk later,
chemistry mucus really important order make sure certain things don't


make system, things allowed move system
can extract nutrients them. reason talking first category
barrier immune system detail like envision human,
course, human clear entity everything else.
bring right things keep wrong things kill them. Now,
inevitably, bacteria, viruses, parasitic infections going make way
body, whether not killed off whether not take cause us
harm going determined layers two three. So, layers two three
so-called innate immune system adaptive immune system. innate
immune system call second layer defense. fast.
whether not bacteria, virus, parasite, happens something
enter body, maybe swallowed it, maybe got eyes, maybe
shook somebody's hand carrying particular kind illness, wiped
eyes. talked podcast before, soon meet another
person, usually within 30 seconds, believe not, people wipe person's
chemicals somewhere face body's surface.
demonstrated again. want learn that,
episode chemical signaling, can learn it. know sounds
weird might say, "I don't that," indeed do, time
everybody does. Okay, so, innate immune system rapid response
something enters system body doesn't recognize it. not food, not
clean air, something either bacteria, virus parasite. innate immune
system involves release

00:17:08 Killer Cells, Complement Proteins (“Eat Me!” Signals), Cytokines (“Help Me!”
Signals)

particular cells waiting dormant, ready attack whatever invader is.
cell types heard before. typical one so-called
white blood cells. So, white blood cells will actively go site invasion will
start encapsulate try surround given invader. names
different cell types things like neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells just
many types immune cells. kind like ambulance system,
rather go try heal something like paramedic would, go


try surround kill whatever invader is. work concert two
assistants, assistants called compliment proteins. Compliment
proteins exist blood, travel sites
invasion mark certain things engulfed eaten. sort put
"eat me" tag it. basically put chemical tag onto invaders allows
white blood cells, neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells say, "Ah, need
basically kill thing, wrap body bag send off. Kill thing,
wrap body bag send off." using analogy body bag,
sense right one rather cells come kill things, way
actually engulf invading bacteria, virus parasite. actually
surround it. see puss see infection maybe cut skin
something like that, even ingrown hair gets bacteria it, puss
white part, know kind gross talk about, white blood
cells, oftentimes dead cells, dead invader sitting there. trying
create isolated compartment 'cause wants keep part body. Okay,
got innate immune system, compliment comes blood
helps tagging certain things "eat me" signal. cells
either damaged injury parasite, suffering
bacteria virus itself, cells body will also release alarm
signal, not "eat me" signal, "help me" signal. "help me"
signals come form call cytokines. cytokines things like
interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha. may heard
things curious learning health space,
online health space, especially last years, inflammation buzz word
now. Everyone's talking inflammation, inflammation, inflammation.
mean say inflammation? Well, inflammation physical response, also
chemical response. many times markers inflammation measured
people animal models research done, things like interleukin-1,
interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha. go blood, sign
somewhere cell saying "help me, help me." secreting
things calls neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells, white blood
cells, okay? might help remember this, just telling people
interleukin means communicate, right? interleukin shouting "help me,"
compliment proteins coming saying, "eat this" tagging invader


"eat me" signal. killer cells white blood cells
job trying kill off thing. innate immune system. So, skin
mucus lining plus innate immune system beautiful two-layered

00:21:06 Adaptive Immune System: Antibodies

set defenses various kinds invaders infections.
third type, adaptive immune system. notice leading
now, haven't said word antibody all, job not
skin mucus microbiome innate immune system produce antibodies
can recognize specific invaders, rather job adaptive immune
system create antibodies bacteria, viruses, even parasites even
physical intruders system. So, adaptive immune system incredible
ability show site invasion infection inflammation. called
various cues, including cytokines talked earlier.
actually attaches creates sort imprint shape whatever invader
happens there. particular invading bacteria virus contour
kind rippled kind spiky whatever shape happens have, creates
imprint that. then, using imprint concert cells, creates
antibodies specific recognize invader body ever
invader inside again. Now, called adaptive immune system.
many ways creates memory prior infection antibodies can made
anytime invader comes back again, right? so, basis
call immunity. basis call enhanced ability combat certain
types infections. really wonderful, mean, can't even state
incredible really is, bodies capacity, right?
something called leukocytes. essentially white blood cells. red blood
cells white blood cells, derived type origin cell.
stem cell. hear stem cell, stem cell just means cell can become
many different types cells. sometimes hear stem cells terms
people getting injections stem cells potential therapeutic effects
potential stem cells. harbor certain stem cells within us well, can
become lots different cell types. one particular type stem cell,
hematopoietic stem cell, can give rise red blood cells white blood cells.


general, reside marrow, least adults. So, bone marrow,
ability make certain cells can go called
chemically, get called sites infection create antibodies,
maintain antibodies system, memory particular infection
infection comes back again, can kill off immediately. doesn't
pass multiple stages first, innate response, adaptive
response, taking time. Now, lot details adaptive immune
system, just want emphasize points might relevant. First all,
name antibodies created sometimes come form IgM IgG,
things sort. isn't full deep dive immunology class, Ig stands
immunoglobulin, okay? immunoglobulins part adaptive immune
response creating antibodies. hear IgM, IgM first adaptive
immune responses, tends come earlier. somebody immunopositive
IgM particular type viral bacterial invader, means fairly
recent infection. Later, one creates... adaptive immune system, say,
creates IgG, stable form specific antibody going
recognize given invader. IgG tends come little bit later. So, just recap,
something gets system eyes, hole skin,
cut, mouth, sexually transmitted diseases come mucus
membranes genitalia genitalia, sexually transmitted disease,
airborne disease, gets mucus, somehow gets bloodstream.
innate response, general response trying contain combat
infection invader. adaptive response one generates
antibodies. First, IgM response, immunoglobulin-M response,
immunoglobulin-G response, IgG response. So, keep three barriers
three defense systems infection tuned up? Well, leaving aside list things
mentioned generally enhances function, things like sleep
sunlight good nutrition, et cetera, sort generic things good health, one
key ways can keep mucus lining really good shape.
mean? Well, mucus lining needs turn quite often needs
correct chemistry trap bad stuff permeable good
stuff, nutrients need. now clear hundreds, not
thousands studies best way maintain healthy so-called
microbiome. microbiome little bacterial organisms good us


live along mucus pathways even eyes. Now, just really clear,
not just gut microbiome; actually microbiome eyes,
one specific mouth, nasal specific microbiome, one
along gut species microbiota live along digestive tract differ
mouth, throat, stomach, intestines, rectum. well-
established healthy microbiota live along length,
differ along length. also urethral microbiota, vaginal
microbiota promotes health environment well. one can
maintain healthy microbiota not favor growth harmful bacteria, allow
mucus lining become permeable bad stuff can come
environment?

00:28:00 Tool 1: Nasal Microbiome “Scrubbing” Bacteria & Viruses; Nasal Breathing

Well, far know, three main ways that. first two purely
structural mechanical. clear now work, done
Stanford, elsewhere well, nasal microbiome particularly good
scrubbing bacteria, preventing certain types infections. So, reminder
whenever possible, unless eating speaking, want nasal breathing, not
breathing mouth. nose much better filter viruses bacteria
mouth. mouth contains certain structural features, even organs cell
types can protect incoming infection, don't want mouth
breather variety reasons. terrific book called "Jaws: Hidden
Epidemic," written colleagues, Sandra Kahn Paul Ehrlich
Stanford, Stanford Medicine foreword Jared Diamond Robert
Sapolsky. really lot heavy hitters book talks increase
infection one gets breathing mouth, opposed nose. Now,
course, hard exercise, one breathes mouth, not necessarily
bad. one eating speaking, not necessarily bad all. guess depends
saying. joke. general, possible want
breathing nose. Many people trouble breathing nose
so-called deviated septums chronically collapsed sinuses. best way
dilate sinuses actually breathe nose. can take little bit
time, plasticity sinuses. so, nose breather, not mouth


breather, will combat infections constantly confronted with.
mention always bombarded different types bacteria, viruses,
parasites environment. goal course, reinforce immune
system, can keep things bay not get sick. actually paper
published Cell Reports, "Cell Press Journal," excellent journal showed
nasal microbiome, particular species microbiota good fighting
off infection. not direct link particular patterns nasal
breathing nasal microbiome yet, oxygenation environment
breathing nose, turns quite important overall enhancing
filter. don't just think nose something

00:30:33 Tools 2 & 3: (Not) Touching Eyes; Gut Microbiome & Fermented Foods

smell foods bring air. also active filter things invade you.
way try keep bad things avoid getting sick advice
mother, certainly mother gave me, not touch eyes
touching people touching surfaces. mentioned earlier, tend
subconsciously. reason avoid eyes primary entry
point lot bacteria viruses. constantly lubricating surface
eyes so-called lacrimal glands, tears things sort. ever
noticed wake morning, sleep eyes, know
kind crusty stuff corners eyes eyelashes, sleep,
crust actually dead bacteria successfully battled night. Okay,
is. not accumulation healthy tissue. accumulation
healthy mucus membranes tears things specifically
combating bacteria. So, know sounds little bit gross, is.
wiping away casualties battle fought night.
daytime, don't want introduce viruses things eyes much
possible. primary site entry. people wear goggles surgical units
things sort, try avoid getting things eyes. Very,
important. third way keep healthy line defense entire mucus
tract enhance proliferation good gut microbiota. best way enhance
quality gut microbiome mucus lining serves protective layer
along body ingest two four servings day fermented foods, low sugar


fermented foods. talked bunch times podcast,
data colleague, Justin Sonnenburg's lab Stanford Med. there, just
wiped eyes. Yep, got me. paper published journal "Cell,"
absolutely spectacular journal, really points fact people eat fermented
foods, two four servings per day, helps reduce activity certain cytokines. Now,
know are, right? Cells make cytokines call out, "help me, help me."
reduce amount cytokines, so-called inflammatom. Now doesn't render
cells vulnerable. reason saw reduction IL-6 IL-1,
cytokines people healthy gut microbiome,
fewer cells body infected outside infections therefore less
reason cells crying out, "help," thriving, not suffering. So,
don't wipe eyes, keep hands clean, everyone tells that, right? keep
hands clean, don't wipe eyes, nasal breather, not mouth breather,
unless speaking, exercising eating, keep healthy gut microbiome
eating two four servings day quality, low sugar, fermented foods, things like
sauerkraut, things like natto can access that. tried before, interesting.
sort acquired taste, kimchi, pickles, again, low sugar sources going
sources going effective this. now armed three ways
enhance function immune system combat infection is, like
think separate typical type information get get good sleep,
good nutrition, good social connection, et cetera. stuff still holds true,
three points think can really make

00:34:20 Interleukins Anti-Inflammatory

substantial difference terms bolstering immune system, immune system.
want mention, names going come several times
episode, interleukins like IL-6 IL-1 encourage inflammation,
"help me" signals call cells gobble invaders.
interleukins anti-inflammatory. one like highlight particular,
will come little bit interleukin-10. not IL, insert
number, not interleukins inflammatory, anti-inflammatory.

00:34:56 Sickness Behavior



important point keep mind go forward. Next, like talk
called sickness behavior. indeed category behavior call
sickness behavior informative things can avoid getting
sick. Now, notion sickness behavior goes back several decades more.
interesting way looking function immune system,
bridges us thing calling immune system T-
cells, B-cells, cytokines leukocytes, starts taking us realm
nervous system, course nervous system controls behavior.
sickness behavior suite responses tend undergo
feeling sick. going vary person person, general
categories things happen us wounded
sick dealing infection kind. examining sickness behavior
detail, can really informative routes can take health.
main thing sickness behavior tends involve slowing usual
levels activity. People start feel lethargic, feel like activities
previously relative ease difficult somewhat
overwhelming. thing start see people animals, way,
stop grooming, stop taking care themselves. Not necessarily stopped showering,
although oftentimes case, will stop hair, stop putting
makeup, depending whether not before, might stop. Animals
will stop licking grooming themselves. People will stop taking care cosmetic
appearance. Now not just don't care look sick,
overall suppression certain kinds activities
enhancement kinds activities. really important. Sickness behavior
actually motivated state. state designed accomplish certain things.
One features sickness behavior addition lethargic, loss
grooming, will loss appetite, right? Oftentimes people great appetite
normally just won't feel hungry all. several theories
be. One prominent idea literature discourage vomiting diarrhea,
course can infectious people. So, theory. don't know
ever tested directly, one idea. idea simply
harbor resources sake repair. want talk
told get extra sleep aren't feeling well rest. just like good two


three-year-old constantly asks, "why, why?" Good scientists, good people
interested health information always asking why. get
sleep? happens sleep get sleep sick?
shouldn't just push this? couple reasons
established literature. first seem something
useful slowing circulation ill. One idea data support
slow circulation, blood circulation, not running around
much running all, rather lying down, getting extra rest, maybe sleeping, maybe
even just remaining still, lymphatic system, carries lot immune-
related cells fluids, able ramp levels activity. So, interesting,
right? reducing circulation blood, increasing circulation lymphatic
system. probably familiar lymphatic system
combating infection, lymph nodes can get sore. got lymph nodes behind
ears, groin, armpits, around throat,

00:39:08 People Seek Care Sick, Others Want Alone

around near thyroid, throat, et cetera. So, reason. Now,
people, get sick, psychologically go vulnerable state
really, really want people, people take care them. probably
witnessed this, feel way yourself. 50% people response.
really want taken care of. Now, think adaptive
perspective, makes sense, right? member species ill
less will cry help one form another members species
take care them. course will especially apparent cases people
young enough incapacitated enough can't actually get resources
own. ever really sick, just getting going fridge
restroom can feel like monumental task. 50% people report describe
seeking help support sick. also imagine
non-adaptive response increases opportunity spread
infection caretaker. interesting consideration. Another 50% people
seem opposite response sick. So, somehow, regardless
prior getting ill, sickness behavior engaged neural
circuits brain, indeed neural circuits brain, create stay away


me. don't want bothered. want left alone. don't want taken care of,
right? not stubbornness. literally lack interest disinterest social
connection one sick. see animals too, animals will seek
members species. Others, like unfortunately now passed away
bulldog, Costello. sick always knew go around
back house just hide there. just take away
everybody else. not want taken care of. just natural response
him. don't think trying prevent getting whatever had.
ever somebody doesn't want taken care of, want taken care
of, realize people tend fall two bins naturally, animals tend fall
bins. Regardless species are, 50/50. again,
sickness behavior motivated state. designed slow circulation blood,
increase circulation lymph, killer cells body, reduce
probability infecting others reducing, thought, diarrhea vomit, also
breathing others, interacting others. cases will activate this, don't
want call regressed state, many people feel somewhat more...
adults, feel childlike ill want

00:42:00 Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines

taken care badly. might learned. might innate.
don't know, sickness behavior interesting couple reasons.
First all, mimics another state described neuroscience literature,
major depression. sick individuals, sick bacterial viral
infection, people major depression, shown robust
increases levels interleukin-6 tumor necrosis factor alpha.
idea now circulating depression involves inflammatory cytokines
active. know illness involves inflammatory cytokines active.
think it, similarity major depression sick
able point us direction interventions help us either prevent illness
move illness quickly. head direction, indeed
case, just want emphasize sickness behavior provides
bridge immune system nervous system. soon see
also healthy behavior, behavior allows us avoid infection, also points


clear bridge nervous system immune system. isn't just
brain body organs, immune system.
true, interacting time. going lead us place
going clear not surprising certain patterns thinking
certain behaviors

00:43:40 Reduced Appetites Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido

can elect take can help enhance immune system function vice versa.
two features sickness behavior definitely worth pointing out. One
theory, reduced appetite, particular appetite protein rich foods
sick, thought attempt, subconscious attempt, organism
reduce amount iron taking in. Now, typically amount iron intake
recommended less men, eight milligrams per day.
women, anywhere 18 27 milligrams per day, depending whether not
pregnant, lactating menstruating, et cetera, ranges can vary. But,
indeed, true iron levels blood go high, like 45 milligrams per day
can toxic system. theory prominent biology literature
health literature reduction appetite actually attempt
reduce iron intake specifically many bacteria forms infection seem
thrive levels iron blood high. don't want see anyone take
extreme suddenly iron deprivation diet order get well.
interesting theory remiss didn't mention, makes good sense.
Iron actually attached hemoglobin red blood cells bloodstream. Normally
can help us quite lot. also muscle, mention that. Iron can
sequestered muscle, iron serves lot important health promoting roles,
reducing appetite thereby reducing iron intake, reduce capacity
certain things, including infections travel certain compartments within body. So,
again, just theory, think many probably familiar not
appetite sick. thing typical people major
depression loss appetite, not always often loss appetite. So, again,
loss appetite sickness behavior, loss appetite major depression,
perhaps not surprisingly one major symptoms sickness behavior major
depression map less onto one another loss libido interest, not just


social interactions, sex reproduction. so, again, think
sickness behavior depression, very, similar. Okay, sickness
behavior major depression certain core features common. need
therefore ask sick influence way think
perceive environment impact appetite, whether not want
cared cared less? Again, people tend diverge two different bins
there,

00:46:45 Vagus-Nerve Stimulation: Fever, Photophobia, Sleepiness

believe not, pathway identified. infection
someplace body, head, sinus infection,
ear infection, also mention many mechanisms can
also consequence wound injury body. back injury slipped
disc guess called herniated disc way hear described.
that, can kind irritable, don't want certain things just want
left alone. Things harder. How? Why? Well, known pathway,
so-called vagus nerve connects body brain, signals particular
brain sites engage category motivational state call sickness behavior.
Many probably heard vagus, V-A-G-U-S, vagus. vagus nerve
extensive nerve pathway, 10th cranial nerve comes back
brainstem, heads body, branches extensively innervate connect
many organs, including lungs, heart, gut, et cetera.
organs able also send neural signals back brain. sometimes hear
vagus route calming down. Unfortunately, less
myth don't know got propagated. lots different pathways
vagus Usually vagal stimulation actually creates arousal alertness, although
multiple pathways, now many studies vagus
various contexts, including sickness behavior. clear vagus nerve
fast pathway infection body signaled brain,
particular location brain called hypothalamus, harbors lot different
types neurons. Neurons, instance, preoptic area increase body
temperature fever, right? one important things increase body
temperature, body's attempt kill off invader many viruses


many bacteria don't survive well elevated heat. function fever. fever
actually functional role. So, biology, like complicated words, call
anything increases body temperature creates fever, pyrogen. Many years
ago, undergraduate years, working pyrogens, injecting something called
lipopolysaccharide belly, gives fever. way
LPS causes inflammation response gut. gut doesn't know
happening. stomach cells don't know happening. just start secreting
IL-6, IL-1, cytokines, killer cells migrate gut.
sometimes get stomach ache don't feel well, flu, something
like it. neural signal, electrical signals get sent hypothalamus.
hypothalamus says, oh, don't know going there, signal
something's going on. just heat body. just start cooking whatever
there. course don't want fever go high can kill brain
cells. within particular range fever functional adaptive response, okay?
taking drugs try lower fever might make feel
comfortable, actually limiting response body creating order
try kill off invader. again, don't want fever go high. going
vary depending age. can look online tolerable ranges
fever. trying lower body temperature fever, unless
heading dangerous levels heating up, actually wrong way take
system indeed want kill off invader. Okay, vagus nerve
quick response. also sends input areas brain change perception
outside world. One obvious these, obvious tell you,
photophobia, right? love bright sunshine. love bright lights want alert.
different levels light sensitivity, people sick,
inflammation response body, feel like bright lights kind
aversive. get well-described kind classical photophobia, mediated
pathway goes eye area thalamus, called anterior
nucleus thalamus. work done Clifford Saper Harvard
Medical School. really beautiful work. outer lining
brain, meninges just sort outside brain brain starts
interface connective tissues. talk later.
can actually create photophobia headache one ill. So,
pathway: invader gets system 'cause wiped eyes got


mouth. didn't listen mother got eyes.
feeling sick. Something's going there. stomach ache
inflammation there, signal goes vagus nerve. heating
fever. got photophobia activated pathway
normally tolerable light triggering thalamic nucleus, anterior
thalamus, projecting meninges. got headache response
looking light. basically triggering overall pathway get go quiet,
dark place rest. last element like talk rest.
something gets triggered body brain, hypothalamus,
think know hypothalamic area is. supraoptic nucleus, think.
Supraoptic 'cause right so-called optic chiasm, want look
is, right roof mouth. nuclei
promote desire sleep even daytime, normally active
phase circadian cycle.

00:53:03 Humoral (Blood-Borne) Factors, & Choroid Change Brain State

Now, really interesting happening got multiple
pathways saying avoid light, reduce amount behavior, heat up,
things making sick. sickness behavior, going body
mind make right thing. Now also slow pathway
purely mediated blood, so-called humoral factors. Not 'cause funny,
humoral factors factors blood. infection many hours
days, amount IL-6 IL-1 tumor necrosis factor inflammatory
cytokines starting increase total amount circulation gets high
enough communicated brain. tends enter brain
particular type tissue really interesting called choroid, C-H-O-R-O-I-D. Choroid
really interesting. kind fluffy tissue sits ventricles. ventricles
spaces brain, spaces brain called cerebral
spinal fluid them. cerebral spinal fluid contains number important things,
choroid starts releasing responding cytokines, inflammatory
cytokines, brain actually starts experience sorts changes terms
inflammation neurons, memory tends get poor, cognition tends get
poor. transient things often. Eventually things will pass,


deep sickness really feeling lousy. can't read, can't watch
movie, can't anything. ever get sick just can't bothered
anything, probably fast response body
also slower response literally set tissues brain
sending inflammatory signals. now whole brain starting
cope,

00:55:04 Tools 4, 5: Reducing Sickness: Glymphatic Clearance, Pre-Sleep Serotonin,
5HTP

trying cope infection. got slow pathway fast pathway.
sounds really terrible. So, now, like talk can reduce
probability getting sick. actually things one can start
get sick sick, accelerate healing process flipping
equation. now talking body activates certain areas
brain create sickness behavior much like depression. probably
familiar anytime cold flu something really lousy
injury. Now, flip equation ask can nervous system
order enhance function immune system order able heal
recover illness injury quickly. say unfortunate
circumstance waking one day coming home, got tickle

couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard

waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline

ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release

somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,
region hind brain back brain kind near neck
medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal
prominent "Nature" featuring upfront, think really mark
beginning new path medicine. just underscore point little bit further,
National Institutes Health, course cancer institute, eye institute,
deal trying combat cancer cure blindness forth. now
called NCCIH, complimentary health. so, good tax
dollars put kinds explorations talking undoubtedly
going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times
hope learning new emerging science hearing
protocols either zero cost low cost, certainly respiration
case use heat cold, maybe even electroacupuncture
access that, can really see starting evolve field health
medicine science ancient practices, really starting converge

00:11:20 Immune System Basics: Skin/Mucous, Innate & Adaptive Immune System

like shift conversation to. first topic attack
question immune system work? think many
heard antibodies killer cells various organs body involved
immune system, like bone marrow, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes.
like just take moment sort brief immune system 101; really simple,
cover basic elements immune system everyone listening watching
can get clear sense immune system functions basic parts
are. you, might basic. might little bit background


already know. think you, information will new. promise
you, don't need biology medicine background order understand this.
actually really simple truly elegant design. three main layers
defense health. three things constantly work protect
invasion illness bacteria, viruses, parasites.
first three physical barrier call skin. might seem kind
obvious, everything contained compartment boundaried
skin. skin important aspect immune system.
ever cut, essentially breach boundary immune
system, notice number things happen. might get
swelling around cut. might get scab, likely get scab time.
got dirty, bacteria got there, might see accumulation
white blood cells, called puss. know kind gross, is.
might take yellow tint accumulation dead cells there.
basically skin primary barrier keep things outside
harm getting inside. Now, still category one, body
external surface, openings surface, right? not just round
body shaped completely covered skin. openings,
openings? Well, start top work way down. primary site potential
infection eyes. ears, nostrils,
mouth. Okay, going primary sites things can get
system. need put things system; need drink eat,
need get light system. openings, bad things,
meaning things can harm you, can get systems. course,
along back throat, way stomach digestive
system, intestines rectum, tube,
basically series tubes. said podcast, one
tube extract nutrients outside environment. along tube,
including nose mouth, lined mucus. mucus might seem
kind gross you, learn mucus, realize
mucus really, really cool mucus essentially acts filter, trap
bacteria viruses. certain ways scrubbing killing bacteria
viruses. Now, mucus constantly turned over, talk later,
chemistry mucus really important order make sure certain things don't


make system, things allowed move system
can extract nutrients them. reason talking first category
barrier immune system detail like envision human,
course, human clear entity everything else.
bring right things keep wrong things kill them. Now,
inevitably, bacteria, viruses, parasitic infections going make way
body, whether not killed off whether not take cause us
harm going determined layers two three. So, layers two three
so-called innate immune system adaptive immune system. innate
immune system call second layer defense. fast.
whether not bacteria, virus, parasite, happens something
enter body, maybe swallowed it, maybe got eyes, maybe
shook somebody's hand carrying particular kind illness, wiped
eyes. talked podcast before, soon meet another
person, usually within 30 seconds, believe not, people wipe person's
chemicals somewhere face body's surface.
demonstrated again. want learn that,
episode chemical signaling, can learn it. know sounds
weird might say, "I don't that," indeed do, time
everybody does. Okay, so, innate immune system rapid response
something enters system body doesn't recognize it. not food, not
clean air, something either bacteria, virus parasite. innate immune
system involves release

00:17:08 Killer Cells, Complement Proteins (“Eat Me!” Signals), Cytokines (“Help Me!”
Signals)

particular cells waiting dormant, ready attack whatever invader is.
cell types heard before. typical one so-called
white blood cells. So, white blood cells will actively go site invasion will
start encapsulate try surround given invader. names
different cell types things like neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells just
many types immune cells. kind like ambulance system,
rather go try heal something like paramedic would, go


try surround kill whatever invader is. work concert two
assistants, assistants called compliment proteins. Compliment
proteins exist blood, travel sites
invasion mark certain things engulfed eaten. sort put
"eat me" tag it. basically put chemical tag onto invaders allows
white blood cells, neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells say, "Ah, need
basically kill thing, wrap body bag send off. Kill thing,
wrap body bag send off." using analogy body bag,
sense right one rather cells come kill things, way
actually engulf invading bacteria, virus parasite. actually
surround it. see puss see infection maybe cut skin
something like that, even ingrown hair gets bacteria it, puss
white part, know kind gross talk about, white blood
cells, oftentimes dead cells, dead invader sitting there. trying
create isolated compartment 'cause wants keep part body. Okay,
got innate immune system, compliment comes blood
helps tagging certain things "eat me" signal. cells
either damaged injury parasite, suffering
bacteria virus itself, cells body will also release alarm
signal, not "eat me" signal, "help me" signal. "help me"
signals come form call cytokines. cytokines things like
interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha. may heard
things curious learning health space,
online health space, especially last years, inflammation buzz word
now. Everyone's talking inflammation, inflammation, inflammation.
mean say inflammation? Well, inflammation physical response, also
chemical response. many times markers inflammation measured
people animal models research done, things like interleukin-1,
interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha. go blood, sign
somewhere cell saying "help me, help me." secreting
things calls neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells, white blood
cells, okay? might help remember this, just telling people
interleukin means communicate, right? interleukin shouting "help me,"
compliment proteins coming saying, "eat this" tagging invader


"eat me" signal. killer cells white blood cells
job trying kill off thing. innate immune system. So, skin
mucus lining plus innate immune system beautiful two-layered

00:21:06 Adaptive Immune System: Antibodies

set defenses various kinds invaders infections.
third type, adaptive immune system. notice leading
now, haven't said word antibody all, job not
skin mucus microbiome innate immune system produce antibodies
can recognize specific invaders, rather job adaptive immune
system create antibodies bacteria, viruses, even parasites even
physical intruders system. So, adaptive immune system incredible
ability show site invasion infection inflammation. called
various cues, including cytokines talked earlier.
actually attaches creates sort imprint shape whatever invader
happens there. particular invading bacteria virus contour
kind rippled kind spiky whatever shape happens have, creates
imprint that. then, using imprint concert cells, creates
antibodies specific recognize invader body ever
invader inside again. Now, called adaptive immune system.
many ways creates memory prior infection antibodies can made
anytime invader comes back again, right? so, basis
call immunity. basis call enhanced ability combat certain
types infections. really wonderful, mean, can't even state
incredible really is, bodies capacity, right?
something called leukocytes. essentially white blood cells. red blood
cells white blood cells, derived type origin cell.
stem cell. hear stem cell, stem cell just means cell can become
many different types cells. sometimes hear stem cells terms
people getting injections stem cells potential therapeutic effects
potential stem cells. harbor certain stem cells within us well, can
become lots different cell types. one particular type stem cell,
hematopoietic stem cell, can give rise red blood cells white blood cells.


general, reside marrow, least adults. So, bone marrow,
ability make certain cells can go called
chemically, get called sites infection create antibodies,
maintain antibodies system, memory particular infection
infection comes back again, can kill off immediately. doesn't
pass multiple stages first, innate response, adaptive
response, taking time. Now, lot details adaptive immune
system, just want emphasize points might relevant. First all,
name antibodies created sometimes come form IgM IgG,
things sort. isn't full deep dive immunology class, Ig stands
immunoglobulin, okay? immunoglobulins part adaptive immune
response creating antibodies. hear IgM, IgM first adaptive
immune responses, tends come earlier. somebody immunopositive
IgM particular type viral bacterial invader, means fairly
recent infection. Later, one creates... adaptive immune system, say,
creates IgG, stable form specific antibody going
recognize given invader. IgG tends come little bit later. So, just recap,
something gets system eyes, hole skin,
cut, mouth, sexually transmitted diseases come mucus
membranes genitalia genitalia, sexually transmitted disease,
airborne disease, gets mucus, somehow gets bloodstream.
innate response, general response trying contain combat
infection invader. adaptive response one generates
antibodies. First, IgM response, immunoglobulin-M response,
immunoglobulin-G response, IgG response. So, keep three barriers
three defense systems infection tuned up? Well, leaving aside list things
mentioned generally enhances function, things like sleep
sunlight good nutrition, et cetera, sort generic things good health, one
key ways can keep mucus lining really good shape.
mean? Well, mucus lining needs turn quite often needs
correct chemistry trap bad stuff permeable good
stuff, nutrients need. now clear hundreds, not
thousands studies best way maintain healthy so-called
microbiome. microbiome little bacterial organisms good us


live along mucus pathways even eyes. Now, just really clear,
not just gut microbiome; actually microbiome eyes,
one specific mouth, nasal specific microbiome, one
along gut species microbiota live along digestive tract differ
mouth, throat, stomach, intestines, rectum. well-
established healthy microbiota live along length,
differ along length. also urethral microbiota, vaginal
microbiota promotes health environment well. one can
maintain healthy microbiota not favor growth harmful bacteria, allow
mucus lining become permeable bad stuff can come
environment?

00:28:00 Tool 1: Nasal Microbiome “Scrubbing” Bacteria & Viruses; Nasal Breathing

Well, far know, three main ways that. first two purely
structural mechanical. clear now work, done
Stanford, elsewhere well, nasal microbiome particularly good
scrubbing bacteria, preventing certain types infections. So, reminder
whenever possible, unless eating speaking, want nasal breathing, not
breathing mouth. nose much better filter viruses bacteria
mouth. mouth contains certain structural features, even organs cell
types can protect incoming infection, don't want mouth
breather variety reasons. terrific book called "Jaws: Hidden
Epidemic," written colleagues, Sandra Kahn Paul Ehrlich
Stanford, Stanford Medicine foreword Jared Diamond Robert
Sapolsky. really lot heavy hitters book talks increase
infection one gets breathing mouth, opposed nose. Now,
course, hard exercise, one breathes mouth, not necessarily
bad. one eating speaking, not necessarily bad all. guess depends
saying. joke. general, possible want
breathing nose. Many people trouble breathing nose
so-called deviated septums chronically collapsed sinuses. best way
dilate sinuses actually breathe nose. can take little bit
time, plasticity sinuses. so, nose breather, not mouth


breather, will combat infections constantly confronted with.
mention always bombarded different types bacteria, viruses,
parasites environment. goal course, reinforce immune
system, can keep things bay not get sick. actually paper
published Cell Reports, "Cell Press Journal," excellent journal showed
nasal microbiome, particular species microbiota good fighting
off infection. not direct link particular patterns nasal
breathing nasal microbiome yet, oxygenation environment
breathing nose, turns quite important overall enhancing
filter. don't just think nose something

00:30:33 Tools 2 & 3: (Not) Touching Eyes; Gut Microbiome & Fermented Foods

smell foods bring air. also active filter things invade you.
way try keep bad things avoid getting sick advice
mother, certainly mother gave me, not touch eyes
touching people touching surfaces. mentioned earlier, tend
subconsciously. reason avoid eyes primary entry
point lot bacteria viruses. constantly lubricating surface
eyes so-called lacrimal glands, tears things sort. ever
noticed wake morning, sleep eyes, know
kind crusty stuff corners eyes eyelashes, sleep,
crust actually dead bacteria successfully battled night. Okay,
is. not accumulation healthy tissue. accumulation
healthy mucus membranes tears things specifically
combating bacteria. So, know sounds little bit gross, is.
wiping away casualties battle fought night.
daytime, don't want introduce viruses things eyes much
possible. primary site entry. people wear goggles surgical units
things sort, try avoid getting things eyes. Very,
important. third way keep healthy line defense entire mucus
tract enhance proliferation good gut microbiota. best way enhance
quality gut microbiome mucus lining serves protective layer
along body ingest two four servings day fermented foods, low sugar


fermented foods. talked bunch times podcast,
data colleague, Justin Sonnenburg's lab Stanford Med. there, just
wiped eyes. Yep, got me. paper published journal "Cell,"
absolutely spectacular journal, really points fact people eat fermented
foods, two four servings per day, helps reduce activity certain cytokines. Now,
know are, right? Cells make cytokines call out, "help me, help me."
reduce amount cytokines, so-called inflammatom. Now doesn't render
cells vulnerable. reason saw reduction IL-6 IL-1,
cytokines people healthy gut microbiome,
fewer cells body infected outside infections therefore less
reason cells crying out, "help," thriving, not suffering. So,
don't wipe eyes, keep hands clean, everyone tells that, right? keep
hands clean, don't wipe eyes, nasal breather, not mouth breather,
unless speaking, exercising eating, keep healthy gut microbiome
eating two four servings day quality, low sugar, fermented foods, things like
sauerkraut, things like natto can access that. tried before, interesting.
sort acquired taste, kimchi, pickles, again, low sugar sources going
sources going effective this. now armed three ways
enhance function immune system combat infection is, like
think separate typical type information get get good sleep,
good nutrition, good social connection, et cetera. stuff still holds true,
three points think can really make

00:34:20 Interleukins Anti-Inflammatory

substantial difference terms bolstering immune system, immune system.
want mention, names going come several times
episode, interleukins like IL-6 IL-1 encourage inflammation,
"help me" signals call cells gobble invaders.
interleukins anti-inflammatory. one like highlight particular,
will come little bit interleukin-10. not IL, insert
number, not interleukins inflammatory, anti-inflammatory.

00:34:56 Sickness Behavior



important point keep mind go forward. Next, like talk
called sickness behavior. indeed category behavior call
sickness behavior informative things can avoid getting
sick. Now, notion sickness behavior goes back several decades more.
interesting way looking function immune system,
bridges us thing calling immune system T-
cells, B-cells, cytokines leukocytes, starts taking us realm
nervous system, course nervous system controls behavior.
sickness behavior suite responses tend undergo
feeling sick. going vary person person, general
categories things happen us wounded
sick dealing infection kind. examining sickness behavior
detail, can really informative routes can take health.
main thing sickness behavior tends involve slowing usual
levels activity. People start feel lethargic, feel like activities
previously relative ease difficult somewhat
overwhelming. thing start see people animals, way,
stop grooming, stop taking care themselves. Not necessarily stopped showering,
although oftentimes case, will stop hair, stop putting
makeup, depending whether not before, might stop. Animals
will stop licking grooming themselves. People will stop taking care cosmetic
appearance. Now not just don't care look sick,
overall suppression certain kinds activities
enhancement kinds activities. really important. Sickness behavior
actually motivated state. state designed accomplish certain things.
One features sickness behavior addition lethargic, loss
grooming, will loss appetite, right? Oftentimes people great appetite
normally just won't feel hungry all. several theories
be. One prominent idea literature discourage vomiting diarrhea,
course can infectious people. So, theory. don't know
ever tested directly, one idea. idea simply
harbor resources sake repair. want talk
told get extra sleep aren't feeling well rest. just like good two


three-year-old constantly asks, "why, why?" Good scientists, good people
interested health information always asking why. get
sleep? happens sleep get sleep sick?
shouldn't just push this? couple reasons
established literature. first seem something
useful slowing circulation ill. One idea data support
slow circulation, blood circulation, not running around
much running all, rather lying down, getting extra rest, maybe sleeping, maybe
even just remaining still, lymphatic system, carries lot immune-
related cells fluids, able ramp levels activity. So, interesting,
right? reducing circulation blood, increasing circulation lymphatic
system. probably familiar lymphatic system
combating infection, lymph nodes can get sore. got lymph nodes behind
ears, groin, armpits, around throat,

00:39:08 People Seek Care Sick, Others Want Alone

around near thyroid, throat, et cetera. So, reason. Now,
people, get sick, psychologically go vulnerable state
really, really want people, people take care them. probably
witnessed this, feel way yourself. 50% people response.
really want taken care of. Now, think adaptive
perspective, makes sense, right? member species ill
less will cry help one form another members species
take care them. course will especially apparent cases people
young enough incapacitated enough can't actually get resources
own. ever really sick, just getting going fridge
restroom can feel like monumental task. 50% people report describe
seeking help support sick. also imagine
non-adaptive response increases opportunity spread
infection caretaker. interesting consideration. Another 50% people
seem opposite response sick. So, somehow, regardless
prior getting ill, sickness behavior engaged neural
circuits brain, indeed neural circuits brain, create stay away


me. don't want bothered. want left alone. don't want taken care of,
right? not stubbornness. literally lack interest disinterest social
connection one sick. see animals too, animals will seek
members species. Others, like unfortunately now passed away
bulldog, Costello. sick always knew go around
back house just hide there. just take away
everybody else. not want taken care of. just natural response
him. don't think trying prevent getting whatever had.
ever somebody doesn't want taken care of, want taken care
of, realize people tend fall two bins naturally, animals tend fall
bins. Regardless species are, 50/50. again,
sickness behavior motivated state. designed slow circulation blood,
increase circulation lymph, killer cells body, reduce
probability infecting others reducing, thought, diarrhea vomit, also
breathing others, interacting others. cases will activate this, don't
want call regressed state, many people feel somewhat more...
adults, feel childlike ill want

00:42:00 Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines

taken care badly. might learned. might innate.
don't know, sickness behavior interesting couple reasons.
First all, mimics another state described neuroscience literature,
major depression. sick individuals, sick bacterial viral
infection, people major depression, shown robust
increases levels interleukin-6 tumor necrosis factor alpha.
idea now circulating depression involves inflammatory cytokines
active. know illness involves inflammatory cytokines active.
think it, similarity major depression sick
able point us direction interventions help us either prevent illness
move illness quickly. head direction, indeed
case, just want emphasize sickness behavior provides
bridge immune system nervous system. soon see
also healthy behavior, behavior allows us avoid infection, also points


clear bridge nervous system immune system. isn't just
brain body organs, immune system.
true, interacting time. going lead us place
going clear not surprising certain patterns thinking
certain behaviors

00:43:40 Reduced Appetites Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido

can elect take can help enhance immune system function vice versa.
two features sickness behavior definitely worth pointing out. One
theory, reduced appetite, particular appetite protein rich foods
sick, thought attempt, subconscious attempt, organism
reduce amount iron taking in. Now, typically amount iron intake
recommended less men, eight milligrams per day.
women, anywhere 18 27 milligrams per day, depending whether not
pregnant, lactating menstruating, et cetera, ranges can vary. But,
indeed, true iron levels blood go high, like 45 milligrams per day
can toxic system. theory prominent biology literature
health literature reduction appetite actually attempt
reduce iron intake specifically many bacteria forms infection seem
thrive levels iron blood high. don't want see anyone take
extreme suddenly iron deprivation diet order get well.
interesting theory remiss didn't mention, makes good sense.
Iron actually attached hemoglobin red blood cells bloodstream. Normally
can help us quite lot. also muscle, mention that. Iron can
sequestered muscle, iron serves lot important health promoting roles,
reducing appetite thereby reducing iron intake, reduce capacity
certain things, including infections travel certain compartments within body. So,
again, just theory, think many probably familiar not
appetite sick. thing typical people major
depression loss appetite, not always often loss appetite. So, again,
loss appetite sickness behavior, loss appetite major depression,
perhaps not surprisingly one major symptoms sickness behavior major
depression map less onto one another loss libido interest, not just


social interactions, sex reproduction. so, again, think
sickness behavior depression, very, similar. Okay, sickness
behavior major depression certain core features common. need
therefore ask sick influence way think
perceive environment impact appetite, whether not want
cared cared less? Again, people tend diverge two different bins
there,

00:46:45 Vagus-Nerve Stimulation: Fever, Photophobia, Sleepiness

believe not, pathway identified. infection
someplace body, head, sinus infection,
ear infection, also mention many mechanisms can
also consequence wound injury body. back injury slipped
disc guess called herniated disc way hear described.
that, can kind irritable, don't want certain things just want
left alone. Things harder. How? Why? Well, known pathway,
so-called vagus nerve connects body brain, signals particular
brain sites engage category motivational state call sickness behavior.
Many probably heard vagus, V-A-G-U-S, vagus. vagus nerve
extensive nerve pathway, 10th cranial nerve comes back
brainstem, heads body, branches extensively innervate connect
many organs, including lungs, heart, gut, et cetera.
organs able also send neural signals back brain. sometimes hear
vagus route calming down. Unfortunately, less
myth don't know got propagated. lots different pathways
vagus Usually vagal stimulation actually creates arousal alertness, although
multiple pathways, now many studies vagus
various contexts, including sickness behavior. clear vagus nerve
fast pathway infection body signaled brain,
particular location brain called hypothalamus, harbors lot different
types neurons. Neurons, instance, preoptic area increase body
temperature fever, right? one important things increase body
temperature, body's attempt kill off invader many viruses


many bacteria don't survive well elevated heat. function fever. fever
actually functional role. So, biology, like complicated words, call
anything increases body temperature creates fever, pyrogen. Many years
ago, undergraduate years, working pyrogens, injecting something called
lipopolysaccharide belly, gives fever. way
LPS causes inflammation response gut. gut doesn't know
happening. stomach cells don't know happening. just start secreting
IL-6, IL-1, cytokines, killer cells migrate gut.
sometimes get stomach ache don't feel well, flu, something
like it. neural signal, electrical signals get sent hypothalamus.
hypothalamus says, oh, don't know going there, signal
something's going on. just heat body. just start cooking whatever
there. course don't want fever go high can kill brain
cells. within particular range fever functional adaptive response, okay?
taking drugs try lower fever might make feel
comfortable, actually limiting response body creating order
try kill off invader. again, don't want fever go high. going
vary depending age. can look online tolerable ranges
fever. trying lower body temperature fever, unless
heading dangerous levels heating up, actually wrong way take
system indeed want kill off invader. Okay, vagus nerve
quick response. also sends input areas brain change perception
outside world. One obvious these, obvious tell you,
photophobia, right? love bright sunshine. love bright lights want alert.
different levels light sensitivity, people sick,
inflammation response body, feel like bright lights kind
aversive. get well-described kind classical photophobia, mediated
pathway goes eye area thalamus, called anterior
nucleus thalamus. work done Clifford Saper Harvard
Medical School. really beautiful work. outer lining
brain, meninges just sort outside brain brain starts
interface connective tissues. talk later.
can actually create photophobia headache one ill. So,
pathway: invader gets system 'cause wiped eyes got


mouth. didn't listen mother got eyes.
feeling sick. Something's going there. stomach ache
inflammation there, signal goes vagus nerve. heating
fever. got photophobia activated pathway
normally tolerable light triggering thalamic nucleus, anterior
thalamus, projecting meninges. got headache response
looking light. basically triggering overall pathway get go quiet,
dark place rest. last element like talk rest.
something gets triggered body brain, hypothalamus,
think know hypothalamic area is. supraoptic nucleus, think.
Supraoptic 'cause right so-called optic chiasm, want look
is, right roof mouth. nuclei
promote desire sleep even daytime, normally active
phase circadian cycle.

00:53:03 Humoral (Blood-Borne) Factors, & Choroid Change Brain State

Now, really interesting happening got multiple
pathways saying avoid light, reduce amount behavior, heat up,
things making sick. sickness behavior, going body
mind make right thing. Now also slow pathway
purely mediated blood, so-called humoral factors. Not 'cause funny,
humoral factors factors blood. infection many hours
days, amount IL-6 IL-1 tumor necrosis factor inflammatory
cytokines starting increase total amount circulation gets high
enough communicated brain. tends enter brain
particular type tissue really interesting called choroid, C-H-O-R-O-I-D. Choroid
really interesting. kind fluffy tissue sits ventricles. ventricles
spaces brain, spaces brain called cerebral
spinal fluid them. cerebral spinal fluid contains number important things,
choroid starts releasing responding cytokines, inflammatory
cytokines, brain actually starts experience sorts changes terms
inflammation neurons, memory tends get poor, cognition tends get
poor. transient things often. Eventually things will pass,


deep sickness really feeling lousy. can't read, can't watch
movie, can't anything. ever get sick just can't bothered
anything, probably fast response body
also slower response literally set tissues brain
sending inflammatory signals. now whole brain starting
cope,

00:55:04 Tools 4, 5: Reducing Sickness: Glymphatic Clearance, Pre-Sleep Serotonin,
5HTP

trying cope infection. got slow pathway fast pathway.
sounds really terrible. So, now, like talk can reduce
probability getting sick. actually things one can start
get sick sick, accelerate healing process flipping
equation. now talking body activates certain areas
brain create sickness behavior much like depression. probably
familiar anytime cold flu something really lousy

couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard

waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline

ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release

really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,
region hind brain back brain kind near neck
medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal
prominent "Nature" featuring upfront, think really mark
beginning new path medicine. just underscore point little bit further,
National Institutes Health, course cancer institute, eye institute,
deal trying combat cancer cure blindness forth. now
called NCCIH, complimentary health. so, good tax
dollars put kinds explorations talking undoubtedly
going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times
hope learning new emerging science hearing
protocols either zero cost low cost, certainly respiration
case use heat cold, maybe even electroacupuncture
access that, can really see starting evolve field health
medicine science ancient practices, really starting converge

already know. think you, information will new. promise
you, don't need biology medicine background order understand this.
actually really simple truly elegant design. three main layers
defense health. three things constantly work protect
invasion illness bacteria, viruses, parasites.
first three physical barrier call skin. might seem kind
obvious, everything contained compartment boundaried
skin. skin important aspect immune system.
ever cut, essentially breach boundary immune
system, notice number things happen. might get
swelling around cut. might get scab, likely get scab time.
got dirty, bacteria got there, might see accumulation
white blood cells, called puss. know kind gross, is.
might take yellow tint accumulation dead cells there.
basically skin primary barrier keep things outside
harm getting inside. Now, still category one, body
external surface, openings surface, right? not just round
body shaped completely covered skin. openings,
openings? Well, start top work way down. primary site potential
infection eyes. ears, nostrils,
mouth. Okay, going primary sites things can get
system. need put things system; need drink eat,
need get light system. openings, bad things,
meaning things can harm you, can get systems. course,
along back throat, way stomach digestive
system, intestines rectum, tube,
basically series tubes. said podcast, one
tube extract nutrients outside environment. along tube,
including nose mouth, lined mucus. mucus might seem
kind gross you, learn mucus, realize
mucus really, really cool mucus essentially acts filter, trap
bacteria viruses. certain ways scrubbing killing bacteria
viruses. Now, mucus constantly turned over, talk later,
chemistry mucus really important order make sure certain things don't


make system, things allowed move system
can extract nutrients them. reason talking first category
barrier immune system detail like envision human,
course, human clear entity everything else.
bring right things keep wrong things kill them. Now,
inevitably, bacteria, viruses, parasitic infections going make way
body, whether not killed off whether not take cause us
harm going determined layers two three. So, layers two three
so-called innate immune system adaptive immune system. innate
immune system call second layer defense. fast.
whether not bacteria, virus, parasite, happens something
enter body, maybe swallowed it, maybe got eyes, maybe
shook somebody's hand carrying particular kind illness, wiped
eyes. talked podcast before, soon meet another
person, usually within 30 seconds, believe not, people wipe person's
chemicals somewhere face body's surface.
demonstrated again. want learn that,
episode chemical signaling, can learn it. know sounds
weird might say, "I don't that," indeed do, time
everybody does. Okay, so, innate immune system rapid response
something enters system body doesn't recognize it. not food, not
clean air, something either bacteria, virus parasite. innate immune
system involves release

00:17:08 Killer Cells, Complement Proteins (“Eat Me!” Signals), Cytokines (“Help Me!”
Signals)

particular cells waiting dormant, ready attack whatever invader is.
cell types heard before. typical one so-called
white blood cells. So, white blood cells will actively go site invasion will
start encapsulate try surround given invader. names
different cell types things like neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells just
many types immune cells. kind like ambulance system,
rather go try heal something like paramedic would, go


try surround kill whatever invader is. work concert two
assistants, assistants called compliment proteins. Compliment
proteins exist blood, travel sites
invasion mark certain things engulfed eaten. sort put
"eat me" tag it. basically put chemical tag onto invaders allows
white blood cells, neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells say, "Ah, need
basically kill thing, wrap body bag send off. Kill thing,
wrap body bag send off." using analogy body bag,
sense right one rather cells come kill things, way
actually engulf invading bacteria, virus parasite. actually
surround it. see puss see infection maybe cut skin
something like that, even ingrown hair gets bacteria it, puss
white part, know kind gross talk about, white blood
cells, oftentimes dead cells, dead invader sitting there. trying
create isolated compartment 'cause wants keep part body. Okay,
got innate immune system, compliment comes blood
helps tagging certain things "eat me" signal. cells
either damaged injury parasite, suffering
bacteria virus itself, cells body will also release alarm
signal, not "eat me" signal, "help me" signal. "help me"
signals come form call cytokines. cytokines things like
interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha. may heard
things curious learning health space,
online health space, especially last years, inflammation buzz word
now. Everyone's talking inflammation, inflammation, inflammation.
mean say inflammation? Well, inflammation physical response, also
chemical response. many times markers inflammation measured
people animal models research done, things like interleukin-1,
interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha. go blood, sign
somewhere cell saying "help me, help me." secreting
things calls neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells, white blood
cells, okay? might help remember this, just telling people
interleukin means communicate, right? interleukin shouting "help me,"
compliment proteins coming saying, "eat this" tagging invader


"eat me" signal. killer cells white blood cells
job trying kill off thing. innate immune system. So, skin
mucus lining plus innate immune system beautiful two-layered

00:21:06 Adaptive Immune System: Antibodies

set defenses various kinds invaders infections.
third type, adaptive immune system. notice leading
now, haven't said word antibody all, job not
skin mucus microbiome innate immune system produce antibodies
can recognize specific invaders, rather job adaptive immune
system create antibodies bacteria, viruses, even parasites even
physical intruders system. So, adaptive immune system incredible
ability show site invasion infection inflammation. called
various cues, including cytokines talked earlier.
actually attaches creates sort imprint shape whatever invader
happens there. particular invading bacteria virus contour
kind rippled kind spiky whatever shape happens have, creates
imprint that. then, using imprint concert cells, creates
antibodies specific recognize invader body ever
invader inside again. Now, called adaptive immune system.
many ways creates memory prior infection antibodies can made
anytime invader comes back again, right? so, basis
call immunity. basis call enhanced ability combat certain
types infections. really wonderful, mean, can't even state
incredible really is, bodies capacity, right?
something called leukocytes. essentially white blood cells. red blood
cells white blood cells, derived type origin cell.
stem cell. hear stem cell, stem cell just means cell can become
many different types cells. sometimes hear stem cells terms
people getting injections stem cells potential therapeutic effects
potential stem cells. harbor certain stem cells within us well, can
become lots different cell types. one particular type stem cell,
hematopoietic stem cell, can give rise red blood cells white blood cells.


general, reside marrow, least adults. So, bone marrow,
ability make certain cells can go called
chemically, get called sites infection create antibodies,
maintain antibodies system, memory particular infection
infection comes back again, can kill off immediately. doesn't
pass multiple stages first, innate response, adaptive
response, taking time. Now, lot details adaptive immune
system, just want emphasize points might relevant. First all,
name antibodies created sometimes come form IgM IgG,
things sort. isn't full deep dive immunology class, Ig stands
immunoglobulin, okay? immunoglobulins part adaptive immune
response creating antibodies. hear IgM, IgM first adaptive
immune responses, tends come earlier. somebody immunopositive
IgM particular type viral bacterial invader, means fairly
recent infection. Later, one creates... adaptive immune system, say,
creates IgG, stable form specific antibody going
recognize given invader. IgG tends come little bit later. So, just recap,
something gets system eyes, hole skin,
cut, mouth, sexually transmitted diseases come mucus
membranes genitalia genitalia, sexually transmitted disease,
airborne disease, gets mucus, somehow gets bloodstream.
innate response, general response trying contain combat
infection invader. adaptive response one generates
antibodies. First, IgM response, immunoglobulin-M response,
immunoglobulin-G response, IgG response. So, keep three barriers
three defense systems infection tuned up? Well, leaving aside list things
mentioned generally enhances function, things like sleep
sunlight good nutrition, et cetera, sort generic things good health, one
key ways can keep mucus lining really good shape.
mean? Well, mucus lining needs turn quite often needs
correct chemistry trap bad stuff permeable good
stuff, nutrients need. now clear hundreds, not
thousands studies best way maintain healthy so-called
microbiome. microbiome little bacterial organisms good us


live along mucus pathways even eyes. Now, just really clear,
not just gut microbiome; actually microbiome eyes,
one specific mouth, nasal specific microbiome, one
along gut species microbiota live along digestive tract differ
mouth, throat, stomach, intestines, rectum. well-
established healthy microbiota live along length,
differ along length. also urethral microbiota, vaginal
microbiota promotes health environment well. one can
maintain healthy microbiota not favor growth harmful bacteria, allow
mucus lining become permeable bad stuff can come
environment?

00:28:00 Tool 1: Nasal Microbiome “Scrubbing” Bacteria & Viruses; Nasal Breathing

Well, far know, three main ways that. first two purely
structural mechanical. clear now work, done
Stanford, elsewhere well, nasal microbiome particularly good
scrubbing bacteria, preventing certain types infections. So, reminder
whenever possible, unless eating speaking, want nasal breathing, not
breathing mouth. nose much better filter viruses bacteria
mouth. mouth contains certain structural features, even organs cell
types can protect incoming infection, don't want mouth
breather variety reasons. terrific book called "Jaws: Hidden
Epidemic," written colleagues, Sandra Kahn Paul Ehrlich
Stanford, Stanford Medicine foreword Jared Diamond Robert
Sapolsky. really lot heavy hitters book talks increase
infection one gets breathing mouth, opposed nose. Now,
course, hard exercise, one breathes mouth, not necessarily
bad. one eating speaking, not necessarily bad all. guess depends
saying. joke. general, possible want
breathing nose. Many people trouble breathing nose
so-called deviated septums chronically collapsed sinuses. best way
dilate sinuses actually breathe nose. can take little bit
time, plasticity sinuses. so, nose breather, not mouth


breather, will combat infections constantly confronted with.
mention always bombarded different types bacteria, viruses,
parasites environment. goal course, reinforce immune
system, can keep things bay not get sick. actually paper
published Cell Reports, "Cell Press Journal," excellent journal showed
nasal microbiome, particular species microbiota good fighting
off infection. not direct link particular patterns nasal
breathing nasal microbiome yet, oxygenation environment
breathing nose, turns quite important overall enhancing
filter. don't just think nose something

00:30:33 Tools 2 & 3: (Not) Touching Eyes; Gut Microbiome & Fermented Foods

smell foods bring air. also active filter things invade you.
way try keep bad things avoid getting sick advice
mother, certainly mother gave me, not touch eyes
touching people touching surfaces. mentioned earlier, tend
subconsciously. reason avoid eyes primary entry
point lot bacteria viruses. constantly lubricating surface
eyes so-called lacrimal glands, tears things sort. ever
noticed wake morning, sleep eyes, know
kind crusty stuff corners eyes eyelashes, sleep,
crust actually dead bacteria successfully battled night. Okay,
is. not accumulation healthy tissue. accumulation
healthy mucus membranes tears things specifically
combating bacteria. So, know sounds little bit gross, is.
wiping away casualties battle fought night.
daytime, don't want introduce viruses things eyes much
possible. primary site entry. people wear goggles surgical units
things sort, try avoid getting things eyes. Very,
important. third way keep healthy line defense entire mucus
tract enhance proliferation good gut microbiota. best way enhance
quality gut microbiome mucus lining serves protective layer
along body ingest two four servings day fermented foods, low sugar


fermented foods. talked bunch times podcast,
data colleague, Justin Sonnenburg's lab Stanford Med. there, just
wiped eyes. Yep, got me. paper published journal "Cell,"
absolutely spectacular journal, really points fact people eat fermented
foods, two four servings per day, helps reduce activity certain cytokines. Now,
know are, right? Cells make cytokines call out, "help me, help me."
reduce amount cytokines, so-called inflammatom. Now doesn't render
cells vulnerable. reason saw reduction IL-6 IL-1,
cytokines people healthy gut microbiome,
fewer cells body infected outside infections therefore less
reason cells crying out, "help," thriving, not suffering. So,
don't wipe eyes, keep hands clean, everyone tells that, right? keep
hands clean, don't wipe eyes, nasal breather, not mouth breather,
unless speaking, exercising eating, keep healthy gut microbiome
eating two four servings day quality, low sugar, fermented foods, things like
sauerkraut, things like natto can access that. tried before, interesting.
sort acquired taste, kimchi, pickles, again, low sugar sources going
sources going effective this. now armed three ways
enhance function immune system combat infection is, like
think separate typical type information get get good sleep,
good nutrition, good social connection, et cetera. stuff still holds true,
three points think can really make

00:34:20 Interleukins Anti-Inflammatory

substantial difference terms bolstering immune system, immune system.
want mention, names going come several times
episode, interleukins like IL-6 IL-1 encourage inflammation,
"help me" signals call cells gobble invaders.
interleukins anti-inflammatory. one like highlight particular,
will come little bit interleukin-10. not IL, insert
number, not interleukins inflammatory, anti-inflammatory.

00:34:56 Sickness Behavior



important point keep mind go forward. Next, like talk
called sickness behavior. indeed category behavior call
sickness behavior informative things can avoid getting
sick. Now, notion sickness behavior goes back several decades more.
interesting way looking function immune system,
bridges us thing calling immune system T-
cells, B-cells, cytokines leukocytes, starts taking us realm
nervous system, course nervous system controls behavior.
sickness behavior suite responses tend undergo
feeling sick. going vary person person, general
categories things happen us wounded
sick dealing infection kind. examining sickness behavior
detail, can really informative routes can take health.
main thing sickness behavior tends involve slowing usual
levels activity. People start feel lethargic, feel like activities
previously relative ease difficult somewhat
overwhelming. thing start see people animals, way,
stop grooming, stop taking care themselves. Not necessarily stopped showering,
although oftentimes case, will stop hair, stop putting
makeup, depending whether not before, might stop. Animals
will stop licking grooming themselves. People will stop taking care cosmetic
appearance. Now not just don't care look sick,
overall suppression certain kinds activities
enhancement kinds activities. really important. Sickness behavior
actually motivated state. state designed accomplish certain things.
One features sickness behavior addition lethargic, loss
grooming, will loss appetite, right? Oftentimes people great appetite
normally just won't feel hungry all. several theories
be. One prominent idea literature discourage vomiting diarrhea,
course can infectious people. So, theory. don't know
ever tested directly, one idea. idea simply
harbor resources sake repair. want talk
told get extra sleep aren't feeling well rest. just like good two


three-year-old constantly asks, "why, why?" Good scientists, good people
interested health information always asking why. get
sleep? happens sleep get sleep sick?
shouldn't just push this? couple reasons
established literature. first seem something
useful slowing circulation ill. One idea data support
slow circulation, blood circulation, not running around
much running all, rather lying down, getting extra rest, maybe sleeping, maybe
even just remaining still, lymphatic system, carries lot immune-
related cells fluids, able ramp levels activity. So, interesting,
right? reducing circulation blood, increasing circulation lymphatic
system. probably familiar lymphatic system
combating infection, lymph nodes can get sore. got lymph nodes behind
ears, groin, armpits, around throat,

00:39:08 People Seek Care Sick, Others Want Alone

around near thyroid, throat, et cetera. So, reason. Now,
people, get sick, psychologically go vulnerable state
really, really want people, people take care them. probably
witnessed this, feel way yourself. 50% people response.
really want taken care of. Now, think adaptive
perspective, makes sense, right? member species ill
less will cry help one form another members species
take care them. course will especially apparent cases people
young enough incapacitated enough can't actually get resources
own. ever really sick, just getting going fridge
restroom can feel like monumental task. 50% people report describe
seeking help support sick. also imagine
non-adaptive response increases opportunity spread
infection caretaker. interesting consideration. Another 50% people
seem opposite response sick. So, somehow, regardless
prior getting ill, sickness behavior engaged neural
circuits brain, indeed neural circuits brain, create stay away


me. don't want bothered. want left alone. don't want taken care of,
right? not stubbornness. literally lack interest disinterest social
connection one sick. see animals too, animals will seek
members species. Others, like unfortunately now passed away
bulldog, Costello. sick always knew go around
back house just hide there. just take away
everybody else. not want taken care of. just natural response
him. don't think trying prevent getting whatever had.
ever somebody doesn't want taken care of, want taken care
of, realize people tend fall two bins naturally, animals tend fall
bins. Regardless species are, 50/50. again,
sickness behavior motivated state. designed slow circulation blood,
increase circulation lymph, killer cells body, reduce
probability infecting others reducing, thought, diarrhea vomit, also
breathing others, interacting others. cases will activate this, don't
want call regressed state, many people feel somewhat more...
adults, feel childlike ill want

00:42:00 Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines

taken care badly. might learned. might innate.
don't know, sickness behavior interesting couple reasons.
First all, mimics another state described neuroscience literature,
major depression. sick individuals, sick bacterial viral
infection, people major depression, shown robust
increases levels interleukin-6 tumor necrosis factor alpha.
idea now circulating depression involves inflammatory cytokines
active. know illness involves inflammatory cytokines active.
think it, similarity major depression sick
able point us direction interventions help us either prevent illness
move illness quickly. head direction, indeed
case, just want emphasize sickness behavior provides
bridge immune system nervous system. soon see
also healthy behavior, behavior allows us avoid infection, also points


clear bridge nervous system immune system. isn't just
brain body organs, immune system.
true, interacting time. going lead us place
going clear not surprising certain patterns thinking
certain behaviors

00:43:40 Reduced Appetites Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido

can elect take can help enhance immune system function vice versa.
two features sickness behavior definitely worth pointing out. One
theory, reduced appetite, particular appetite protein rich foods
sick, thought attempt, subconscious attempt, organism
reduce amount iron taking in. Now, typically amount iron intake
recommended less men, eight milligrams per day.
women, anywhere 18 27 milligrams per day, depending whether not
pregnant, lactating menstruating, et cetera, ranges can vary. But,
indeed, true iron levels blood go high, like 45 milligrams per day
can toxic system. theory prominent biology literature
health literature reduction appetite actually attempt
reduce iron intake specifically many bacteria forms infection seem
thrive levels iron blood high. don't want see anyone take
extreme suddenly iron deprivation diet order get well.
interesting theory remiss didn't mention, makes good sense.
Iron actually attached hemoglobin red blood cells bloodstream. Normally
can help us quite lot. also muscle, mention that. Iron can
sequestered muscle, iron serves lot important health promoting roles,
reducing appetite thereby reducing iron intake, reduce capacity
certain things, including infections travel certain compartments within body. So,
again, just theory, think many probably familiar not
appetite sick. thing typical people major
depression loss appetite, not always often loss appetite. So, again,
loss appetite sickness behavior, loss appetite major depression,
perhaps not surprisingly one major symptoms sickness behavior major
depression map less onto one another loss libido interest, not just


social interactions, sex reproduction. so, again, think
sickness behavior depression, very, similar. Okay, sickness
behavior major depression certain core features common. need
therefore ask sick influence way think
perceive environment impact appetite, whether not want
cared cared less? Again, people tend diverge two different bins
there,

00:46:45 Vagus-Nerve Stimulation: Fever, Photophobia, Sleepiness

believe not, pathway identified. infection
someplace body, head, sinus infection,
ear infection, also mention many mechanisms can
also consequence wound injury body. back injury slipped
disc guess called herniated disc way hear described.
that, can kind irritable, don't want certain things just want
left alone. Things harder. How? Why? Well, known pathway,
so-called vagus nerve connects body brain, signals particular
brain sites engage category motivational state call sickness behavior.
Many probably heard vagus, V-A-G-U-S, vagus. vagus nerve
extensive nerve pathway, 10th cranial nerve comes back
brainstem, heads body, branches extensively innervate connect
many organs, including lungs, heart, gut, et cetera.
organs able also send neural signals back brain. sometimes hear
vagus route calming down. Unfortunately, less
myth don't know got propagated. lots different pathways
vagus Usually vagal stimulation actually creates arousal alertness, although
multiple pathways, now many studies vagus
various contexts, including sickness behavior. clear vagus nerve
fast pathway infection body signaled brain,
particular location brain called hypothalamus, harbors lot different
types neurons. Neurons, instance, preoptic area increase body
temperature fever, right? one important things increase body
temperature, body's attempt kill off invader many viruses


many bacteria don't survive well elevated heat. function fever. fever
actually functional role. So, biology, like complicated words, call
anything increases body temperature creates fever, pyrogen. Many years
ago, undergraduate years, working pyrogens, injecting something called
lipopolysaccharide belly, gives fever. way
LPS causes inflammation response gut. gut doesn't know
happening. stomach cells don't know happening. just start secreting
IL-6, IL-1, cytokines, killer cells migrate gut.
sometimes get stomach ache don't feel well, flu, something
like it. neural signal, electrical signals get sent hypothalamus.
hypothalamus says, oh, don't know going there, signal
something's going on. just heat body. just start cooking whatever
there. course don't want fever go high can kill brain
cells. within particular range fever functional adaptive response, okay?
taking drugs try lower fever might make feel
comfortable, actually limiting response body creating order
try kill off invader. again, don't want fever go high. going
vary depending age. can look online tolerable ranges
fever. trying lower body temperature fever, unless
heading dangerous levels heating up, actually wrong way take
system indeed want kill off invader. Okay, vagus nerve
quick response. also sends input areas brain change perception
outside world. One obvious these, obvious tell you,
photophobia, right? love bright sunshine. love bright lights want alert.
different levels light sensitivity, people sick,
inflammation response body, feel like bright lights kind
aversive. get well-described kind classical photophobia, mediated
pathway goes eye area thalamus, called anterior
nucleus thalamus. work done Clifford Saper Harvard
Medical School. really beautiful work. outer lining
brain, meninges just sort outside brain brain starts
interface connective tissues. talk later.
can actually create photophobia headache one ill. So,
pathway: invader gets system 'cause wiped eyes got


mouth. didn't listen mother got eyes.
feeling sick. Something's going there. stomach ache
inflammation there, signal goes vagus nerve. heating
fever. got photophobia activated pathway
normally tolerable light triggering thalamic nucleus, anterior
thalamus, projecting meninges. got headache response
looking light. basically triggering overall pathway get go quiet,
dark place rest. last element like talk rest.
something gets triggered body brain, hypothalamus,
think know hypothalamic area is. supraoptic nucleus, think.
Supraoptic 'cause right so-called optic chiasm, want look
is, right roof mouth. nuclei
promote desire sleep even daytime, normally active
phase circadian cycle.

00:53:03 Humoral (Blood-Borne) Factors, & Choroid Change Brain State

Now, really interesting happening got multiple
pathways saying avoid light, reduce amount behavior, heat up,
things making sick. sickness behavior, going body
mind make right thing. Now also slow pathway
purely mediated blood, so-called humoral factors. Not 'cause funny,
humoral factors factors blood. infection many hours
days, amount IL-6 IL-1 tumor necrosis factor inflammatory
cytokines starting increase total amount circulation gets high
enough communicated brain. tends enter brain
particular type tissue really interesting called choroid, C-H-O-R-O-I-D. Choroid
really interesting. kind fluffy tissue sits ventricles. ventricles
spaces brain, spaces brain called cerebral
spinal fluid them. cerebral spinal fluid contains number important things,
choroid starts releasing responding cytokines, inflammatory
cytokines, brain actually starts experience sorts changes terms
inflammation neurons, memory tends get poor, cognition tends get
poor. transient things often. Eventually things will pass,


deep sickness really feeling lousy. can't read, can't watch
movie, can't anything. ever get sick just can't bothered
anything, probably fast response body
also slower response literally set tissues brain
sending inflammatory signals. now whole brain starting
cope,

00:55:04 Tools 4, 5: Reducing Sickness: Glymphatic Clearance, Pre-Sleep Serotonin,
5HTP

trying cope infection. got slow pathway fast pathway.
sounds really terrible. So, now, like talk can reduce
probability getting sick. actually things one can start
get sick sick, accelerate healing process flipping
equation. now talking body activates certain areas
brain create sickness behavior much like depression. probably
familiar anytime cold flu something really lousy
injury. Now, flip equation ask can nervous system
order enhance function immune system order able heal
recover illness injury quickly. say unfortunate
circumstance waking one day coming home, got tickle
throat, breathe, nasal passages don't feel way. got
little bit headache. feeling kind off. know do.
hydrate, drink water go sleep. Right, told,
actually things can actively order get immune system
deploy robust response early phase potential infection. focus first
rest component. Yes, course told take hot shower
go sleep, get nine 10 hours sleep. interesting way
looking sleep, specifically role enhancing immune system.
wonderful review, put review captions looked specifically
literature surrounding sleep different occurs support immune
system. normally go sleep, slow-wave sleep predominantly
early phase night, time sleep longer longer, get
so-called REM, rapid eye movement sleep. talked episodes


sleep. course slow-wave sleep REM sleep throughout night
always, fraction slow-wave sleep REM sleep shifts,
different functions, et cetera. evidence sleep associated
infection, particular, early stage infection, associated elevated levels
serotonin brain either adaptive mechanism whatever reason,
neurons brain so-called raphe nucleus start releasing serotonin.
serotonin related pathways can help enhance immune
system function combat infection. starting data,
emphasize starting not robust literature yet, looking whether not
supplementing precursors serotonin like 5-HTP, can taken supplement
form consuming foods increase serotonin naturally. foods
contain high levels tryptophan. can look are. So, white meat
turkey, instance, certain complex carbohydrates can often rich tryptophan.
consuming foods can enhance amount serotonin available

couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard

case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4

remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast

are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine

Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types

nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal
prominent "Nature" featuring upfront, think really mark
beginning new path medicine. just underscore point little bit further,
National Institutes Health, course cancer institute, eye institute,
deal trying combat cancer cure blindness forth. now
called NCCIH, complimentary health. so, good tax
dollars put kinds explorations talking undoubtedly
going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times
hope learning new emerging science hearing
protocols either zero cost low cost, certainly respiration

make system, things allowed move system
can extract nutrients them. reason talking first category
barrier immune system detail like envision human,
course, human clear entity everything else.
bring right things keep wrong things kill them. Now,
inevitably, bacteria, viruses, parasitic infections going make way
body, whether not killed off whether not take cause us
harm going determined layers two three. So, layers two three
so-called innate immune system adaptive immune system. innate
immune system call second layer defense. fast.
whether not bacteria, virus, parasite, happens something
enter body, maybe swallowed it, maybe got eyes, maybe
shook somebody's hand carrying particular kind illness, wiped
eyes. talked podcast before, soon meet another
person, usually within 30 seconds, believe not, people wipe person's
chemicals somewhere face body's surface.
demonstrated again. want learn that,
episode chemical signaling, can learn it. know sounds
weird might say, "I don't that," indeed do, time
everybody does. Okay, so, innate immune system rapid response
something enters system body doesn't recognize it. not food, not
clean air, something either bacteria, virus parasite. innate immune
system involves release

00:17:08 Killer Cells, Complement Proteins (“Eat Me!” Signals), Cytokines (“Help Me!”
Signals)

particular cells waiting dormant, ready attack whatever invader is.
cell types heard before. typical one so-called
white blood cells. So, white blood cells will actively go site invasion will
start encapsulate try surround given invader. names
different cell types things like neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells just
many types immune cells. kind like ambulance system,
rather go try heal something like paramedic would, go


try surround kill whatever invader is. work concert two
assistants, assistants called compliment proteins. Compliment
proteins exist blood, travel sites
invasion mark certain things engulfed eaten. sort put
"eat me" tag it. basically put chemical tag onto invaders allows
white blood cells, neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells say, "Ah, need
basically kill thing, wrap body bag send off. Kill thing,
wrap body bag send off." using analogy body bag,
sense right one rather cells come kill things, way
actually engulf invading bacteria, virus parasite. actually
surround it. see puss see infection maybe cut skin
something like that, even ingrown hair gets bacteria it, puss
white part, know kind gross talk about, white blood
cells, oftentimes dead cells, dead invader sitting there. trying
create isolated compartment 'cause wants keep part body. Okay,
got innate immune system, compliment comes blood
helps tagging certain things "eat me" signal. cells
either damaged injury parasite, suffering
bacteria virus itself, cells body will also release alarm
signal, not "eat me" signal, "help me" signal. "help me"
signals come form call cytokines. cytokines things like
interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha. may heard
things curious learning health space,
online health space, especially last years, inflammation buzz word
now. Everyone's talking inflammation, inflammation, inflammation.
mean say inflammation? Well, inflammation physical response, also
chemical response. many times markers inflammation measured
people animal models research done, things like interleukin-1,
interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha. go blood, sign
somewhere cell saying "help me, help me." secreting
things calls neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells, white blood
cells, okay? might help remember this, just telling people
interleukin means communicate, right? interleukin shouting "help me,"
compliment proteins coming saying, "eat this" tagging invader


"eat me" signal. killer cells white blood cells
job trying kill off thing. innate immune system. So, skin
mucus lining plus innate immune system beautiful two-layered

00:21:06 Adaptive Immune System: Antibodies

set defenses various kinds invaders infections.
third type, adaptive immune system. notice leading
now, haven't said word antibody all, job not
skin mucus microbiome innate immune system produce antibodies
can recognize specific invaders, rather job adaptive immune
system create antibodies bacteria, viruses, even parasites even
physical intruders system. So, adaptive immune system incredible
ability show site invasion infection inflammation. called
various cues, including cytokines talked earlier.
actually attaches creates sort imprint shape whatever invader
happens there. particular invading bacteria virus contour
kind rippled kind spiky whatever shape happens have, creates
imprint that. then, using imprint concert cells, creates
antibodies specific recognize invader body ever
invader inside again. Now, called adaptive immune system.
many ways creates memory prior infection antibodies can made
anytime invader comes back again, right? so, basis
call immunity. basis call enhanced ability combat certain
types infections. really wonderful, mean, can't even state
incredible really is, bodies capacity, right?
something called leukocytes. essentially white blood cells. red blood
cells white blood cells, derived type origin cell.
stem cell. hear stem cell, stem cell just means cell can become
many different types cells. sometimes hear stem cells terms
people getting injections stem cells potential therapeutic effects
potential stem cells. harbor certain stem cells within us well, can
become lots different cell types. one particular type stem cell,
hematopoietic stem cell, can give rise red blood cells white blood cells.


general, reside marrow, least adults. So, bone marrow,
ability make certain cells can go called
chemically, get called sites infection create antibodies,
maintain antibodies system, memory particular infection
infection comes back again, can kill off immediately. doesn't
pass multiple stages first, innate response, adaptive
response, taking time. Now, lot details adaptive immune
system, just want emphasize points might relevant. First all,
name antibodies created sometimes come form IgM IgG,
things sort. isn't full deep dive immunology class, Ig stands
immunoglobulin, okay? immunoglobulins part adaptive immune
response creating antibodies. hear IgM, IgM first adaptive
immune responses, tends come earlier. somebody immunopositive
IgM particular type viral bacterial invader, means fairly
recent infection. Later, one creates... adaptive immune system, say,
creates IgG, stable form specific antibody going
recognize given invader. IgG tends come little bit later. So, just recap,
something gets system eyes, hole skin,
cut, mouth, sexually transmitted diseases come mucus
membranes genitalia genitalia, sexually transmitted disease,
airborne disease, gets mucus, somehow gets bloodstream.
innate response, general response trying contain combat
infection invader. adaptive response one generates
antibodies. First, IgM response, immunoglobulin-M response,
immunoglobulin-G response, IgG response. So, keep three barriers
three defense systems infection tuned up? Well, leaving aside list things
mentioned generally enhances function, things like sleep
sunlight good nutrition, et cetera, sort generic things good health, one
key ways can keep mucus lining really good shape.
mean? Well, mucus lining needs turn quite often needs
correct chemistry trap bad stuff permeable good
stuff, nutrients need. now clear hundreds, not
thousands studies best way maintain healthy so-called
microbiome. microbiome little bacterial organisms good us


live along mucus pathways even eyes. Now, just really clear,
not just gut microbiome; actually microbiome eyes,
one specific mouth, nasal specific microbiome, one
along gut species microbiota live along digestive tract differ
mouth, throat, stomach, intestines, rectum. well-
established healthy microbiota live along length,
differ along length. also urethral microbiota, vaginal
microbiota promotes health environment well. one can
maintain healthy microbiota not favor growth harmful bacteria, allow
mucus lining become permeable bad stuff can come
environment?

00:28:00 Tool 1: Nasal Microbiome “Scrubbing” Bacteria & Viruses; Nasal Breathing

Well, far know, three main ways that. first two purely
structural mechanical. clear now work, done
Stanford, elsewhere well, nasal microbiome particularly good
scrubbing bacteria, preventing certain types infections. So, reminder
whenever possible, unless eating speaking, want nasal breathing, not
breathing mouth. nose much better filter viruses bacteria
mouth. mouth contains certain structural features, even organs cell
types can protect incoming infection, don't want mouth
breather variety reasons. terrific book called "Jaws: Hidden
Epidemic," written colleagues, Sandra Kahn Paul Ehrlich
Stanford, Stanford Medicine foreword Jared Diamond Robert
Sapolsky. really lot heavy hitters book talks increase
infection one gets breathing mouth, opposed nose. Now,
course, hard exercise, one breathes mouth, not necessarily
bad. one eating speaking, not necessarily bad all. guess depends
saying. joke. general, possible want
breathing nose. Many people trouble breathing nose
so-called deviated septums chronically collapsed sinuses. best way
dilate sinuses actually breathe nose. can take little bit
time, plasticity sinuses. so, nose breather, not mouth


breather, will combat infections constantly confronted with.
mention always bombarded different types bacteria, viruses,
parasites environment. goal course, reinforce immune
system, can keep things bay not get sick. actually paper
published Cell Reports, "Cell Press Journal," excellent journal showed
nasal microbiome, particular species microbiota good fighting
off infection. not direct link particular patterns nasal
breathing nasal microbiome yet, oxygenation environment
breathing nose, turns quite important overall enhancing
filter. don't just think nose something

00:30:33 Tools 2 & 3: (Not) Touching Eyes; Gut Microbiome & Fermented Foods

smell foods bring air. also active filter things invade you.
way try keep bad things avoid getting sick advice
mother, certainly mother gave me, not touch eyes
touching people touching surfaces. mentioned earlier, tend
subconsciously. reason avoid eyes primary entry
point lot bacteria viruses. constantly lubricating surface
eyes so-called lacrimal glands, tears things sort. ever
noticed wake morning, sleep eyes, know
kind crusty stuff corners eyes eyelashes, sleep,
crust actually dead bacteria successfully battled night. Okay,
is. not accumulation healthy tissue. accumulation
healthy mucus membranes tears things specifically
combating bacteria. So, know sounds little bit gross, is.
wiping away casualties battle fought night.
daytime, don't want introduce viruses things eyes much
possible. primary site entry. people wear goggles surgical units
things sort, try avoid getting things eyes. Very,
important. third way keep healthy line defense entire mucus
tract enhance proliferation good gut microbiota. best way enhance
quality gut microbiome mucus lining serves protective layer
along body ingest two four servings day fermented foods, low sugar


fermented foods. talked bunch times podcast,
data colleague, Justin Sonnenburg's lab Stanford Med. there, just
wiped eyes. Yep, got me. paper published journal "Cell,"
absolutely spectacular journal, really points fact people eat fermented
foods, two four servings per day, helps reduce activity certain cytokines. Now,
know are, right? Cells make cytokines call out, "help me, help me."
reduce amount cytokines, so-called inflammatom. Now doesn't render
cells vulnerable. reason saw reduction IL-6 IL-1,
cytokines people healthy gut microbiome,
fewer cells body infected outside infections therefore less
reason cells crying out, "help," thriving, not suffering. So,
don't wipe eyes, keep hands clean, everyone tells that, right? keep
hands clean, don't wipe eyes, nasal breather, not mouth breather,
unless speaking, exercising eating, keep healthy gut microbiome
eating two four servings day quality, low sugar, fermented foods, things like
sauerkraut, things like natto can access that. tried before, interesting.
sort acquired taste, kimchi, pickles, again, low sugar sources going
sources going effective this. now armed three ways
enhance function immune system combat infection is, like
think separate typical type information get get good sleep,
good nutrition, good social connection, et cetera. stuff still holds true,
three points think can really make

00:34:20 Interleukins Anti-Inflammatory

substantial difference terms bolstering immune system, immune system.
want mention, names going come several times
episode, interleukins like IL-6 IL-1 encourage inflammation,
"help me" signals call cells gobble invaders.
interleukins anti-inflammatory. one like highlight particular,
will come little bit interleukin-10. not IL, insert
number, not interleukins inflammatory, anti-inflammatory.

00:34:56 Sickness Behavior



important point keep mind go forward. Next, like talk
called sickness behavior. indeed category behavior call
sickness behavior informative things can avoid getting
sick. Now, notion sickness behavior goes back several decades more.
interesting way looking function immune system,
bridges us thing calling immune system T-
cells, B-cells, cytokines leukocytes, starts taking us realm
nervous system, course nervous system controls behavior.
sickness behavior suite responses tend undergo
feeling sick. going vary person person, general
categories things happen us wounded
sick dealing infection kind. examining sickness behavior
detail, can really informative routes can take health.
main thing sickness behavior tends involve slowing usual
levels activity. People start feel lethargic, feel like activities
previously relative ease difficult somewhat
overwhelming. thing start see people animals, way,
stop grooming, stop taking care themselves. Not necessarily stopped showering,
although oftentimes case, will stop hair, stop putting
makeup, depending whether not before, might stop. Animals
will stop licking grooming themselves. People will stop taking care cosmetic
appearance. Now not just don't care look sick,
overall suppression certain kinds activities
enhancement kinds activities. really important. Sickness behavior
actually motivated state. state designed accomplish certain things.
One features sickness behavior addition lethargic, loss
grooming, will loss appetite, right? Oftentimes people great appetite
normally just won't feel hungry all. several theories
be. One prominent idea literature discourage vomiting diarrhea,
course can infectious people. So, theory. don't know
ever tested directly, one idea. idea simply
harbor resources sake repair. want talk
told get extra sleep aren't feeling well rest. just like good two


three-year-old constantly asks, "why, why?" Good scientists, good people
interested health information always asking why. get
sleep? happens sleep get sleep sick?
shouldn't just push this? couple reasons
established literature. first seem something
useful slowing circulation ill. One idea data support
slow circulation, blood circulation, not running around
much running all, rather lying down, getting extra rest, maybe sleeping, maybe
even just remaining still, lymphatic system, carries lot immune-
related cells fluids, able ramp levels activity. So, interesting,
right? reducing circulation blood, increasing circulation lymphatic
system. probably familiar lymphatic system
combating infection, lymph nodes can get sore. got lymph nodes behind
ears, groin, armpits, around throat,

00:39:08 People Seek Care Sick, Others Want Alone

around near thyroid, throat, et cetera. So, reason. Now,
people, get sick, psychologically go vulnerable state
really, really want people, people take care them. probably
witnessed this, feel way yourself. 50% people response.
really want taken care of. Now, think adaptive
perspective, makes sense, right? member species ill
less will cry help one form another members species
take care them. course will especially apparent cases people
young enough incapacitated enough can't actually get resources
own. ever really sick, just getting going fridge
restroom can feel like monumental task. 50% people report describe
seeking help support sick. also imagine
non-adaptive response increases opportunity spread
infection caretaker. interesting consideration. Another 50% people
seem opposite response sick. So, somehow, regardless
prior getting ill, sickness behavior engaged neural
circuits brain, indeed neural circuits brain, create stay away


me. don't want bothered. want left alone. don't want taken care of,
right? not stubbornness. literally lack interest disinterest social
connection one sick. see animals too, animals will seek
members species. Others, like unfortunately now passed away
bulldog, Costello. sick always knew go around
back house just hide there. just take away
everybody else. not want taken care of. just natural response
him. don't think trying prevent getting whatever had.
ever somebody doesn't want taken care of, want taken care
of, realize people tend fall two bins naturally, animals tend fall
bins. Regardless species are, 50/50. again,
sickness behavior motivated state. designed slow circulation blood,
increase circulation lymph, killer cells body, reduce
probability infecting others reducing, thought, diarrhea vomit, also
breathing others, interacting others. cases will activate this, don't
want call regressed state, many people feel somewhat more...
adults, feel childlike ill want

00:42:00 Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines

taken care badly. might learned. might innate.
don't know, sickness behavior interesting couple reasons.
First all, mimics another state described neuroscience literature,
major depression. sick individuals, sick bacterial viral
infection, people major depression, shown robust
increases levels interleukin-6 tumor necrosis factor alpha.
idea now circulating depression involves inflammatory cytokines
active. know illness involves inflammatory cytokines active.
think it, similarity major depression sick
able point us direction interventions help us either prevent illness
move illness quickly. head direction, indeed
case, just want emphasize sickness behavior provides
bridge immune system nervous system. soon see
also healthy behavior, behavior allows us avoid infection, also points


clear bridge nervous system immune system. isn't just
brain body organs, immune system.
true, interacting time. going lead us place
going clear not surprising certain patterns thinking
certain behaviors

00:43:40 Reduced Appetites Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido

can elect take can help enhance immune system function vice versa.
two features sickness behavior definitely worth pointing out. One
theory, reduced appetite, particular appetite protein rich foods
sick, thought attempt, subconscious attempt, organism
reduce amount iron taking in. Now, typically amount iron intake
recommended less men, eight milligrams per day.
women, anywhere 18 27 milligrams per day, depending whether not
pregnant, lactating menstruating, et cetera, ranges can vary. But,
indeed, true iron levels blood go high, like 45 milligrams per day
can toxic system. theory prominent biology literature
health literature reduction appetite actually attempt
reduce iron intake specifically many bacteria forms infection seem
thrive levels iron blood high. don't want see anyone take
extreme suddenly iron deprivation diet order get well.
interesting theory remiss didn't mention, makes good sense.
Iron actually attached hemoglobin red blood cells bloodstream. Normally
can help us quite lot. also muscle, mention that. Iron can
sequestered muscle, iron serves lot important health promoting roles,
reducing appetite thereby reducing iron intake, reduce capacity
certain things, including infections travel certain compartments within body. So,
again, just theory, think many probably familiar not
appetite sick. thing typical people major
depression loss appetite, not always often loss appetite. So, again,
loss appetite sickness behavior, loss appetite major depression,
perhaps not surprisingly one major symptoms sickness behavior major
depression map less onto one another loss libido interest, not just


social interactions, sex reproduction. so, again, think
sickness behavior depression, very, similar. Okay, sickness
behavior major depression certain core features common. need
therefore ask sick influence way think
perceive environment impact appetite, whether not want
cared cared less? Again, people tend diverge two different bins
there,

00:46:45 Vagus-Nerve Stimulation: Fever, Photophobia, Sleepiness

believe not, pathway identified. infection
someplace body, head, sinus infection,
ear infection, also mention many mechanisms can
also consequence wound injury body. back injury slipped
disc guess called herniated disc way hear described.
that, can kind irritable, don't want certain things just want
left alone. Things harder. How? Why? Well, known pathway,
so-called vagus nerve connects body brain, signals particular
brain sites engage category motivational state call sickness behavior.
Many probably heard vagus, V-A-G-U-S, vagus. vagus nerve
extensive nerve pathway, 10th cranial nerve comes back
brainstem, heads body, branches extensively innervate connect
many organs, including lungs, heart, gut, et cetera.
organs able also send neural signals back brain. sometimes hear
vagus route calming down. Unfortunately, less
myth don't know got propagated. lots different pathways
vagus Usually vagal stimulation actually creates arousal alertness, although
multiple pathways, now many studies vagus
various contexts, including sickness behavior. clear vagus nerve
fast pathway infection body signaled brain,
particular location brain called hypothalamus, harbors lot different
types neurons. Neurons, instance, preoptic area increase body
temperature fever, right? one important things increase body
temperature, body's attempt kill off invader many viruses


many bacteria don't survive well elevated heat. function fever. fever
actually functional role. So, biology, like complicated words, call
anything increases body temperature creates fever, pyrogen. Many years
ago, undergraduate years, working pyrogens, injecting something called
lipopolysaccharide belly, gives fever. way
LPS causes inflammation response gut. gut doesn't know
happening. stomach cells don't know happening. just start secreting
IL-6, IL-1, cytokines, killer cells migrate gut.
sometimes get stomach ache don't feel well, flu, something
like it. neural signal, electrical signals get sent hypothalamus.
hypothalamus says, oh, don't know going there, signal
something's going on. just heat body. just start cooking whatever
there. course don't want fever go high can kill brain
cells. within particular range fever functional adaptive response, okay?
taking drugs try lower fever might make feel
comfortable, actually limiting response body creating order
try kill off invader. again, don't want fever go high. going
vary depending age. can look online tolerable ranges
fever. trying lower body temperature fever, unless
heading dangerous levels heating up, actually wrong way take
system indeed want kill off invader. Okay, vagus nerve

00:53:03 Humoral (Blood-Borne) Factors, & Choroid Change Brain State

Now, really interesting happening got multiple
pathways saying avoid light, reduce amount behavior, heat up,
things making sick. sickness behavior, going body
mind make right thing. Now also slow pathway
purely mediated blood, so-called humoral factors. Not 'cause funny,
humoral factors factors blood. infection many hours
days, amount IL-6 IL-1 tumor necrosis factor inflammatory
cytokines starting increase total amount circulation gets high
enough communicated brain. tends enter brain
particular type tissue really interesting called choroid, C-H-O-R-O-I-D. Choroid
really interesting. kind fluffy tissue sits ventricles. ventricles
spaces brain, spaces brain called cerebral
spinal fluid them. cerebral spinal fluid contains number important things,
choroid starts releasing responding cytokines, inflammatory
cytokines, brain actually starts experience sorts changes terms
inflammation neurons, memory tends get poor, cognition tends get
poor. transient things often. Eventually things will pass,


deep sickness really feeling lousy. can't read, can't watch
movie, can't anything. ever get sick just can't bothered
anything, probably fast response body
also slower response literally set tissues brain

sounds really terrible. So, now, like talk can reduce
probability getting sick. actually things one can start
get sick sick, accelerate healing process flipping

familiar anytime cold flu something really lousy

actually things can actively order get immune system

So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various

one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline

ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling

Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types

So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,

vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked

try surround kill whatever invader is. work concert two
assistants, assistants called compliment proteins. Compliment
proteins exist blood, travel sites
invasion mark certain things engulfed eaten. sort put
"eat me" tag it. basically put chemical tag onto invaders allows
white blood cells, neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells say, "Ah, need
basically kill thing, wrap body bag send off. Kill thing,
wrap body bag send off." using analogy body bag,
sense right one rather cells come kill things, way
actually engulf invading bacteria, virus parasite. actually
surround it. see puss see infection maybe cut skin
something like that, even ingrown hair gets bacteria it, puss
white part, know kind gross talk about, white blood
cells, oftentimes dead cells, dead invader sitting there. trying
create isolated compartment 'cause wants keep part body. Okay,
got innate immune system, compliment comes blood
helps tagging certain things "eat me" signal. cells
either damaged injury parasite, suffering
bacteria virus itself, cells body will also release alarm
signal, not "eat me" signal, "help me" signal. "help me"
signals come form call cytokines. cytokines things like
interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha. may heard
things curious learning health space,
online health space, especially last years, inflammation buzz word
now. Everyone's talking inflammation, inflammation, inflammation.
mean say inflammation? Well, inflammation physical response, also
chemical response. many times markers inflammation measured
people animal models research done, things like interleukin-1,
interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha. go blood, sign
somewhere cell saying "help me, help me." secreting
things calls neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells, white blood
cells, okay? might help remember this, just telling people
interleukin means communicate, right? interleukin shouting "help me,"
compliment proteins coming saying, "eat this" tagging invader


"eat me" signal. killer cells white blood cells
job trying kill off thing. innate immune system. So, skin
mucus lining plus innate immune system beautiful two-layered

00:21:06 Adaptive Immune System: Antibodies

set defenses various kinds invaders infections.
third type, adaptive immune system. notice leading
now, haven't said word antibody all, job not
skin mucus microbiome innate immune system produce antibodies
can recognize specific invaders, rather job adaptive immune
system create antibodies bacteria, viruses, even parasites even
physical intruders system. So, adaptive immune system incredible
ability show site invasion infection inflammation. called
various cues, including cytokines talked earlier.
actually attaches creates sort imprint shape whatever invader
happens there. particular invading bacteria virus contour
kind rippled kind spiky whatever shape happens have, creates
imprint that. then, using imprint concert cells, creates
antibodies specific recognize invader body ever
invader inside again. Now, called adaptive immune system.
many ways creates memory prior infection antibodies can made
anytime invader comes back again, right? so, basis
call immunity. basis call enhanced ability combat certain
types infections. really wonderful, mean, can't even state
incredible really is, bodies capacity, right?
something called leukocytes. essentially white blood cells. red blood
cells white blood cells, derived type origin cell.
stem cell. hear stem cell, stem cell just means cell can become
many different types cells. sometimes hear stem cells terms
people getting injections stem cells potential therapeutic effects
potential stem cells. harbor certain stem cells within us well, can
become lots different cell types. one particular type stem cell,
hematopoietic stem cell, can give rise red blood cells white blood cells.


general, reside marrow, least adults. So, bone marrow,
ability make certain cells can go called
chemically, get called sites infection create antibodies,
maintain antibodies system, memory particular infection
infection comes back again, can kill off immediately. doesn't
pass multiple stages first, innate response, adaptive
response, taking time. Now, lot details adaptive immune
system, just want emphasize points might relevant. First all,
name antibodies created sometimes come form IgM IgG,
things sort. isn't full deep dive immunology class, Ig stands
immunoglobulin, okay? immunoglobulins part adaptive immune
response creating antibodies. hear IgM, IgM first adaptive
immune responses, tends come earlier. somebody immunopositive
IgM particular type viral bacterial invader, means fairly
recent infection. Later, one creates... adaptive immune system, say,
creates IgG, stable form specific antibody going
recognize given invader. IgG tends come little bit later. So, just recap,
something gets system eyes, hole skin,
cut, mouth, sexually transmitted diseases come mucus
membranes genitalia genitalia, sexually transmitted disease,
airborne disease, gets mucus, somehow gets bloodstream.
innate response, general response trying contain combat
infection invader. adaptive response one generates
antibodies. First, IgM response, immunoglobulin-M response,
immunoglobulin-G response, IgG response. So, keep three barriers
three defense systems infection tuned up? Well, leaving aside list things
mentioned generally enhances function, things like sleep
sunlight good nutrition, et cetera, sort generic things good health, one
key ways can keep mucus lining really good shape.
mean? Well, mucus lining needs turn quite often needs
correct chemistry trap bad stuff permeable good
stuff, nutrients need. now clear hundreds, not
thousands studies best way maintain healthy so-called
microbiome. microbiome little bacterial organisms good us


live along mucus pathways even eyes. Now, just really clear,
not just gut microbiome; actually microbiome eyes,
one specific mouth, nasal specific microbiome, one
along gut species microbiota live along digestive tract differ
mouth, throat, stomach, intestines, rectum. well-
established healthy microbiota live along length,
differ along length. also urethral microbiota, vaginal
microbiota promotes health environment well. one can
maintain healthy microbiota not favor growth harmful bacteria, allow
mucus lining become permeable bad stuff can come
environment?

00:28:00 Tool 1: Nasal Microbiome “Scrubbing” Bacteria & Viruses; Nasal Breathing

Well, far know, three main ways that. first two purely
structural mechanical. clear now work, done
Stanford, elsewhere well, nasal microbiome particularly good
scrubbing bacteria, preventing certain types infections. So, reminder
whenever possible, unless eating speaking, want nasal breathing, not
breathing mouth. nose much better filter viruses bacteria
mouth. mouth contains certain structural features, even organs cell
types can protect incoming infection, don't want mouth
breather variety reasons. terrific book called "Jaws: Hidden
Epidemic," written colleagues, Sandra Kahn Paul Ehrlich
Stanford, Stanford Medicine foreword Jared Diamond Robert
Sapolsky. really lot heavy hitters book talks increase
infection one gets breathing mouth, opposed nose. Now,
course, hard exercise, one breathes mouth, not necessarily
bad. one eating speaking, not necessarily bad all. guess depends
saying. joke. general, possible want
breathing nose. Many people trouble breathing nose
so-called deviated septums chronically collapsed sinuses. best way
dilate sinuses actually breathe nose. can take little bit
time, plasticity sinuses. so, nose breather, not mouth


breather, will combat infections constantly confronted with.
mention always bombarded different types bacteria, viruses,
parasites environment. goal course, reinforce immune
system, can keep things bay not get sick. actually paper
published Cell Reports, "Cell Press Journal," excellent journal showed
nasal microbiome, particular species microbiota good fighting
off infection. not direct link particular patterns nasal
breathing nasal microbiome yet, oxygenation environment
breathing nose, turns quite important overall enhancing
filter. don't just think nose something

00:30:33 Tools 2 & 3: (Not) Touching Eyes; Gut Microbiome & Fermented Foods

smell foods bring air. also active filter things invade you.
way try keep bad things avoid getting sick advice
mother, certainly mother gave me, not touch eyes
touching people touching surfaces. mentioned earlier, tend
subconsciously. reason avoid eyes primary entry
point lot bacteria viruses. constantly lubricating surface
eyes so-called lacrimal glands, tears things sort. ever
noticed wake morning, sleep eyes, know
kind crusty stuff corners eyes eyelashes, sleep,
crust actually dead bacteria successfully battled night. Okay,
is. not accumulation healthy tissue. accumulation
healthy mucus membranes tears things specifically
combating bacteria. So, know sounds little bit gross, is.
wiping away casualties battle fought night.
daytime, don't want introduce viruses things eyes much
possible. primary site entry. people wear goggles surgical units
things sort, try avoid getting things eyes. Very,
important. third way keep healthy line defense entire mucus
tract enhance proliferation good gut microbiota. best way enhance
quality gut microbiome mucus lining serves protective layer
along body ingest two four servings day fermented foods, low sugar


fermented foods. talked bunch times podcast,
data colleague, Justin Sonnenburg's lab Stanford Med. there, just
wiped eyes. Yep, got me. paper published journal "Cell,"
absolutely spectacular journal, really points fact people eat fermented
foods, two four servings per day, helps reduce activity certain cytokines. Now,
know are, right? Cells make cytokines call out, "help me, help me."
reduce amount cytokines, so-called inflammatom. Now doesn't render
cells vulnerable. reason saw reduction IL-6 IL-1,
cytokines people healthy gut microbiome,
fewer cells body infected outside infections therefore less
reason cells crying out, "help," thriving, not suffering. So,
don't wipe eyes, keep hands clean, everyone tells that, right? keep
hands clean, don't wipe eyes, nasal breather, not mouth breather,
unless speaking, exercising eating, keep healthy gut microbiome
eating two four servings day quality, low sugar, fermented foods, things like
sauerkraut, things like natto can access that. tried before, interesting.
sort acquired taste, kimchi, pickles, again, low sugar sources going
sources going effective this. now armed three ways
enhance function immune system combat infection is, like
think separate typical type information get get good sleep,
good nutrition, good social connection, et cetera. stuff still holds true,
three points think can really make

00:34:20 Interleukins Anti-Inflammatory

substantial difference terms bolstering immune system, immune system.
want mention, names going come several times
episode, interleukins like IL-6 IL-1 encourage inflammation,
"help me" signals call cells gobble invaders.
interleukins anti-inflammatory. one like highlight particular,
will come little bit interleukin-10. not IL, insert
number, not interleukins inflammatory, anti-inflammatory.

00:34:56 Sickness Behavior



important point keep mind go forward. Next, like talk
called sickness behavior. indeed category behavior call
sickness behavior informative things can avoid getting
sick. Now, notion sickness behavior goes back several decades more.
interesting way looking function immune system,
bridges us thing calling immune system T-
cells, B-cells, cytokines leukocytes, starts taking us realm
nervous system, course nervous system controls behavior.
sickness behavior suite responses tend undergo
feeling sick. going vary person person, general
categories things happen us wounded
sick dealing infection kind. examining sickness behavior
detail, can really informative routes can take health.
main thing sickness behavior tends involve slowing usual
levels activity. People start feel lethargic, feel like activities
previously relative ease difficult somewhat
overwhelming. thing start see people animals, way,
stop grooming, stop taking care themselves. Not necessarily stopped showering,
although oftentimes case, will stop hair, stop putting
makeup, depending whether not before, might stop. Animals
will stop licking grooming themselves. People will stop taking care cosmetic
appearance. Now not just don't care look sick,
overall suppression certain kinds activities
enhancement kinds activities. really important. Sickness behavior
actually motivated state. state designed accomplish certain things.
One features sickness behavior addition lethargic, loss
grooming, will loss appetite, right? Oftentimes people great appetite
normally just won't feel hungry all. several theories
be. One prominent idea literature discourage vomiting diarrhea,
course can infectious people. So, theory. don't know
ever tested directly, one idea. idea simply
harbor resources sake repair. want talk
told get extra sleep aren't feeling well rest. just like good two


three-year-old constantly asks, "why, why?" Good scientists, good people
interested health information always asking why. get
sleep? happens sleep get sleep sick?
shouldn't just push this? couple reasons
established literature. first seem something
useful slowing circulation ill. One idea data support
slow circulation, blood circulation, not running around
much running all, rather lying down, getting extra rest, maybe sleeping, maybe
even just remaining still, lymphatic system, carries lot immune-
related cells fluids, able ramp levels activity. So, interesting,
right? reducing circulation blood, increasing circulation lymphatic
system. probably familiar lymphatic system
combating infection, lymph nodes can get sore. got lymph nodes behind
ears, groin, armpits, around throat,

00:39:08 People Seek Care Sick, Others Want Alone

around near thyroid, throat, et cetera. So, reason. Now,
people, get sick, psychologically go vulnerable state
really, really want people, people take care them. probably
witnessed this, feel way yourself. 50% people response.
really want taken care of. Now, think adaptive
perspective, makes sense, right? member species ill
less will cry help one form another members species
take care them. course will especially apparent cases people
young enough incapacitated enough can't actually get resources
own. ever really sick, just getting going fridge
restroom can feel like monumental task. 50% people report describe
seeking help support sick. also imagine
non-adaptive response increases opportunity spread
infection caretaker. interesting consideration. Another 50% people
seem opposite response sick. So, somehow, regardless
prior getting ill, sickness behavior engaged neural
circuits brain, indeed neural circuits brain, create stay away


me. don't want bothered. want left alone. don't want taken care of,
right? not stubbornness. literally lack interest disinterest social
connection one sick. see animals too, animals will seek
members species. Others, like unfortunately now passed away
bulldog, Costello. sick always knew go around
back house just hide there. just take away
everybody else. not want taken care of. just natural response
him. don't think trying prevent getting whatever had.
ever somebody doesn't want taken care of, want taken care
of, realize people tend fall two bins naturally, animals tend fall
bins. Regardless species are, 50/50. again,
sickness behavior motivated state. designed slow circulation blood,
increase circulation lymph, killer cells body, reduce
probability infecting others reducing, thought, diarrhea vomit, also
breathing others, interacting others. cases will activate this, don't
want call regressed state, many people feel somewhat more...
adults, feel childlike ill want

00:42:00 Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines

taken care badly. might learned. might innate.
don't know, sickness behavior interesting couple reasons.
First all, mimics another state described neuroscience literature,
major depression. sick individuals, sick bacterial viral
infection, people major depression, shown robust
increases levels interleukin-6 tumor necrosis factor alpha.
idea now circulating depression involves inflammatory cytokines
active. know illness involves inflammatory cytokines active.
think it, similarity major depression sick
able point us direction interventions help us either prevent illness
move illness quickly. head direction, indeed
case, just want emphasize sickness behavior provides
bridge immune system nervous system. soon see
also healthy behavior, behavior allows us avoid infection, also points


clear bridge nervous system immune system. isn't just
brain body organs, immune system.
true, interacting time. going lead us place
going clear not surprising certain patterns thinking
certain behaviors

00:43:40 Reduced Appetites Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido

can elect take can help enhance immune system function vice versa.
two features sickness behavior definitely worth pointing out. One
theory, reduced appetite, particular appetite protein rich foods
sick, thought attempt, subconscious attempt, organism
reduce amount iron taking in. Now, typically amount iron intake
recommended less men, eight milligrams per day.
women, anywhere 18 27 milligrams per day, depending whether not
pregnant, lactating menstruating, et cetera, ranges can vary. But,
indeed, true iron levels blood go high, like 45 milligrams per day
can toxic system. theory prominent biology literature
health literature reduction appetite actually attempt
reduce iron intake specifically many bacteria forms infection seem
thrive levels iron blood high. don't want see anyone take
extreme suddenly iron deprivation diet order get well.
interesting theory remiss didn't mention, makes good sense.
Iron actually attached hemoglobin red blood cells bloodstream. Normally
can help us quite lot. also muscle, mention that. Iron can
sequestered muscle, iron serves lot important health promoting roles,
reducing appetite thereby reducing iron intake, reduce capacity
certain things, including infections travel certain compartments within body. So,
again, just theory, think many probably familiar not
appetite sick. thing typical people major
depression loss appetite, not always often loss appetite. So, again,
loss appetite sickness behavior, loss appetite major depression,
perhaps not surprisingly one major symptoms sickness behavior major
depression map less onto one another loss libido interest, not just


social interactions, sex reproduction. so, again, think
sickness behavior depression, very, similar. Okay, sickness
behavior major depression certain core features common. need
therefore ask sick influence way think
perceive environment impact appetite, whether not want
cared cared less? Again, people tend diverge two different bins
there,

00:46:45 Vagus-Nerve Stimulation: Fever, Photophobia, Sleepiness

believe not, pathway identified. infection
someplace body, head, sinus infection,
ear infection, also mention many mechanisms can
also consequence wound injury body. back injury slipped
disc guess called herniated disc way hear described.
that, can kind irritable, don't want certain things just want
left alone. Things harder. How? Why? Well, known pathway,
so-called vagus nerve connects body brain, signals particular
brain sites engage category motivational state call sickness behavior.
Many probably heard vagus, V-A-G-U-S, vagus. vagus nerve
extensive nerve pathway, 10th cranial nerve comes back
brainstem, heads body, branches extensively innervate connect
many organs, including lungs, heart, gut, et cetera.
organs able also send neural signals back brain. sometimes hear
vagus route calming down. Unfortunately, less
myth don't know got propagated. lots different pathways
vagus Usually vagal stimulation actually creates arousal alertness, although
multiple pathways, now many studies vagus
various contexts, including sickness behavior. clear vagus nerve
fast pathway infection body signaled brain,
particular location brain called hypothalamus, harbors lot different
types neurons. Neurons, instance, preoptic area increase body
temperature fever, right? one important things increase body
temperature, body's attempt kill off invader many viruses


many bacteria don't survive well elevated heat. function fever. fever
actually functional role. So, biology, like complicated words, call
anything increases body temperature creates fever, pyrogen. Many years
ago, undergraduate years, working pyrogens, injecting something called
lipopolysaccharide belly, gives fever. way
LPS causes inflammation response gut. gut doesn't know
happening. stomach cells don't know happening. just start secreting
IL-6, IL-1, cytokines, killer cells migrate gut.
sometimes get stomach ache don't feel well, flu, something
like it. neural signal, electrical signals get sent hypothalamus.
hypothalamus says, oh, don't know going there, signal
something's going on. just heat body. just start cooking whatever
there. course don't want fever go high can kill brain
cells. within particular range fever functional adaptive response, okay?
taking drugs try lower fever might make feel

try kill off invader. again, don't want fever go high. going

00:53:03 Humoral (Blood-Borne) Factors, & Choroid Change Brain State

Now, really interesting happening got multiple

amount placed system. very, interesting. leads


question every good scientist, two year old health information seeker asks,
why? How? world work? work? Well make
long story shortish, going go depth here, reason works
sympathetic nervous system, so-called stress part nervous
system, not really called that, part nervous system triggers stress
mild stress, severe stress, even panic, causes release adrenaline
epinephrin brain body. normal circumstances,
sort invading infection, body able push back that, resist engaging
stress response. happening behavioral protocol involving
nervous system, 'cause behaviors generated nervous system
course. behavioral protocol people deliberately employing allows
activate sympathetic nervous system, turn allows activate
normal pathways immune system function enhanced. Okay? Now,
reason underscoring common interpretation study
somehow blocks normal immune response, not really happening
here. Yes, reduction inflammatory cytokines increase anti-
inflammatory cytokines, not really thing blocking immune
response. just easily viewed enhancing immune response
combating intruder, case, E. coli. So, parse study little bit
closely. First all, magical pattern breathing? may
recognize so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim, course Dutchman. think
occupation online used listed daredevil, believe not, Wikipedia.
pretty cool occupation. Wim best known activities cold exposure, holds
multiple world records that, swimming icebergs incredible feats,
definitely don't want try unless extremely skilled really know
doing, does, also use breath work. breathing so-
called Wim Hof breathing similar, not exactly same, similar
Tummo breathing, described historically. science physiology

cyclic hyperventilation, just means repeated deep breaths out.
retentions. So, hot seat anyway, might well
demonstrate know looks like. variations this,
respect Wim, respect Tummo practitioners, respect cyclic
hyperventilators everywhere, one general theme it. involves 20 30 deep


inhales exhales mouth, followed exhale one's air
breath hold, retention. point, 15 60 seconds later,
repeating 25 30 breaths. again, breath hold lungs empty.
variations this, laboratory particular study, looks something
like this. Okay, not going whole thing right now, goes something like
this. [Andrew deeply breathing] Okay, assume 30 breaths. can
already feel perspiring little bit. heating up, release
adrenaline. caused breathing pattern, exhaling one's air, no
speaking like doing. [Andrew deeply exhaling] sitting lungs
empty one feels impulse breathe repeating several rounds, two
three even four rounds. Now people will also introduce big inhale
breath hold end find indeed can hold breath much longer
normally able to. trigger breathe normally activated
increases carbon dioxide blood. neurons brain stem
various regions brain, actually, respond carbon dioxide high
trigger reflex breathe. exhale deeply, blow off lot carbon
dioxide don't feel impulse breathe come quite soon. Basically study
looked people cyclic hyperventilation retention, 25 30 breaths,
retention, 25 30 breaths, retention, 25 30 breaths, retention.
So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various
duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,
get sick. Well, just experienced effect adrenaline,
epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,
order keep fighting combating infection. brings us larger theme,
stress combating infection wound not one unique system.
stress system use combat psychological stress.
very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline
epinephrin, actually better able combat infections reduce
inflammation whole feeling lousy response, right? Remember reduced flu-like
symptoms here. pattern breathing actually useful tool. confess,
use pattern breathing anytime initial stages getting sort
bug. feel like running ragged, somehow, whatever reason,
tickle throat, kind sensation nose, like might've
caught bug sort, will pattern breathing.
consistently, gosh, last four years more. Now just anecdotal reports,
find allows indeed either early symptoms disappear, allows
just kind push harder, longer. don't suggest people continue


push exposure infections. Obviously don't want infect people,
want crash suddenly get massive illness sort
stopped breathing. think useful tool. purely behavioral
intervention shown now additional studies way,
enhance function immune system reduce inflammation.
me, one concrete examples zero cost tool bridges activation
nervous system breathing immune system way releasing
adrenaline thereby reducing terrible effects feelings lousiness from,
case, E. coli infection. Now, like focus couple important points
haven't heard discussed broadly elsewhere, hyperventilation
breath retention important. can't simply hyperventilate get effect

shown hyperventilation phase hypoxia, low oxygen
saturation due breath retention, combine increase epinephrin
adrenaline levels. So, 25 30 breaths, retention. 25
30 breaths retention, meaning exhale breath hold, order
get full effect. also want provide critical cautionary note. Don't
anywhere near water driving car. things might seem kind obvious,
obviously off chance black something like that,
disastrous. So, please careful. again, don't try push breath hold.
moment feel impulse breathe, just breathe. seem three
rounds 25 30 breaths

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine
systems, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like nucleus
accumbens, et cetera. reward system associated dopamine
norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological
pathways also specific protocols related mindset. guess simple way frame
say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie
notion can worry sick? discovered new pathway
able activate pathway independent worry stress see illness
occur, able inhibit pathway, block activity neural pathway
prevent psychogenic fever worrying oneself sick. So, able
controlled way. just mention pathway case want look
detail. corticolimbic pathway. So, just orient us, cortex
less outer shell brain. involved thinking sensation perceptions
learning maintenance lot memories stored there. hear
learn remember hippocampus, initial site learning
memory, information, believe not, passed off cortex
stored kind long-term hard drive type storage. corticolimbic pathway one
thoughts, prior experiences can literally structure way, feed
onto areas brain control basal processes, including temperature
regulation. corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway. talked earlier
hypothalamus controlling temperature lot sickness related behavior, right?
Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic
pathway, fancy name. dorsal peduncular cortex, dorsal tinea tecta.
short DP/DTT. just call DP/DTT, dorsomedial
hypothalamus. lot D's. shouldn't mean anything. doesn't really matter
call it. important conceptually pathway originates insights
brain associated thinking, emotion prior history, feeds
directly area brain involved basic physiological subconsciously
controlled processes. So, incredible, right? points physical pathway
way think something changes something core physiology.
Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something
excites you, heart rate can increase. think something terrifies you,
heart rate can increase. idea thinking controls physiology not
new concept all, somehow human beings, challenged idea
actually think sick. paper Kataoka shows
expose somebody psychological stress, can actually activate
pathway create fever. that? Well, can exposing


subjects stressful real event, cue associative learning.
So, maybe, like PILOT V5s, love much, traumatize
PILOT V5 horrible experience happen looking
concentrating PILOT V5. take away horrible experience, give
PILOT V5, start experience lot symptoms associated
terrible event. able using sickness inducing stimuli forth.
various derivations identified pathway activated, even
absence horrible event, create fever illness-like behavior
forth. blocked certain stations along neural pathway, block
effect. really concrete evidence, proof, will, dedicated
pathways mammalian brain, brain mine, allow us turn thoughts
illness.

01:37:00 Tool 8: Healthy Mindsets, Hope, Dopamine; Tool 9: Tyrosine; Tool 10: Cold

kind depressing idea. inverse? turning thoughts
health? Well, work Asya Rolls. explored well-established
psychological phenomenon cancer patients ill people people
suffering debilitating injuries, people reported sense hope,
rates recovery much higher, right? Sounds subjective.
sense hope? sense hope sense future. sense future tightly
associated dopamine system. Dopamine, again, molecule reward
motivation movement, movement motivation things
beyond confines skin future.
discovered studies groups discovered
stimulation dopamine pathway, either simply thinking future, ideally
positive future, thinking positive future leads activation so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway reduce size tumors, accelerate
wound healing, greatly accelerate passage state illness state
health wellbeing. many, many studies now starting wick related
this. also idea augmenting dopamine system can increase
rate healing. so, individuals opt, instance, take
things increase dopamine. Now, obviously drugs abuse not good idea


context, even though increase dopamine, lead big crashes,
addictive properties, et cetera. talked podcast things like L-
tyrosine, taking anywhere 500 750 milligrams can increase dopamine
tyrosine dopamine precursor, course. Things like Mucuna pruriens, L-
dopa, immediate precursor dopamine. will lead somewhat
crash certain individuals. people tolerate little bit better. Again,
talk doctor, figure right you. bipolar
mania schizophrenia, things, not recommend all. not
recommending all, just mentioning potential exploration safe
right you. point this: dopamine system, activated can
accelerate healing, can accelerate recovery injury kinds.
shouldn't come mystery surprise result us. reward pathway
fact related sense future seems liberate entire systems
within body make inflammatory cytokines go down, anti-inflammatory
cytokines go up. Exactly demonstrated beautiful PNAS study
breathing, cyclic hyperventilation, used increase epinephrin, increase
norepinephrine, augment catecholamine system. So, think bridges
studies really relevant. one case, talking potentially
taking over-the-counter compound increase dopamine accelerate healing.
another case, talking using breathing. also use cold water
exposure increase dopamine. talked several episodes ago,
shown immersing oneself cold water neck so. cold? Well,
depends can tolerate, uncomfortably cold, not cold
become hypothermic, challenging get in, can stay three
10 minutes so, shown lead significant, doubling
baseline dopamine levels epinephrin levels go several hours. may
basis people will cold showers ice baths get sauna.
So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment
neurotransmitters. Today, talking neurotransmitters can
used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally
exposure cold water, instance, can done even just simply breathing
particular way, cyclic hyperventilation followed retention. catacholamines,


noradrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine bridge activation immune
system nervous system. way nervous system calls
immune system, "Aha, problem. need counter this." can
think them, meaning dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, able
deploy larger amounts immune cells,

01:42:05 You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis

types immune cells talked beginning episode. Okay,
thus far, discussing one can prevent getting sick one starts
feel ill, one might able shorten course infection ramping
activity immune system. already experiencing
symptoms? runny nose, stuffed nose, congestion, headache, et cetera. Well,
many ways address symptom level. probably aware
counter medications, many focus epinephrin system. Things
Sudafed variety prevent reduce congestion way
cause release epinephrin, effects dilating bronchioles
dilating nasal passages forth. not going speak whether not
good bad choices. couple effects not great
course treating underlying cause, first can cause dehydration.
make sure hydrating well, fluids electrolytes,
also can interfere sleep talked episodes sleep,
one hallmarks deep sleep particular REM sleep epinephrin,
adrenaline levels low. allows intense, often
emotionally-laden dreams REM sleep not act out. low adrenaline,
epinephrin REM sleep basically signature, neurochemical signature
REM sleep state, vital emotional physical repair forth. So,
fact can inhibit sleep, fact can cause dehydration, fact can
make people feel kind lightheaded jittery makes not terrific choices
number people. interesting alternative choice. say alternative,
mean alternative. choice referring spirulina, actually
form algae. Years ago, think first heard spirulina, sounded much
kind 1970s, 80s health food store variety. seemed really kind mystical
wacky, actually now really nice studies data, also


understanding mechanism spirulina can potent effects reducing
called rhinitis, fancy word congestion nose
inflammation nose. Basically, anytime hear word includes "itis," least
medical health context, generally means inflammation tissue.
rhinitis just inflammation nasal passages, one
uncomfortable symptoms kind infection. two studies like
highlight just quickly. One effects spirulina allergic rhinitis.
clinical comparison efficacy spirulina platensis, technical name,
cetirizine treatment allergic rhinitis. looked humans, not
mouse study, study humans. sexes, males females. one
case, looking 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects. other, 65 subjects, decent
number subjects, randomized trial, double blind. cases saw significant decreases
nasal obstruction, improved ability smell, improved sleep, daily working
inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,
region hind brain back brain kind near neck
medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal
prominent "Nature" featuring upfront, think really mark
beginning new path medicine. just underscore point little bit further,
National Institutes Health, course cancer institute, eye institute,
deal trying combat cancer cure blindness forth. now
called NCCIH, complimentary health. so, good tax
dollars put kinds explorations talking undoubtedly
going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times
hope learning new emerging science hearing
protocols either zero cost low cost, certainly respiration
case use heat cold, maybe even electroacupuncture
access that, can really see starting evolve field health

00:28:00 Tool 1: Nasal Microbiome “Scrubbing” Bacteria & Viruses; Nasal Breathing

Well, far know, three main ways that. first two purely

whenever possible, unless eating speaking, want nasal breathing, not

types can protect incoming infection, don't want mouth
breather variety reasons. terrific book called "Jaws: Hidden

Sapolsky. really lot heavy hitters book talks increase
infection one gets breathing mouth, opposed nose. Now,
course, hard exercise, one breathes mouth, not necessarily

breathing nose. Many people trouble breathing nose
so-called deviated septums chronically collapsed sinuses. best way

breather, will combat infections constantly confronted with.
mention always bombarded different types bacteria, viruses,

fermented foods. talked bunch times podcast,
data colleague, Justin Sonnenburg's lab Stanford Med. there, just
wiped eyes. Yep, got me. paper published journal "Cell,"
absolutely spectacular journal, really points fact people eat fermented
foods, two four servings per day, helps reduce activity certain cytokines. Now,
know are, right? Cells make cytokines call out, "help me, help me."
reduce amount cytokines, so-called inflammatom. Now doesn't render

don't wipe eyes, keep hands clean, everyone tells that, right? keep

00:34:56 Sickness Behavior



important point keep mind go forward. Next, like talk
called sickness behavior. indeed category behavior call
sickness behavior informative things can avoid getting
sick. Now, notion sickness behavior goes back several decades more.
interesting way looking function immune system,
bridges us thing calling immune system T-
cells, B-cells, cytokines leukocytes, starts taking us realm
nervous system, course nervous system controls behavior.
sickness behavior suite responses tend undergo
feeling sick. going vary person person, general
categories things happen us wounded
sick dealing infection kind. examining sickness behavior
detail, can really informative routes can take health.
main thing sickness behavior tends involve slowing usual
levels activity. People start feel lethargic, feel like activities
previously relative ease difficult somewhat
overwhelming. thing start see people animals, way,
stop grooming, stop taking care themselves. Not necessarily stopped showering,
although oftentimes case, will stop hair, stop putting
makeup, depending whether not before, might stop. Animals
will stop licking grooming themselves. People will stop taking care cosmetic
appearance. Now not just don't care look sick,
overall suppression certain kinds activities
enhancement kinds activities. really important. Sickness behavior
actually motivated state. state designed accomplish certain things.
One features sickness behavior addition lethargic, loss
grooming, will loss appetite, right? Oftentimes people great appetite
normally just won't feel hungry all. several theories
be. One prominent idea literature discourage vomiting diarrhea,
course can infectious people. So, theory. don't know
ever tested directly, one idea. idea simply
harbor resources sake repair. want talk
told get extra sleep aren't feeling well rest. just like good two


three-year-old constantly asks, "why, why?" Good scientists, good people
interested health information always asking why. get

shouldn't just push this? couple reasons
established literature. first seem something
useful slowing circulation ill. One idea data support
slow circulation, blood circulation, not running around
much running all, rather lying down, getting extra rest, maybe sleeping, maybe
even just remaining still, lymphatic system, carries lot immune-
related cells fluids, able ramp levels activity. So, interesting,
right? reducing circulation blood, increasing circulation lymphatic

combating infection, lymph nodes can get sore. got lymph nodes behind

people, get sick, psychologically go vulnerable state

really want taken care of. Now, think adaptive
perspective, makes sense, right? member species ill

restroom can feel like monumental task. 50% people report describe

non-adaptive response increases opportunity spread
infection caretaker. interesting consideration. Another 50% people
seem opposite response sick. So, somehow, regardless
prior getting ill, sickness behavior engaged neural

right? not stubbornness. literally lack interest disinterest social

ever somebody doesn't want taken care of, want taken care

00:43:40 Reduced Appetites Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido

can elect take can help enhance immune system function vice versa.
two features sickness behavior definitely worth pointing out. One
theory, reduced appetite, particular appetite protein rich foods

reduce amount iron taking in. Now, typically amount iron intake
recommended less men, eight milligrams per day.
women, anywhere 18 27 milligrams per day, depending whether not
pregnant, lactating menstruating, et cetera, ranges can vary. But,
indeed, true iron levels blood go high, like 45 milligrams per day
can toxic system. theory prominent biology literature
health literature reduction appetite actually attempt
reduce iron intake specifically many bacteria forms infection seem
thrive levels iron blood high. don't want see anyone take
extreme suddenly iron deprivation diet order get well.
interesting theory remiss didn't mention, makes good sense.
Iron actually attached hemoglobin red blood cells bloodstream. Normally
can help us quite lot. also muscle, mention that. Iron can
sequestered muscle, iron serves lot important health promoting roles,
reducing appetite thereby reducing iron intake, reduce capacity
certain things, including infections travel certain compartments within body. So,
again, just theory, think many probably familiar not
appetite sick. thing typical people major
depression loss appetite, not always often loss appetite. So, again,
loss appetite sickness behavior, loss appetite major depression,
perhaps not surprisingly one major symptoms sickness behavior major
depression map less onto one another loss libido interest, not just


social interactions, sex reproduction. so, again, think
sickness behavior depression, very, similar. Okay, sickness

looked people cyclic hyperventilation retention, 25 30 breaths,
retention, 25 30 breaths, retention, 25 30 breaths, retention.
So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various
duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,
get sick. Well, just experienced effect adrenaline,
epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,
order keep fighting combating infection. brings us larger theme,
stress combating infection wound not one unique system.
stress system use combat psychological stress.
very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline
epinephrin, actually better able combat infections reduce
inflammation whole feeling lousy response, right? Remember reduced flu-like
symptoms here. pattern breathing actually useful tool. confess,
use pattern breathing anytime initial stages getting sort
bug. feel like running ragged, somehow, whatever reason,
tickle throat, kind sensation nose, like might've
caught bug sort, will pattern breathing.
consistently, gosh, last four years more. Now just anecdotal reports,
find allows indeed either early symptoms disappear, allows
just kind push harder, longer. don't suggest people continue


push exposure infections. Obviously don't want infect people,
want crash suddenly get massive illness sort
stopped breathing. think useful tool. purely behavioral
intervention shown now additional studies way,
enhance function immune system reduce inflammation.
me, one concrete examples zero cost tool bridges activation
nervous system breathing immune system way releasing
adrenaline thereby reducing terrible effects feelings lousiness from,
case, E. coli infection. Now, like focus couple important points
haven't heard discussed broadly elsewhere, hyperventilation
breath retention important. can't simply hyperventilate get effect
level epinephrin release reduction inflammatory cytokines.
shown hyperventilation phase hypoxia, low oxygen
saturation due breath retention, combine increase epinephrin
adrenaline levels. So, 25 30 breaths, retention. 25
30 breaths retention, meaning exhale breath hold, order
get full effect. also want provide critical cautionary note. Don't
anywhere near water driving car. things might seem kind obvious,
obviously off chance black something like that,
disastrous. So, please careful. again, don't try push breath hold.
moment feel impulse breathe, just breathe. seem three
rounds 25 30 breaths

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine
systems, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like nucleus
accumbens, et cetera. reward system associated dopamine
norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological
pathways also specific protocols related mindset. guess simple way frame
say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie
notion can worry sick? discovered new pathway
able activate pathway independent worry stress see illness
occur, able inhibit pathway, block activity neural pathway
prevent psychogenic fever worrying oneself sick. So, able
controlled way. just mention pathway case want look
detail. corticolimbic pathway. So, just orient us, cortex
less outer shell brain. involved thinking sensation perceptions
learning maintenance lot memories stored there. hear
learn remember hippocampus, initial site learning
memory, information, believe not, passed off cortex
stored kind long-term hard drive type storage. corticolimbic pathway one
thoughts, prior experiences can literally structure way, feed
onto areas brain control basal processes, including temperature
regulation. corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway. talked earlier
hypothalamus controlling temperature lot sickness related behavior, right?
Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic
pathway, fancy name. dorsal peduncular cortex, dorsal tinea tecta.
short DP/DTT. just call DP/DTT, dorsomedial
hypothalamus. lot D's. shouldn't mean anything. doesn't really matter
call it. important conceptually pathway originates insights
brain associated thinking, emotion prior history, feeds
directly area brain involved basic physiological subconsciously
controlled processes. So, incredible, right? points physical pathway
way think something changes something core physiology.
Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something
excites you, heart rate can increase. think something terrifies you,
heart rate can increase. idea thinking controls physiology not
new concept all, somehow human beings, challenged idea
actually think sick. paper Kataoka shows
expose somebody psychological stress, can actually activate
pathway create fever. that? Well, can exposing


subjects stressful real event, cue associative learning.
So, maybe, like PILOT V5s, love much, traumatize
PILOT V5 horrible experience happen looking
concentrating PILOT V5. take away horrible experience, give
PILOT V5, start experience lot symptoms associated
terrible event. able using sickness inducing stimuli forth.
various derivations identified pathway activated, even
absence horrible event, create fever illness-like behavior
forth. blocked certain stations along neural pathway, block
effect. really concrete evidence, proof, will, dedicated
pathways mammalian brain, brain mine, allow us turn thoughts
illness.

01:37:00 Tool 8: Healthy Mindsets, Hope, Dopamine; Tool 9: Tyrosine; Tool 10: Cold
Exposure

kind depressing idea. inverse? turning thoughts
health? Well, work Asya Rolls. explored well-established
psychological phenomenon cancer patients ill people people
suffering debilitating injuries, people reported sense hope,
rates recovery much higher, right? Sounds subjective.
sense hope? sense hope sense future. sense future tightly
associated dopamine system. Dopamine, again, molecule reward
motivation movement, movement motivation things
beyond confines skin future.
discovered studies groups discovered
stimulation dopamine pathway, either simply thinking future, ideally
positive future, thinking positive future leads activation so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway reduce size tumors, accelerate
wound healing, greatly accelerate passage state illness state
health wellbeing. many, many studies now starting wick related
this. also idea augmenting dopamine system can increase
rate healing. so, individuals opt, instance, take
things increase dopamine. Now, obviously drugs abuse not good idea


context, even though increase dopamine, lead big crashes,
addictive properties, et cetera. talked podcast things like L-
tyrosine, taking anywhere 500 750 milligrams can increase dopamine
tyrosine dopamine precursor, course. Things like Mucuna pruriens, L-
dopa, immediate precursor dopamine. will lead somewhat
crash certain individuals. people tolerate little bit better. Again,
talk doctor, figure right you. bipolar
mania schizophrenia, things, not recommend all. not
recommending all, just mentioning potential exploration safe
right you. point this: dopamine system, activated can
accelerate healing, can accelerate recovery injury kinds.
shouldn't come mystery surprise result us. reward pathway
fact related sense future seems liberate entire systems
within body make inflammatory cytokines go down, anti-inflammatory
cytokines go up. Exactly demonstrated beautiful PNAS study
breathing, cyclic hyperventilation, used increase epinephrin, increase
norepinephrine, augment catecholamine system. So, think bridges
studies really relevant. one case, talking potentially
taking over-the-counter compound increase dopamine accelerate healing.
another case, talking using breathing. also use cold water
exposure increase dopamine. talked several episodes ago,
shown immersing oneself cold water neck so. cold? Well,
depends can tolerate, uncomfortably cold, not cold
become hypothermic, challenging get in, can stay three
10 minutes so, shown lead significant, doubling
baseline dopamine levels epinephrin levels go several hours. may
basis people will cold showers ice baths get sauna.
So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment
neurotransmitters. Today, talking neurotransmitters can
used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally
exposure cold water, instance, can done even just simply breathing
particular way, cyclic hyperventilation followed retention. catacholamines,


noradrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine bridge activation immune
system nervous system. way nervous system calls
immune system, "Aha, problem. need counter this." can
think them, meaning dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, able
deploy larger amounts immune cells,

01:42:05 You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis

types immune cells talked beginning episode. Okay,
thus far, discussing one can prevent getting sick one starts
feel ill, one might able shorten course infection ramping
activity immune system. already experiencing
symptoms? runny nose, stuffed nose, congestion, headache, et cetera. Well,
many ways address symptom level. probably aware
counter medications, many focus epinephrin system. Things
Sudafed variety prevent reduce congestion way
cause release epinephrin, effects dilating bronchioles
dilating nasal passages forth. not going speak whether not
good bad choices. couple effects not great
course treating underlying cause, first can cause dehydration.
make sure hydrating well, fluids electrolytes,
also can interfere sleep talked episodes sleep,
one hallmarks deep sleep particular REM sleep epinephrin,
adrenaline levels low. allows intense, often
emotionally-laden dreams REM sleep not act out. low adrenaline,
epinephrin REM sleep basically signature, neurochemical signature
REM sleep state, vital emotional physical repair forth. So,
fact can inhibit sleep, fact can cause dehydration, fact can
make people feel kind lightheaded jittery makes not terrific choices
number people. interesting alternative choice. say alternative,
mean alternative. choice referring spirulina, actually
form algae. Years ago, think first heard spirulina, sounded much
kind 1970s, 80s health food store variety. seemed really kind mystical
wacky, actually now really nice studies data, also


understanding mechanism spirulina can potent effects reducing
called rhinitis, fancy word congestion nose
inflammation nose. Basically, anytime hear word includes "itis," least
medical health context, generally means inflammation tissue.
rhinitis just inflammation nasal passages, one
uncomfortable symptoms kind infection. two studies like
highlight just quickly. One effects spirulina allergic rhinitis.
clinical comparison efficacy spirulina platensis, technical name,
cetirizine treatment allergic rhinitis. looked humans, not
mouse study, study humans. sexes, males females. one
case, looking 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects. other, 65 subjects, decent
number subjects, randomized trial, double blind. cases saw significant decreases
nasal obstruction, improved ability smell, improved sleep, daily working
inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,
region hind brain back brain kind near neck
medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal
prominent "Nature" featuring upfront, think really mark
beginning new path medicine. just underscore point little bit further,
National Institutes Health, course cancer institute, eye institute,
deal trying combat cancer cure blindness forth. now
called NCCIH, complimentary health. so, good tax
dollars put kinds explorations talking undoubtedly
going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times
hope learning new emerging science hearing
protocols either zero cost low cost, certainly respiration
case use heat cold, maybe even electroacupuncture
access that, can really see starting evolve field health
medicine science ancient practices, really starting converge

general, reside marrow, least adults. So, bone marrow,
ability make certain cells can go called
chemically, get called sites infection create antibodies,
maintain antibodies system, memory particular infection
infection comes back again, can kill off immediately. doesn't
pass multiple stages first, innate response, adaptive
response, taking time. Now, lot details adaptive immune
system, just want emphasize points might relevant. First all,
name antibodies created sometimes come form IgM IgG,
things sort. isn't full deep dive immunology class, Ig stands
immunoglobulin, okay? immunoglobulins part adaptive immune
response creating antibodies. hear IgM, IgM first adaptive
immune responses, tends come earlier. somebody immunopositive
IgM particular type viral bacterial invader, means fairly
recent infection. Later, one creates... adaptive immune system, say,
creates IgG, stable form specific antibody going
recognize given invader. IgG tends come little bit later. So, just recap,
something gets system eyes, hole skin,
cut, mouth, sexually transmitted diseases come mucus
membranes genitalia genitalia, sexually transmitted disease,
airborne disease, gets mucus, somehow gets bloodstream.
innate response, general response trying contain combat
infection invader. adaptive response one generates
antibodies. First, IgM response, immunoglobulin-M response,
immunoglobulin-G response, IgG response. So, keep three barriers
three defense systems infection tuned up? Well, leaving aside list things
mentioned generally enhances function, things like sleep
sunlight good nutrition, et cetera, sort generic things good health, one
key ways can keep mucus lining really good shape.
mean? Well, mucus lining needs turn quite often needs
correct chemistry trap bad stuff permeable good
stuff, nutrients need. now clear hundreds, not
thousands studies best way maintain healthy so-called
microbiome. microbiome little bacterial organisms good us


live along mucus pathways even eyes. Now, just really clear,
not just gut microbiome; actually microbiome eyes,
one specific mouth, nasal specific microbiome, one
along gut species microbiota live along digestive tract differ
mouth, throat, stomach, intestines, rectum. well-
established healthy microbiota live along length,
differ along length. also urethral microbiota, vaginal
microbiota promotes health environment well. one can
maintain healthy microbiota not favor growth harmful bacteria, allow
mucus lining become permeable bad stuff can come
environment?

00:28:00 Tool 1: Nasal Microbiome “Scrubbing” Bacteria & Viruses; Nasal Breathing

Well, far know, three main ways that. first two purely
structural mechanical. clear now work, done
Stanford, elsewhere well, nasal microbiome particularly good
scrubbing bacteria, preventing certain types infections. So, reminder
whenever possible, unless eating speaking, want nasal breathing, not
breathing mouth. nose much better filter viruses bacteria
mouth. mouth contains certain structural features, even organs cell
types can protect incoming infection, don't want mouth
breather variety reasons. terrific book called "Jaws: Hidden
Epidemic," written colleagues, Sandra Kahn Paul Ehrlich
Stanford, Stanford Medicine foreword Jared Diamond Robert
Sapolsky. really lot heavy hitters book talks increase
infection one gets breathing mouth, opposed nose. Now,
course, hard exercise, one breathes mouth, not necessarily
bad. one eating speaking, not necessarily bad all. guess depends
saying. joke. general, possible want
breathing nose. Many people trouble breathing nose
so-called deviated septums chronically collapsed sinuses. best way
dilate sinuses actually breathe nose. can take little bit
time, plasticity sinuses. so, nose breather, not mouth


breather, will combat infections constantly confronted with.
mention always bombarded different types bacteria, viruses,
parasites environment. goal course, reinforce immune
system, can keep things bay not get sick. actually paper
published Cell Reports, "Cell Press Journal," excellent journal showed
nasal microbiome, particular species microbiota good fighting
off infection. not direct link particular patterns nasal
breathing nasal microbiome yet, oxygenation environment
breathing nose, turns quite important overall enhancing
filter. don't just think nose something

00:30:33 Tools 2 & 3: (Not) Touching Eyes; Gut Microbiome & Fermented Foods

smell foods bring air. also active filter things invade you.
way try keep bad things avoid getting sick advice
mother, certainly mother gave me, not touch eyes
touching people touching surfaces. mentioned earlier, tend
subconsciously. reason avoid eyes primary entry
point lot bacteria viruses. constantly lubricating surface
eyes so-called lacrimal glands, tears things sort. ever
noticed wake morning, sleep eyes, know
kind crusty stuff corners eyes eyelashes, sleep,
crust actually dead bacteria successfully battled night. Okay,
is. not accumulation healthy tissue. accumulation
healthy mucus membranes tears things specifically
combating bacteria. So, know sounds little bit gross, is.
wiping away casualties battle fought night.
daytime, don't want introduce viruses things eyes much
possible. primary site entry. people wear goggles surgical units
things sort, try avoid getting things eyes. Very,
important. third way keep healthy line defense entire mucus
tract enhance proliferation good gut microbiota. best way enhance
quality gut microbiome mucus lining serves protective layer
along body ingest two four servings day fermented foods, low sugar


fermented foods. talked bunch times podcast,
data colleague, Justin Sonnenburg's lab Stanford Med. there, just
wiped eyes. Yep, got me. paper published journal "Cell,"
absolutely spectacular journal, really points fact people eat fermented
foods, two four servings per day, helps reduce activity certain cytokines. Now,
know are, right? Cells make cytokines call out, "help me, help me."
reduce amount cytokines, so-called inflammatom. Now doesn't render
cells vulnerable. reason saw reduction IL-6 IL-1,
cytokines people healthy gut microbiome,
fewer cells body infected outside infections therefore less
reason cells crying out, "help," thriving, not suffering. So,
don't wipe eyes, keep hands clean, everyone tells that, right? keep
hands clean, don't wipe eyes, nasal breather, not mouth breather,
unless speaking, exercising eating, keep healthy gut microbiome
eating two four servings day quality, low sugar, fermented foods, things like
sauerkraut, things like natto can access that. tried before, interesting.
sort acquired taste, kimchi, pickles, again, low sugar sources going
sources going effective this. now armed three ways
enhance function immune system combat infection is, like
think separate typical type information get get good sleep,
good nutrition, good social connection, et cetera. stuff still holds true,
three points think can really make

00:34:20 Interleukins Anti-Inflammatory

substantial difference terms bolstering immune system, immune system.
want mention, names going come several times
episode, interleukins like IL-6 IL-1 encourage inflammation,
"help me" signals call cells gobble invaders.
interleukins anti-inflammatory. one like highlight particular,
will come little bit interleukin-10. not IL, insert
number, not interleukins inflammatory, anti-inflammatory.

00:34:56 Sickness Behavior



important point keep mind go forward. Next, like talk
called sickness behavior. indeed category behavior call
sickness behavior informative things can avoid getting
sick. Now, notion sickness behavior goes back several decades more.
interesting way looking function immune system,
bridges us thing calling immune system T-
cells, B-cells, cytokines leukocytes, starts taking us realm
nervous system, course nervous system controls behavior.
sickness behavior suite responses tend undergo
feeling sick. going vary person person, general
categories things happen us wounded
sick dealing infection kind. examining sickness behavior
detail, can really informative routes can take health.
main thing sickness behavior tends involve slowing usual
levels activity. People start feel lethargic, feel like activities
previously relative ease difficult somewhat
overwhelming. thing start see people animals, way,
stop grooming, stop taking care themselves. Not necessarily stopped showering,
although oftentimes case, will stop hair, stop putting
makeup, depending whether not before, might stop. Animals
will stop licking grooming themselves. People will stop taking care cosmetic
appearance. Now not just don't care look sick,
overall suppression certain kinds activities
enhancement kinds activities. really important. Sickness behavior
actually motivated state. state designed accomplish certain things.
One features sickness behavior addition lethargic, loss
grooming, will loss appetite, right? Oftentimes people great appetite
normally just won't feel hungry all. several theories
be. One prominent idea literature discourage vomiting diarrhea,
course can infectious people. So, theory. don't know
ever tested directly, one idea. idea simply
harbor resources sake repair. want talk
told get extra sleep aren't feeling well rest. just like good two


three-year-old constantly asks, "why, why?" Good scientists, good people
interested health information always asking why. get
sleep? happens sleep get sleep sick?
shouldn't just push this? couple reasons
established literature. first seem something
useful slowing circulation ill. One idea data support
slow circulation, blood circulation, not running around
much running all, rather lying down, getting extra rest, maybe sleeping, maybe
even just remaining still, lymphatic system, carries lot immune-
related cells fluids, able ramp levels activity. So, interesting,
right? reducing circulation blood, increasing circulation lymphatic
system. probably familiar lymphatic system
combating infection, lymph nodes can get sore. got lymph nodes behind
ears, groin, armpits, around throat,

00:39:08 People Seek Care Sick, Others Want Alone

around near thyroid, throat, et cetera. So, reason. Now,
people, get sick, psychologically go vulnerable state
really, really want people, people take care them. probably
witnessed this, feel way yourself. 50% people response.
really want taken care of. Now, think adaptive
perspective, makes sense, right? member species ill
less will cry help one form another members species
take care them. course will especially apparent cases people
young enough incapacitated enough can't actually get resources
own. ever really sick, just getting going fridge
restroom can feel like monumental task. 50% people report describe
seeking help support sick. also imagine
non-adaptive response increases opportunity spread
infection caretaker. interesting consideration. Another 50% people
seem opposite response sick. So, somehow, regardless
prior getting ill, sickness behavior engaged neural

going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction

inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not

effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,
region hind brain back brain kind near neck
medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal
prominent "Nature" featuring upfront, think really mark
beginning new path medicine. just underscore point little bit further,
National Institutes Health, course cancer institute, eye institute,

going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times
hope learning new emerging science hearing

live along mucus pathways even eyes. Now, just really clear,
not just gut microbiome; actually microbiome eyes,
one specific mouth, nasal specific microbiome, one

established healthy microbiota live along length,

00:28:00 Tool 1: Nasal Microbiome “Scrubbing” Bacteria & Viruses; Nasal Breathing

Well, far know, three main ways that. first two purely
structural mechanical. clear now work, done
Stanford, elsewhere well, nasal microbiome particularly good
scrubbing bacteria, preventing certain types infections. So, reminder
whenever possible, unless eating speaking, want nasal breathing, not
breathing mouth. nose much better filter viruses bacteria
mouth. mouth contains certain structural features, even organs cell
types can protect incoming infection, don't want mouth
breather variety reasons. terrific book called "Jaws: Hidden
Epidemic," written colleagues, Sandra Kahn Paul Ehrlich
Stanford, Stanford Medicine foreword Jared Diamond Robert
Sapolsky. really lot heavy hitters book talks increase
infection one gets breathing mouth, opposed nose. Now,
course, hard exercise, one breathes mouth, not necessarily
bad. one eating speaking, not necessarily bad all. guess depends
saying. joke. general, possible want
breathing nose. Many people trouble breathing nose
so-called deviated septums chronically collapsed sinuses. best way
dilate sinuses actually breathe nose. can take little bit
time, plasticity sinuses. so, nose breather, not mouth


breather, will combat infections constantly confronted with.
mention always bombarded different types bacteria, viruses,
parasites environment. goal course, reinforce immune
system, can keep things bay not get sick. actually paper
published Cell Reports, "Cell Press Journal," excellent journal showed
nasal microbiome, particular species microbiota good fighting
off infection. not direct link particular patterns nasal
breathing nasal microbiome yet, oxygenation environment
breathing nose, turns quite important overall enhancing
filter. don't just think nose something

00:30:33 Tools 2 & 3: (Not) Touching Eyes; Gut Microbiome & Fermented Foods

smell foods bring air. also active filter things invade you.
way try keep bad things avoid getting sick advice
mother, certainly mother gave me, not touch eyes
touching people touching surfaces. mentioned earlier, tend
subconsciously. reason avoid eyes primary entry
point lot bacteria viruses. constantly lubricating surface
eyes so-called lacrimal glands, tears things sort. ever
noticed wake morning, sleep eyes, know
kind crusty stuff corners eyes eyelashes, sleep,
crust actually dead bacteria successfully battled night. Okay,
is. not accumulation healthy tissue. accumulation
healthy mucus membranes tears things specifically
combating bacteria. So, know sounds little bit gross, is.
wiping away casualties battle fought night.
daytime, don't want introduce viruses things eyes much
possible. primary site entry. people wear goggles surgical units
things sort, try avoid getting things eyes. Very,
important. third way keep healthy line defense entire mucus
tract enhance proliferation good gut microbiota. best way enhance
quality gut microbiome mucus lining serves protective layer
along body ingest two four servings day fermented foods, low sugar


fermented foods. talked bunch times podcast,
data colleague, Justin Sonnenburg's lab Stanford Med. there, just
wiped eyes. Yep, got me. paper published journal "Cell,"
absolutely spectacular journal, really points fact people eat fermented
foods, two four servings per day, helps reduce activity certain cytokines. Now,
know are, right? Cells make cytokines call out, "help me, help me."
reduce amount cytokines, so-called inflammatom. Now doesn't render
cells vulnerable. reason saw reduction IL-6 IL-1,
cytokines people healthy gut microbiome,
fewer cells body infected outside infections therefore less
reason cells crying out, "help," thriving, not suffering. So,
don't wipe eyes, keep hands clean, everyone tells that, right? keep
hands clean, don't wipe eyes, nasal breather, not mouth breather,
unless speaking, exercising eating, keep healthy gut microbiome
eating two four servings day quality, low sugar, fermented foods, things like
sauerkraut, things like natto can access that. tried before, interesting.
sort acquired taste, kimchi, pickles, again, low sugar sources going
sources going effective this. now armed three ways
enhance function immune system combat infection is, like
think separate typical type information get get good sleep,
good nutrition, good social connection, et cetera. stuff still holds true,
three points think can really make

00:34:20 Interleukins Anti-Inflammatory

substantial difference terms bolstering immune system, immune system.
want mention, names going come several times
episode, interleukins like IL-6 IL-1 encourage inflammation,
"help me" signals call cells gobble invaders.
interleukins anti-inflammatory. one like highlight particular,
will come little bit interleukin-10. not IL, insert
number, not interleukins inflammatory, anti-inflammatory.

00:34:56 Sickness Behavior



important point keep mind go forward. Next, like talk
called sickness behavior. indeed category behavior call
sickness behavior informative things can avoid getting
sick. Now, notion sickness behavior goes back several decades more.
interesting way looking function immune system,
bridges us thing calling immune system T-
cells, B-cells, cytokines leukocytes, starts taking us realm
nervous system, course nervous system controls behavior.
sickness behavior suite responses tend undergo
feeling sick. going vary person person, general
categories things happen us wounded
sick dealing infection kind. examining sickness behavior
detail, can really informative routes can take health.
main thing sickness behavior tends involve slowing usual
levels activity. People start feel lethargic, feel like activities
previously relative ease difficult somewhat
overwhelming. thing start see people animals, way,
stop grooming, stop taking care themselves. Not necessarily stopped showering,
although oftentimes case, will stop hair, stop putting
makeup, depending whether not before, might stop. Animals
will stop licking grooming themselves. People will stop taking care cosmetic
appearance. Now not just don't care look sick,
overall suppression certain kinds activities
enhancement kinds activities. really important. Sickness behavior
actually motivated state. state designed accomplish certain things.
One features sickness behavior addition lethargic, loss
grooming, will loss appetite, right? Oftentimes people great appetite
normally just won't feel hungry all. several theories
be. One prominent idea literature discourage vomiting diarrhea,
course can infectious people. So, theory. don't know
ever tested directly, one idea. idea simply
harbor resources sake repair. want talk
told get extra sleep aren't feeling well rest. just like good two


three-year-old constantly asks, "why, why?" Good scientists, good people
interested health information always asking why. get
sleep? happens sleep get sleep sick?
shouldn't just push this? couple reasons
established literature. first seem something
useful slowing circulation ill. One idea data support
slow circulation, blood circulation, not running around
much running all, rather lying down, getting extra rest, maybe sleeping, maybe
even just remaining still, lymphatic system, carries lot immune-
related cells fluids, able ramp levels activity. So, interesting,
right? reducing circulation blood, increasing circulation lymphatic
system. probably familiar lymphatic system
combating infection, lymph nodes can get sore. got lymph nodes behind
ears, groin, armpits, around throat,

00:39:08 People Seek Care Sick, Others Want Alone

around near thyroid, throat, et cetera. So, reason. Now,
people, get sick, psychologically go vulnerable state
really, really want people, people take care them. probably
witnessed this, feel way yourself. 50% people response.
really want taken care of. Now, think adaptive
perspective, makes sense, right? member species ill
less will cry help one form another members species
take care them. course will especially apparent cases people
young enough incapacitated enough can't actually get resources
own. ever really sick, just getting going fridge
restroom can feel like monumental task. 50% people report describe
seeking help support sick. also imagine
non-adaptive response increases opportunity spread
infection caretaker. interesting consideration. Another 50% people
seem opposite response sick. So, somehow, regardless
prior getting ill, sickness behavior engaged neural
circuits brain, indeed neural circuits brain, create stay away


me. don't want bothered. want left alone. don't want taken care of,
right? not stubbornness. literally lack interest disinterest social
connection one sick. see animals too, animals will seek
members species. Others, like unfortunately now passed away
bulldog, Costello. sick always knew go around
back house just hide there. just take away
everybody else. not want taken care of. just natural response
him. don't think trying prevent getting whatever had.
ever somebody doesn't want taken care of, want taken care
of, realize people tend fall two bins naturally, animals tend fall
bins. Regardless species are, 50/50. again,
sickness behavior motivated state. designed slow circulation blood,
increase circulation lymph, killer cells body, reduce
probability infecting others reducing, thought, diarrhea vomit, also
breathing others, interacting others. cases will activate this, don't
want call regressed state, many people feel somewhat more...
adults, feel childlike ill want

00:42:00 Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines

taken care badly. might learned. might innate.
don't know, sickness behavior interesting couple reasons.
First all, mimics another state described neuroscience literature,
major depression. sick individuals, sick bacterial viral
infection, people major depression, shown robust
increases levels interleukin-6 tumor necrosis factor alpha.
idea now circulating depression involves inflammatory cytokines
active. know illness involves inflammatory cytokines active.
think it, similarity major depression sick
able point us direction interventions help us either prevent illness
move illness quickly. head direction, indeed
case, just want emphasize sickness behavior provides
bridge immune system nervous system. soon see
also healthy behavior, behavior allows us avoid infection, also points


clear bridge nervous system immune system. isn't just
brain body organs, immune system.
true, interacting time. going lead us place
going clear not surprising certain patterns thinking
certain behaviors

00:43:40 Reduced Appetites Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido

can elect take can help enhance immune system function vice versa.
two features sickness behavior definitely worth pointing out. One
theory, reduced appetite, particular appetite protein rich foods
sick, thought attempt, subconscious attempt, organism
reduce amount iron taking in. Now, typically amount iron intake
recommended less men, eight milligrams per day.
women, anywhere 18 27 milligrams per day, depending whether not
pregnant, lactating menstruating, et cetera, ranges can vary. But,
indeed, true iron levels blood go high, like 45 milligrams per day
can toxic system. theory prominent biology literature
health literature reduction appetite actually attempt
reduce iron intake specifically many bacteria forms infection seem
thrive levels iron blood high. don't want see anyone take
extreme suddenly iron deprivation diet order get well.
interesting theory remiss didn't mention, makes good sense.
Iron actually attached hemoglobin red blood cells bloodstream. Normally
can help us quite lot. also muscle, mention that. Iron can
sequestered muscle, iron serves lot important health promoting roles,
reducing appetite thereby reducing iron intake, reduce capacity
certain things, including infections travel certain compartments within body. So,
again, just theory, think many probably familiar not
appetite sick. thing typical people major
depression loss appetite, not always often loss appetite. So, again,
loss appetite sickness behavior, loss appetite major depression,
perhaps not surprisingly one major symptoms sickness behavior major
depression map less onto one another loss libido interest, not just


social interactions, sex reproduction. so, again, think
sickness behavior depression, very, similar. Okay, sickness
behavior major depression certain core features common. need
therefore ask sick influence way think
perceive environment impact appetite, whether not want
cared cared less? Again, people tend diverge two different bins
there,

00:46:45 Vagus-Nerve Stimulation: Fever, Photophobia, Sleepiness

believe not, pathway identified. infection
someplace body, head, sinus infection,
ear infection, also mention many mechanisms can
also consequence wound injury body. back injury slipped
disc guess called herniated disc way hear described.
that, can kind irritable, don't want certain things just want
left alone. Things harder. How? Why? Well, known pathway,
so-called vagus nerve connects body brain, signals particular
brain sites engage category motivational state call sickness behavior.
Many probably heard vagus, V-A-G-U-S, vagus. vagus nerve
extensive nerve pathway, 10th cranial nerve comes back
brainstem, heads body, branches extensively innervate connect
many organs, including lungs, heart, gut, et cetera.
organs able also send neural signals back brain. sometimes hear
vagus route calming down. Unfortunately, less
myth don't know got propagated. lots different pathways
vagus Usually vagal stimulation actually creates arousal alertness, although
multiple pathways, now many studies vagus
various contexts, including sickness behavior. clear vagus nerve
fast pathway infection body signaled brain,
particular location brain called hypothalamus, harbors lot different
types neurons. Neurons, instance, preoptic area increase body
temperature fever, right? one important things increase body
temperature, body's attempt kill off invader many viruses


many bacteria don't survive well elevated heat. function fever. fever
actually functional role. So, biology, like complicated words, call
anything increases body temperature creates fever, pyrogen. Many years
ago, undergraduate years, working pyrogens, injecting something called
lipopolysaccharide belly, gives fever. way
LPS causes inflammation response gut. gut doesn't know
happening. stomach cells don't know happening. just start secreting
IL-6, IL-1, cytokines, killer cells migrate gut.
sometimes get stomach ache don't feel well, flu, something
like it. neural signal, electrical signals get sent hypothalamus.
hypothalamus says, oh, don't know going there, signal
something's going on. just heat body. just start cooking whatever
there. course don't want fever go high can kill brain
cells. within particular range fever functional adaptive response, okay?
taking drugs try lower fever might make feel
comfortable, actually limiting response body creating order
try kill off invader. again, don't want fever go high. going

00:53:03 Humoral (Blood-Borne) Factors, & Choroid Change Brain State

Now, really interesting happening got multiple

couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard

case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal

going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times
hope learning new emerging science hearing

fermented foods. talked bunch times podcast,
data colleague, Justin Sonnenburg's lab Stanford Med. there, just
wiped eyes. Yep, got me. paper published journal "Cell,"
absolutely spectacular journal, really points fact people eat fermented
foods, two four servings per day, helps reduce activity certain cytokines. Now,
know are, right? Cells make cytokines call out, "help me, help me."
reduce amount cytokines, so-called inflammatom. Now doesn't render
cells vulnerable. reason saw reduction IL-6 IL-1,
cytokines people healthy gut microbiome,
fewer cells body infected outside infections therefore less
reason cells crying out, "help," thriving, not suffering. So,
don't wipe eyes, keep hands clean, everyone tells that, right? keep
hands clean, don't wipe eyes, nasal breather, not mouth breather,
unless speaking, exercising eating, keep healthy gut microbiome
eating two four servings day quality, low sugar, fermented foods, things like
sauerkraut, things like natto can access that. tried before, interesting.
sort acquired taste, kimchi, pickles, again, low sugar sources going
sources going effective this. now armed three ways
enhance function immune system combat infection is, like
think separate typical type information get get good sleep,
good nutrition, good social connection, et cetera. stuff still holds true,
three points think can really make

00:34:20 Interleukins Anti-Inflammatory

substantial difference terms bolstering immune system, immune system.
want mention, names going come several times
episode, interleukins like IL-6 IL-1 encourage inflammation,
"help me" signals call cells gobble invaders.
interleukins anti-inflammatory. one like highlight particular,
will come little bit interleukin-10. not IL, insert
number, not interleukins inflammatory, anti-inflammatory.

00:34:56 Sickness Behavior



important point keep mind go forward. Next, like talk
called sickness behavior. indeed category behavior call
sickness behavior informative things can avoid getting
sick. Now, notion sickness behavior goes back several decades more.
interesting way looking function immune system,
bridges us thing calling immune system T-
cells, B-cells, cytokines leukocytes, starts taking us realm
nervous system, course nervous system controls behavior.
sickness behavior suite responses tend undergo
feeling sick. going vary person person, general
categories things happen us wounded
sick dealing infection kind. examining sickness behavior
detail, can really informative routes can take health.
main thing sickness behavior tends involve slowing usual
levels activity. People start feel lethargic, feel like activities
previously relative ease difficult somewhat
overwhelming. thing start see people animals, way,
stop grooming, stop taking care themselves. Not necessarily stopped showering,
although oftentimes case, will stop hair, stop putting
makeup, depending whether not before, might stop. Animals
will stop licking grooming themselves. People will stop taking care cosmetic
appearance. Now not just don't care look sick,
overall suppression certain kinds activities
enhancement kinds activities. really important. Sickness behavior
actually motivated state. state designed accomplish certain things.
One features sickness behavior addition lethargic, loss
grooming, will loss appetite, right? Oftentimes people great appetite
normally just won't feel hungry all. several theories
be. One prominent idea literature discourage vomiting diarrhea,
course can infectious people. So, theory. don't know
ever tested directly, one idea. idea simply
harbor resources sake repair. want talk
told get extra sleep aren't feeling well rest. just like good two


three-year-old constantly asks, "why, why?" Good scientists, good people
interested health information always asking why. get
sleep? happens sleep get sleep sick?
shouldn't just push this? couple reasons
established literature. first seem something
useful slowing circulation ill. One idea data support
slow circulation, blood circulation, not running around
much running all, rather lying down, getting extra rest, maybe sleeping, maybe
even just remaining still, lymphatic system, carries lot immune-
related cells fluids, able ramp levels activity. So, interesting,
right? reducing circulation blood, increasing circulation lymphatic
system. probably familiar lymphatic system
combating infection, lymph nodes can get sore. got lymph nodes behind
ears, groin, armpits, around throat,

00:39:08 People Seek Care Sick, Others Want Alone

around near thyroid, throat, et cetera. So, reason. Now,
people, get sick, psychologically go vulnerable state
really, really want people, people take care them. probably
witnessed this, feel way yourself. 50% people response.
really want taken care of. Now, think adaptive
perspective, makes sense, right? member species ill
less will cry help one form another members species
take care them. course will especially apparent cases people
young enough incapacitated enough can't actually get resources
own. ever really sick, just getting going fridge
restroom can feel like monumental task. 50% people report describe
seeking help support sick. also imagine
non-adaptive response increases opportunity spread
infection caretaker. interesting consideration. Another 50% people
seem opposite response sick. So, somehow, regardless
prior getting ill, sickness behavior engaged neural
circuits brain, indeed neural circuits brain, create stay away


me. don't want bothered. want left alone. don't want taken care of,
right? not stubbornness. literally lack interest disinterest social
connection one sick. see animals too, animals will seek
members species. Others, like unfortunately now passed away
bulldog, Costello. sick always knew go around
back house just hide there. just take away
everybody else. not want taken care of. just natural response
him. don't think trying prevent getting whatever had.
ever somebody doesn't want taken care of, want taken care
of, realize people tend fall two bins naturally, animals tend fall
bins. Regardless species are, 50/50. again,
sickness behavior motivated state. designed slow circulation blood,
increase circulation lymph, killer cells body, reduce
probability infecting others reducing, thought, diarrhea vomit, also
breathing others, interacting others. cases will activate this, don't
want call regressed state, many people feel somewhat more...
adults, feel childlike ill want

00:42:00 Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines

taken care badly. might learned. might innate.
don't know, sickness behavior interesting couple reasons.
First all, mimics another state described neuroscience literature,
major depression. sick individuals, sick bacterial viral
infection, people major depression, shown robust
increases levels interleukin-6 tumor necrosis factor alpha.
idea now circulating depression involves inflammatory cytokines
active. know illness involves inflammatory cytokines active.
think it, similarity major depression sick
able point us direction interventions help us either prevent illness
move illness quickly. head direction, indeed
case, just want emphasize sickness behavior provides
bridge immune system nervous system. soon see
also healthy behavior, behavior allows us avoid infection, also points


clear bridge nervous system immune system. isn't just
brain body organs, immune system.
true, interacting time. going lead us place
going clear not surprising certain patterns thinking
certain behaviors

00:43:40 Reduced Appetites Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido

can elect take can help enhance immune system function vice versa.
two features sickness behavior definitely worth pointing out. One
theory, reduced appetite, particular appetite protein rich foods
sick, thought attempt, subconscious attempt, organism
reduce amount iron taking in. Now, typically amount iron intake
recommended less men, eight milligrams per day.
women, anywhere 18 27 milligrams per day, depending whether not
pregnant, lactating menstruating, et cetera, ranges can vary. But,
indeed, true iron levels blood go high, like 45 milligrams per day
can toxic system. theory prominent biology literature
health literature reduction appetite actually attempt
reduce iron intake specifically many bacteria forms infection seem
thrive levels iron blood high. don't want see anyone take
extreme suddenly iron deprivation diet order get well.
interesting theory remiss didn't mention, makes good sense.
Iron actually attached hemoglobin red blood cells bloodstream. Normally
can help us quite lot. also muscle, mention that. Iron can
sequestered muscle, iron serves lot important health promoting roles,
reducing appetite thereby reducing iron intake, reduce capacity
certain things, including infections travel certain compartments within body. So,
again, just theory, think many probably familiar not
appetite sick. thing typical people major
depression loss appetite, not always often loss appetite. So, again,
loss appetite sickness behavior, loss appetite major depression,
perhaps not surprisingly one major symptoms sickness behavior major
depression map less onto one another loss libido interest, not just


social interactions, sex reproduction. so, again, think
sickness behavior depression, very, similar. Okay, sickness
behavior major depression certain core features common. need
therefore ask sick influence way think
perceive environment impact appetite, whether not want
cared cared less? Again, people tend diverge two different bins
there,

that, can kind irritable, don't want certain things just want

so-called vagus nerve connects body brain, signals particular
brain sites engage category motivational state call sickness behavior.
Many probably heard vagus, V-A-G-U-S, vagus. vagus nerve
extensive nerve pathway, 10th cranial nerve comes back

vagus Usually vagal stimulation actually creates arousal alertness, although
multiple pathways, now many studies vagus

many bacteria don't survive well elevated heat. function fever. fever
actually functional role. So, biology, like complicated words, call
anything increases body temperature creates fever, pyrogen. Many years
ago, undergraduate years, working pyrogens, injecting something called
lipopolysaccharide belly, gives fever. way
LPS causes inflammation response gut. gut doesn't know

IL-6, IL-1, cytokines, killer cells migrate gut.
sometimes get stomach ache don't feel well, flu, something
like it. neural signal, electrical signals get sent hypothalamus.
hypothalamus says, oh, don't know going there, signal
something's going on. just heat body. just start cooking whatever

taking drugs try lower fever might make feel

try kill off invader. again, don't want fever go high. going

behavioral protocol can best described cyclic hyperventilation. lab works
types breathing protocols. not work lab did, basically
subjects hyperventilate, followed breath retention, breath holds, explain
exactly did. also looked forms behavioral protocols,
focus one. So, comparing controls just sort basic meditation
versus people intense breathing followed breath holds. just
paraphrasing here, intervention group, breathing group, plasma levels anti-
inflammatory cytokine IL-10, cytokine lowers inflammation, increased
endotoxin administration. triggered increase epinephrin
adrenaline. So, words, particular pattern breathing allowed anti-
inflammatory cytokine turned on, whereas not case subjects
not particular breathing protocol. discovered levels

inflammatory went up. Finally, flu-like symptoms lower intervention group.
amazing finding, right? human subjects. One group subjects
breathing protocol. group subjects just meditating. sets
subjects injected E. coli. So, know everyone's getting
amount placed system. very, interesting. leads


question every good scientist, two year old health information seeker asks,
why? How? world work? work? Well make
long story shortish, going go depth here, reason works
sympathetic nervous system, so-called stress part nervous
system, not really called that, part nervous system triggers stress
mild stress, severe stress, even panic, causes release adrenaline
epinephrin brain body. normal circumstances,
sort invading infection, body able push back that, resist engaging
stress response. happening behavioral protocol involving
nervous system, 'cause behaviors generated nervous system
course. behavioral protocol people deliberately employing allows
activate sympathetic nervous system, turn allows activate
normal pathways immune system function enhanced. Okay? Now,
reason underscoring common interpretation study
somehow blocks normal immune response, not really happening
here. Yes, reduction inflammatory cytokines increase anti-
inflammatory cytokines, not really thing blocking immune
response. just easily viewed enhancing immune response
combating intruder, case, E. coli. So, parse study little bit
closely. First all, magical pattern breathing? may
recognize so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim, course Dutchman. think
occupation online used listed daredevil, believe not, Wikipedia.
pretty cool occupation. Wim best known activities cold exposure, holds
multiple world records that, swimming icebergs incredible feats,
definitely don't want try unless extremely skilled really know
doing, does, also use breath work. breathing so-
called Wim Hof breathing similar, not exactly same, similar
Tummo breathing, described historically. science physiology
community laboratory, 'cause run university laboratory, refer
cyclic hyperventilation, just means repeated deep breaths out.
retentions. So, hot seat anyway, might well
demonstrate know looks like. variations this,
respect Wim, respect Tummo practitioners, respect cyclic
hyperventilators everywhere, one general theme it. involves 20 30 deep


inhales exhales mouth, followed exhale one's air
breath hold, retention. point, 15 60 seconds later,
repeating 25 30 breaths. again, breath hold lungs empty.
variations this, laboratory particular study, looks something
like this. Okay, not going whole thing right now, goes something like
this. [Andrew deeply breathing] Okay, assume 30 breaths. can
already feel perspiring little bit. heating up, release
adrenaline. caused breathing pattern, exhaling one's air, no
speaking like doing. [Andrew deeply exhaling] sitting lungs
empty one feels impulse breathe repeating several rounds, two
three even four rounds. Now people will also introduce big inhale
breath hold end find indeed can hold breath much longer
normally able to. trigger breathe normally activated
increases carbon dioxide blood. neurons brain stem
various regions brain, actually, respond carbon dioxide high
trigger reflex breathe. exhale deeply, blow off lot carbon
dioxide don't feel impulse breathe come quite soon. Basically study
looked people cyclic hyperventilation retention, 25 30 breaths,
retention, 25 30 breaths, retention, 25 30 breaths, retention.
So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various
duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,
get sick. Well, just experienced effect adrenaline,
epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,
order keep fighting combating infection. brings us larger theme,
stress combating infection wound not one unique system.
stress system use combat psychological stress.
very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline
epinephrin, actually better able combat infections reduce
inflammation whole feeling lousy response, right? Remember reduced flu-like
symptoms here. pattern breathing actually useful tool. confess,
use pattern breathing anytime initial stages getting sort
bug. feel like running ragged, somehow, whatever reason,
tickle throat, kind sensation nose, like might've
caught bug sort, will pattern breathing.
consistently, gosh, last four years more. Now just anecdotal reports,
find allows indeed either early symptoms disappear, allows

push exposure infections. Obviously don't want infect people,
want crash suddenly get massive illness sort

me, one concrete examples zero cost tool bridges activation

30 breaths retention, meaning exhale breath hold, order
get full effect. also want provide critical cautionary note. Don't
anywhere near water driving car. things might seem kind obvious,
obviously off chance black something like that,
disastrous. So, please careful. again, don't try push breath hold.

rounds 25 30 breaths

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine
systems, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like nucleus
accumbens, et cetera. reward system associated dopamine
norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological
pathways also specific protocols related mindset. guess simple way frame
say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie
notion can worry sick? discovered new pathway
able activate pathway independent worry stress see illness
occur, able inhibit pathway, block activity neural pathway
prevent psychogenic fever worrying oneself sick. So, able
controlled way. just mention pathway case want look
detail. corticolimbic pathway. So, just orient us, cortex

stored kind long-term hard drive type storage. corticolimbic pathway one
thoughts, prior experiences can literally structure way, feed
onto areas brain control basal processes, including temperature
regulation. corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway. talked earlier
hypothalamus controlling temperature lot sickness related behavior, right?
Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic
pathway, fancy name. dorsal peduncular cortex, dorsal tinea tecta.

call it. important conceptually pathway originates insights
brain associated thinking, emotion prior history, feeds
directly area brain involved basic physiological subconsciously

way think something changes something core physiology.
Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something

heart rate can increase. idea thinking controls physiology not
new concept all, somehow human beings, challenged idea
actually think sick. paper Kataoka shows
expose somebody psychological stress, can actually activate

subjects stressful real event, cue associative learning.
So, maybe, like PILOT V5s, love much, traumatize
PILOT V5 horrible experience happen looking

PILOT V5, start experience lot symptoms associated

things increase dopamine. Now, obviously drugs abuse not good idea


context, even though increase dopamine, lead big crashes,
addictive properties, et cetera. talked podcast things like L-
tyrosine, taking anywhere 500 750 milligrams can increase dopamine
tyrosine dopamine precursor, course. Things like Mucuna pruriens, L-

fact related sense future seems liberate entire systems
within body make inflammatory cytokines go down, anti-inflammatory
cytokines go up. Exactly demonstrated beautiful PNAS study
breathing, cyclic hyperventilation, used increase epinephrin, increase
norepinephrine, augment catecholamine system. So, think bridges
studies really relevant. one case, talking potentially
taking over-the-counter compound increase dopamine accelerate healing.
another case, talking using breathing. also use cold water
exposure increase dopamine. talked several episodes ago,
shown immersing oneself cold water neck so. cold? Well,
depends can tolerate, uncomfortably cold, not cold
become hypothermic, challenging get in, can stay three
10 minutes so, shown lead significant, doubling
baseline dopamine levels epinephrin levels go several hours. may
basis people will cold showers ice baths get sauna.
So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment
neurotransmitters. Today, talking neurotransmitters can
used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally
exposure cold water, instance, can done even just simply breathing
particular way, cyclic hyperventilation followed retention. catacholamines,


noradrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine bridge activation immune

think them, meaning dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, able
deploy larger amounts immune cells,

01:42:05 You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis

types immune cells talked beginning episode. Okay,
thus far, discussing one can prevent getting sick one starts
feel ill, one might able shorten course infection ramping
activity immune system. already experiencing
symptoms? runny nose, stuffed nose, congestion, headache, et cetera. Well,
many ways address symptom level. probably aware

fact can inhibit sleep, fact can cause dehydration, fact can
make people feel kind lightheaded jittery makes not terrific choices
number people. interesting alternative choice. say alternative,
mean alternative. choice referring spirulina, actually
form algae. Years ago, think first heard spirulina, sounded much
kind 1970s, 80s health food store variety. seemed really kind mystical
wacky, actually now really nice studies data, also


understanding mechanism spirulina can potent effects reducing
called rhinitis, fancy word congestion nose
inflammation nose. Basically, anytime hear word includes "itis," least
medical health context, generally means inflammation tissue.
rhinitis just inflammation nasal passages, one
uncomfortable symptoms kind infection. two studies like
highlight just quickly. One effects spirulina allergic rhinitis.
clinical comparison efficacy spirulina platensis, technical name,
cetirizine treatment allergic rhinitis. looked humans, not
mouse study, study humans. sexes, males females. one
case, looking 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects. other, 65 subjects, decent
number subjects, randomized trial, double blind. cases saw significant decreases
nasal obstruction, improved ability smell, improved sleep, daily working
inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,

medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal
prominent "Nature" featuring upfront, think really mark
beginning new path medicine. just underscore point little bit further,
National Institutes Health, course cancer institute, eye institute,

going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times

fermented foods. talked bunch times podcast,
data colleague, Justin Sonnenburg's lab Stanford Med. there, just
wiped eyes. Yep, got me. paper published journal "Cell,"
absolutely spectacular journal, really points fact people eat fermented
foods, two four servings per day, helps reduce activity certain cytokines. Now,
know are, right? Cells make cytokines call out, "help me, help me."
reduce amount cytokines, so-called inflammatom. Now doesn't render
cells vulnerable. reason saw reduction IL-6 IL-1,
cytokines people healthy gut microbiome,
fewer cells body infected outside infections therefore less
reason cells crying out, "help," thriving, not suffering. So,
don't wipe eyes, keep hands clean, everyone tells that, right? keep
hands clean, don't wipe eyes, nasal breather, not mouth breather,
unless speaking, exercising eating, keep healthy gut microbiome
eating two four servings day quality, low sugar, fermented foods, things like
sauerkraut, things like natto can access that. tried before, interesting.
sort acquired taste, kimchi, pickles, again, low sugar sources going
sources going effective this. now armed three ways
enhance function immune system combat infection is, like
think separate typical type information get get good sleep,
good nutrition, good social connection, et cetera. stuff still holds true,
three points think can really make

00:34:20 Interleukins Anti-Inflammatory

substantial difference terms bolstering immune system, immune system.
want mention, names going come several times
episode, interleukins like IL-6 IL-1 encourage inflammation,
"help me" signals call cells gobble invaders.
interleukins anti-inflammatory. one like highlight particular,
will come little bit interleukin-10. not IL, insert
number, not interleukins inflammatory, anti-inflammatory.

00:34:56 Sickness Behavior



important point keep mind go forward. Next, like talk
called sickness behavior. indeed category behavior call
sickness behavior informative things can avoid getting
sick. Now, notion sickness behavior goes back several decades more.
interesting way looking function immune system,
bridges us thing calling immune system T-
cells, B-cells, cytokines leukocytes, starts taking us realm
nervous system, course nervous system controls behavior.
sickness behavior suite responses tend undergo
feeling sick. going vary person person, general
categories things happen us wounded
sick dealing infection kind. examining sickness behavior
detail, can really informative routes can take health.
main thing sickness behavior tends involve slowing usual
levels activity. People start feel lethargic, feel like activities
previously relative ease difficult somewhat
overwhelming. thing start see people animals, way,
stop grooming, stop taking care themselves. Not necessarily stopped showering,
although oftentimes case, will stop hair, stop putting
makeup, depending whether not before, might stop. Animals
will stop licking grooming themselves. People will stop taking care cosmetic
appearance. Now not just don't care look sick,
overall suppression certain kinds activities
enhancement kinds activities. really important. Sickness behavior
actually motivated state. state designed accomplish certain things.
One features sickness behavior addition lethargic, loss
grooming, will loss appetite, right? Oftentimes people great appetite
normally just won't feel hungry all. several theories
be. One prominent idea literature discourage vomiting diarrhea,
course can infectious people. So, theory. don't know
ever tested directly, one idea. idea simply
harbor resources sake repair. want talk
told get extra sleep aren't feeling well rest. just like good two


three-year-old constantly asks, "why, why?" Good scientists, good people
interested health information always asking why. get
sleep? happens sleep get sleep sick?
shouldn't just push this? couple reasons
established literature. first seem something
useful slowing circulation ill. One idea data support
slow circulation, blood circulation, not running around
much running all, rather lying down, getting extra rest, maybe sleeping, maybe
even just remaining still, lymphatic system, carries lot immune-
related cells fluids, able ramp levels activity. So, interesting,
right? reducing circulation blood, increasing circulation lymphatic
system. probably familiar lymphatic system
combating infection, lymph nodes can get sore. got lymph nodes behind
ears, groin, armpits, around throat,

00:39:08 People Seek Care Sick, Others Want Alone

around near thyroid, throat, et cetera. So, reason. Now,
people, get sick, psychologically go vulnerable state
really, really want people, people take care them. probably
witnessed this, feel way yourself. 50% people response.
really want taken care of. Now, think adaptive
perspective, makes sense, right? member species ill
less will cry help one form another members species
take care them. course will especially apparent cases people
young enough incapacitated enough can't actually get resources
own. ever really sick, just getting going fridge
restroom can feel like monumental task. 50% people report describe
seeking help support sick. also imagine
non-adaptive response increases opportunity spread
infection caretaker. interesting consideration. Another 50% people
seem opposite response sick. So, somehow, regardless
prior getting ill, sickness behavior engaged neural
circuits brain, indeed neural circuits brain, create stay away


me. don't want bothered. want left alone. don't want taken care of,
right? not stubbornness. literally lack interest disinterest social
connection one sick. see animals too, animals will seek
members species. Others, like unfortunately now passed away
bulldog, Costello. sick always knew go around
back house just hide there. just take away
everybody else. not want taken care of. just natural response
him. don't think trying prevent getting whatever had.
ever somebody doesn't want taken care of, want taken care
of, realize people tend fall two bins naturally, animals tend fall
bins. Regardless species are, 50/50. again,
sickness behavior motivated state. designed slow circulation blood,
increase circulation lymph, killer cells body, reduce
probability infecting others reducing, thought, diarrhea vomit, also
breathing others, interacting others. cases will activate this, don't
want call regressed state, many people feel somewhat more...
adults, feel childlike ill want

00:42:00 Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines

taken care badly. might learned. might innate.
don't know, sickness behavior interesting couple reasons.

going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling

want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types

So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,

probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked

really interesting figured activation nerve endings

important point keep mind go forward. Next, like talk
called sickness behavior. indeed category behavior call
sickness behavior informative things can avoid getting
sick. Now, notion sickness behavior goes back several decades more.
interesting way looking function immune system,
bridges us thing calling immune system T-
cells, B-cells, cytokines leukocytes, starts taking us realm
nervous system, course nervous system controls behavior.
sickness behavior suite responses tend undergo
feeling sick. going vary person person, general
categories things happen us wounded
sick dealing infection kind. examining sickness behavior
detail, can really informative routes can take health.
main thing sickness behavior tends involve slowing usual
levels activity. People start feel lethargic, feel like activities
previously relative ease difficult somewhat
overwhelming. thing start see people animals, way,
stop grooming, stop taking care themselves. Not necessarily stopped showering,
although oftentimes case, will stop hair, stop putting
makeup, depending whether not before, might stop. Animals
will stop licking grooming themselves. People will stop taking care cosmetic
appearance. Now not just don't care look sick,
overall suppression certain kinds activities
enhancement kinds activities. really important. Sickness behavior
actually motivated state. state designed accomplish certain things.
One features sickness behavior addition lethargic, loss
grooming, will loss appetite, right? Oftentimes people great appetite
normally just won't feel hungry all. several theories
be. One prominent idea literature discourage vomiting diarrhea,
course can infectious people. So, theory. don't know
ever tested directly, one idea. idea simply
harbor resources sake repair. want talk
told get extra sleep aren't feeling well rest. just like good two


three-year-old constantly asks, "why, why?" Good scientists, good people
interested health information always asking why. get
sleep? happens sleep get sleep sick?
shouldn't just push this? couple reasons
established literature. first seem something
useful slowing circulation ill. One idea data support
slow circulation, blood circulation, not running around
much running all, rather lying down, getting extra rest, maybe sleeping, maybe
even just remaining still, lymphatic system, carries lot immune-
related cells fluids, able ramp levels activity. So, interesting,
right? reducing circulation blood, increasing circulation lymphatic
system. probably familiar lymphatic system
combating infection, lymph nodes can get sore. got lymph nodes behind
ears, groin, armpits, around throat,

00:39:08 People Seek Care Sick, Others Want Alone

around near thyroid, throat, et cetera. So, reason. Now,
people, get sick, psychologically go vulnerable state
really, really want people, people take care them. probably
witnessed this, feel way yourself. 50% people response.
really want taken care of. Now, think adaptive
perspective, makes sense, right? member species ill
less will cry help one form another members species
take care them. course will especially apparent cases people
young enough incapacitated enough can't actually get resources
own. ever really sick, just getting going fridge
restroom can feel like monumental task. 50% people report describe
seeking help support sick. also imagine
non-adaptive response increases opportunity spread
infection caretaker. interesting consideration. Another 50% people
seem opposite response sick. So, somehow, regardless
prior getting ill, sickness behavior engaged neural
circuits brain, indeed neural circuits brain, create stay away


me. don't want bothered. want left alone. don't want taken care of,
right? not stubbornness. literally lack interest disinterest social
connection one sick. see animals too, animals will seek
members species. Others, like unfortunately now passed away
bulldog, Costello. sick always knew go around
back house just hide there. just take away
everybody else. not want taken care of. just natural response
him. don't think trying prevent getting whatever had.
ever somebody doesn't want taken care of, want taken care
of, realize people tend fall two bins naturally, animals tend fall
bins. Regardless species are, 50/50. again,
sickness behavior motivated state. designed slow circulation blood,
increase circulation lymph, killer cells body, reduce

want call regressed state, many people feel somewhat more...
adults, feel childlike ill want

00:42:00 Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines

taken care badly. might learned. might innate.
don't know, sickness behavior interesting couple reasons.
First all, mimics another state described neuroscience literature,
major depression. sick individuals, sick bacterial viral
infection, people major depression, shown robust
increases levels interleukin-6 tumor necrosis factor alpha.
idea now circulating depression involves inflammatory cytokines
active. know illness involves inflammatory cytokines active.
think it, similarity major depression sick

move illness quickly. head direction, indeed
case, just want emphasize sickness behavior provides
bridge immune system nervous system. soon see
also healthy behavior, behavior allows us avoid infection, also points


clear bridge nervous system immune system. isn't just
brain body organs, immune system.
true, interacting time. going lead us place
going clear not surprising certain patterns thinking
certain behaviors

00:43:40 Reduced Appetites Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido

can elect take can help enhance immune system function vice versa.
two features sickness behavior definitely worth pointing out. One
theory, reduced appetite, particular appetite protein rich foods
sick, thought attempt, subconscious attempt, organism
reduce amount iron taking in. Now, typically amount iron intake
recommended less men, eight milligrams per day.
women, anywhere 18 27 milligrams per day, depending whether not
pregnant, lactating menstruating, et cetera, ranges can vary. But,
indeed, true iron levels blood go high, like 45 milligrams per day
can toxic system. theory prominent biology literature
health literature reduction appetite actually attempt
reduce iron intake specifically many bacteria forms infection seem
thrive levels iron blood high. don't want see anyone take
extreme suddenly iron deprivation diet order get well.
interesting theory remiss didn't mention, makes good sense.
Iron actually attached hemoglobin red blood cells bloodstream. Normally
can help us quite lot. also muscle, mention that. Iron can
sequestered muscle, iron serves lot important health promoting roles,
reducing appetite thereby reducing iron intake, reduce capacity
certain things, including infections travel certain compartments within body. So,
again, just theory, think many probably familiar not
appetite sick. thing typical people major
depression loss appetite, not always often loss appetite. So, again,
loss appetite sickness behavior, loss appetite major depression,
perhaps not surprisingly one major symptoms sickness behavior major
depression map less onto one another loss libido interest, not just


social interactions, sex reproduction. so, again, think
sickness behavior depression, very, similar. Okay, sickness
behavior major depression certain core features common. need
therefore ask sick influence way think
perceive environment impact appetite, whether not want
cared cared less? Again, people tend diverge two different bins
there,

question every good scientist, two year old health information seeker asks,
why? How? world work? work? Well make
long story shortish, going go depth here, reason works
sympathetic nervous system, so-called stress part nervous

mild stress, severe stress, even panic, causes release adrenaline

sort invading infection, body able push back that, resist engaging

course. behavioral protocol people deliberately employing allows
activate sympathetic nervous system, turn allows activate

reason underscoring common interpretation study
somehow blocks normal immune response, not really happening
here. Yes, reduction inflammatory cytokines increase anti-
inflammatory cytokines, not really thing blocking immune
response. just easily viewed enhancing immune response
combating intruder, case, E. coli. So, parse study little bit
closely. First all, magical pattern breathing? may
recognize so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim, course Dutchman. think
occupation online used listed daredevil, believe not, Wikipedia.
pretty cool occupation. Wim best known activities cold exposure, holds
multiple world records that, swimming icebergs incredible feats,
definitely don't want try unless extremely skilled really know
doing, does, also use breath work. breathing so-
called Wim Hof breathing similar, not exactly same, similar

retentions. So, hot seat anyway, might well
demonstrate know looks like. variations this,
respect Wim, respect Tummo practitioners, respect cyclic
hyperventilators everywhere, one general theme it. involves 20 30 deep


inhales exhales mouth, followed exhale one's air
breath hold, retention. point, 15 60 seconds later,
repeating 25 30 breaths. again, breath hold lungs empty.
variations this, laboratory particular study, looks something
like this. Okay, not going whole thing right now, goes something like
this. [Andrew deeply breathing] Okay, assume 30 breaths. can
already feel perspiring little bit. heating up, release
adrenaline. caused breathing pattern, exhaling one's air, no
speaking like doing. [Andrew deeply exhaling] sitting lungs
empty one feels impulse breathe repeating several rounds, two
three even four rounds. Now people will also introduce big inhale

looked people cyclic hyperventilation retention, 25 30 breaths,
retention, 25 30 breaths, retention, 25 30 breaths, retention.
So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various
duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,
get sick. Well, just experienced effect adrenaline,
epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,
order keep fighting combating infection. brings us larger theme,
stress combating infection wound not one unique system.
stress system use combat psychological stress.
very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline
epinephrin, actually better able combat infections reduce
inflammation whole feeling lousy response, right? Remember reduced flu-like
symptoms here. pattern breathing actually useful tool. confess,
use pattern breathing anytime initial stages getting sort
bug. feel like running ragged, somehow, whatever reason,
tickle throat, kind sensation nose, like might've
caught bug sort, will pattern breathing.

me, one concrete examples zero cost tool bridges activation

obviously off chance black something like that,
disastrous. So, please careful. again, don't try push breath hold.

rounds 25 30 breaths

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine

significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological

say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie

Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something

new concept all, somehow human beings, challenged idea
actually think sick. paper Kataoka shows

subjects stressful real event, cue associative learning.
So, maybe, like PILOT V5s, love much, traumatize

So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment

used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally

inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific

neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,

speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2

send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons

medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal

First all, mimics another state described neuroscience literature,

00:43:40 Reduced Appetites Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido

two features sickness behavior definitely worth pointing out. One
theory, reduced appetite, particular appetite protein rich foods
sick, thought attempt, subconscious attempt, organism
reduce amount iron taking in. Now, typically amount iron intake
recommended less men, eight milligrams per day.
women, anywhere 18 27 milligrams per day, depending whether not

indeed, true iron levels blood go high, like 45 milligrams per day
can toxic system. theory prominent biology literature

interesting theory remiss didn't mention, makes good sense.
Iron actually attached hemoglobin red blood cells bloodstream. Normally

sequestered muscle, iron serves lot important health promoting roles,
reducing appetite thereby reducing iron intake, reduce capacity
certain things, including infections travel certain compartments within body. So,
again, just theory, think many probably familiar not

depression loss appetite, not always often loss appetite. So, again,
loss appetite sickness behavior, loss appetite major depression,
perhaps not surprisingly one major symptoms sickness behavior major
depression map less onto one another loss libido interest, not just


social interactions, sex reproduction. so, again, think
sickness behavior depression, very, similar. Okay, sickness

amount placed system. very, interesting. leads


question every good scientist, two year old health information seeker asks,
why? How? world work? work? Well make
long story shortish, going go depth here, reason works
sympathetic nervous system, so-called stress part nervous
system, not really called that, part nervous system triggers stress
mild stress, severe stress, even panic, causes release adrenaline
epinephrin brain body. normal circumstances,
sort invading infection, body able push back that, resist engaging

course. behavioral protocol people deliberately employing allows
activate sympathetic nervous system, turn allows activate
normal pathways immune system function enhanced. Okay? Now,
reason underscoring common interpretation study
somehow blocks normal immune response, not really happening
here. Yes, reduction inflammatory cytokines increase anti-
inflammatory cytokines, not really thing blocking immune
response. just easily viewed enhancing immune response
combating intruder, case, E. coli. So, parse study little bit
closely. First all, magical pattern breathing? may
recognize so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim, course Dutchman. think
occupation online used listed daredevil, believe not, Wikipedia.
pretty cool occupation. Wim best known activities cold exposure, holds
multiple world records that, swimming icebergs incredible feats,
definitely don't want try unless extremely skilled really know
doing, does, also use breath work. breathing so-
called Wim Hof breathing similar, not exactly same, similar
Tummo breathing, described historically. science physiology

retentions. So, hot seat anyway, might well
demonstrate know looks like. variations this,
respect Wim, respect Tummo practitioners, respect cyclic
hyperventilators everywhere, one general theme it. involves 20 30 deep


inhales exhales mouth, followed exhale one's air
breath hold, retention. point, 15 60 seconds later,
repeating 25 30 breaths. again, breath hold lungs empty.
variations this, laboratory particular study, looks something
like this. Okay, not going whole thing right now, goes something like
this. [Andrew deeply breathing] Okay, assume 30 breaths. can
already feel perspiring little bit. heating up, release
adrenaline. caused breathing pattern, exhaling one's air, no
speaking like doing. [Andrew deeply exhaling] sitting lungs
empty one feels impulse breathe repeating several rounds, two
three even four rounds. Now people will also introduce big inhale
breath hold end find indeed can hold breath much longer
normally able to. trigger breathe normally activated
increases carbon dioxide blood. neurons brain stem
various regions brain, actually, respond carbon dioxide high
trigger reflex breathe. exhale deeply, blow off lot carbon

looked people cyclic hyperventilation retention, 25 30 breaths,
retention, 25 30 breaths, retention, 25 30 breaths, retention.
So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various
duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,
get sick. Well, just experienced effect adrenaline,
epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,
order keep fighting combating infection. brings us larger theme,
stress combating infection wound not one unique system.
stress system use combat psychological stress.
very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline
epinephrin, actually better able combat infections reduce
inflammation whole feeling lousy response, right? Remember reduced flu-like
symptoms here. pattern breathing actually useful tool. confess,
use pattern breathing anytime initial stages getting sort
bug. feel like running ragged, somehow, whatever reason,
tickle throat, kind sensation nose, like might've
caught bug sort, will pattern breathing.
consistently, gosh, last four years more. Now just anecdotal reports,
find allows indeed either early symptoms disappear, allows
just kind push harder, longer. don't suggest people continue


push exposure infections. Obviously don't want infect people,
want crash suddenly get massive illness sort
stopped breathing. think useful tool. purely behavioral
intervention shown now additional studies way,
enhance function immune system reduce inflammation.
me, one concrete examples zero cost tool bridges activation

adrenaline thereby reducing terrible effects feelings lousiness from,
case, E. coli infection. Now, like focus couple important points
haven't heard discussed broadly elsewhere, hyperventilation
breath retention important. can't simply hyperventilate get effect

shown hyperventilation phase hypoxia, low oxygen
saturation due breath retention, combine increase epinephrin

30 breaths retention, meaning exhale breath hold, order
get full effect. also want provide critical cautionary note. Don't
anywhere near water driving car. things might seem kind obvious,
obviously off chance black something like that,
disastrous. So, please careful. again, don't try push breath hold.
moment feel impulse breathe, just breathe. seem three
rounds 25 30 breaths

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine
systems, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like nucleus
accumbens, et cetera. reward system associated dopamine
norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological
pathways also specific protocols related mindset. guess simple way frame
say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie
notion can worry sick? discovered new pathway
able activate pathway independent worry stress see illness
occur, able inhibit pathway, block activity neural pathway
prevent psychogenic fever worrying oneself sick. So, able
controlled way. just mention pathway case want look
detail. corticolimbic pathway. So, just orient us, cortex

stored kind long-term hard drive type storage. corticolimbic pathway one
thoughts, prior experiences can literally structure way, feed
onto areas brain control basal processes, including temperature
regulation. corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway. talked earlier
hypothalamus controlling temperature lot sickness related behavior, right?
Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic

call it. important conceptually pathway originates insights
brain associated thinking, emotion prior history, feeds
directly area brain involved basic physiological subconsciously
controlled processes. So, incredible, right? points physical pathway
way think something changes something core physiology.
Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something
excites you, heart rate can increase. think something terrifies you,
heart rate can increase. idea thinking controls physiology not
new concept all, somehow human beings, challenged idea
actually think sick. paper Kataoka shows
expose somebody psychological stress, can actually activate
pathway create fever. that? Well, can exposing


subjects stressful real event, cue associative learning.
So, maybe, like PILOT V5s, love much, traumatize
PILOT V5 horrible experience happen looking
concentrating PILOT V5. take away horrible experience, give
PILOT V5, start experience lot symptoms associated
terrible event. able using sickness inducing stimuli forth.
various derivations identified pathway activated, even
absence horrible event, create fever illness-like behavior
forth. blocked certain stations along neural pathway, block
effect. really concrete evidence, proof, will, dedicated
pathways mammalian brain, brain mine, allow us turn thoughts

health wellbeing. many, many studies now starting wick related
this. also idea augmenting dopamine system can increase
rate healing. so, individuals opt, instance, take
things increase dopamine. Now, obviously drugs abuse not good idea


context, even though increase dopamine, lead big crashes,
addictive properties, et cetera. talked podcast things like L-
tyrosine, taking anywhere 500 750 milligrams can increase dopamine
tyrosine dopamine precursor, course. Things like Mucuna pruriens, L-
dopa, immediate precursor dopamine. will lead somewhat
crash certain individuals. people tolerate little bit better. Again,
talk doctor, figure right you. bipolar

recommending all, just mentioning potential exploration safe
right you. point this: dopamine system, activated can
accelerate healing, can accelerate recovery injury kinds.
shouldn't come mystery surprise result us. reward pathway
fact related sense future seems liberate entire systems
within body make inflammatory cytokines go down, anti-inflammatory
cytokines go up. Exactly demonstrated beautiful PNAS study
breathing, cyclic hyperventilation, used increase epinephrin, increase
norepinephrine, augment catecholamine system. So, think bridges
studies really relevant. one case, talking potentially
taking over-the-counter compound increase dopamine accelerate healing.
another case, talking using breathing. also use cold water
exposure increase dopamine. talked several episodes ago,
shown immersing oneself cold water neck so. cold? Well,
depends can tolerate, uncomfortably cold, not cold
become hypothermic, challenging get in, can stay three
10 minutes so, shown lead significant, doubling
baseline dopamine levels epinephrin levels go several hours. may
basis people will cold showers ice baths get sauna.
So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment
neurotransmitters. Today, talking neurotransmitters can
used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally
exposure cold water, instance, can done even just simply breathing
particular way, cyclic hyperventilation followed retention. catacholamines,


noradrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine bridge activation immune

think them, meaning dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, able
deploy larger amounts immune cells,

01:42:05 You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis

types immune cells talked beginning episode. Okay,
thus far, discussing one can prevent getting sick one starts
feel ill, one might able shorten course infection ramping

fact can inhibit sleep, fact can cause dehydration, fact can
make people feel kind lightheaded jittery makes not terrific choices
number people. interesting alternative choice. say alternative,
mean alternative. choice referring spirulina, actually
form algae. Years ago, think first heard spirulina, sounded much
kind 1970s, 80s health food store variety. seemed really kind mystical
wacky, actually now really nice studies data, also


understanding mechanism spirulina can potent effects reducing
called rhinitis, fancy word congestion nose
inflammation nose. Basically, anytime hear word includes "itis," least
medical health context, generally means inflammation tissue.
rhinitis just inflammation nasal passages, one
uncomfortable symptoms kind infection. two studies like
highlight just quickly. One effects spirulina allergic rhinitis.
clinical comparison efficacy spirulina platensis, technical name,
cetirizine treatment allergic rhinitis. looked humans, not
mouse study, study humans. sexes, males females. one
case, looking 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects. other, 65 subjects, decent
number subjects, randomized trial, double blind. cases saw significant decreases
nasal obstruction, improved ability smell, improved sleep, daily working
inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,
region hind brain back brain kind near neck
medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal
prominent "Nature" featuring upfront, think really mark
beginning new path medicine. just underscore point little bit further,
National Institutes Health, course cancer institute, eye institute,
deal trying combat cancer cure blindness forth. now

dollars put kinds explorations talking undoubtedly
going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times
hope learning new emerging science hearing

remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,

basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards

going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast

Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types

So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,

vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked

duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,
get sick. Well, just experienced effect adrenaline,
epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,
order keep fighting combating infection. brings us larger theme,
stress combating infection wound not one unique system.
stress system use combat psychological stress.
very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline
epinephrin, actually better able combat infections reduce
inflammation whole feeling lousy response, right? Remember reduced flu-like
symptoms here. pattern breathing actually useful tool. confess,
use pattern breathing anytime initial stages getting sort
bug. feel like running ragged, somehow, whatever reason,
tickle throat, kind sensation nose, like might've
caught bug sort, will pattern breathing.
consistently, gosh, last four years more. Now just anecdotal reports,
find allows indeed either early symptoms disappear, allows
just kind push harder, longer. don't suggest people continue


push exposure infections. Obviously don't want infect people,
want crash suddenly get massive illness sort
stopped breathing. think useful tool. purely behavioral
intervention shown now additional studies way,
enhance function immune system reduce inflammation.
me, one concrete examples zero cost tool bridges activation
nervous system breathing immune system way releasing
adrenaline thereby reducing terrible effects feelings lousiness from,
case, E. coli infection. Now, like focus couple important points
haven't heard discussed broadly elsewhere, hyperventilation
breath retention important. can't simply hyperventilate get effect
level epinephrin release reduction inflammatory cytokines.
shown hyperventilation phase hypoxia, low oxygen
saturation due breath retention, combine increase epinephrin
adrenaline levels. So, 25 30 breaths, retention. 25
30 breaths retention, meaning exhale breath hold, order
get full effect. also want provide critical cautionary note. Don't
anywhere near water driving car. things might seem kind obvious,
obviously off chance black something like that,
disastrous. So, please careful. again, don't try push breath hold.
moment feel impulse breathe, just breathe. seem three
rounds 25 30 breaths

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine
systems, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like nucleus
accumbens, et cetera. reward system associated dopamine
norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological
pathways also specific protocols related mindset. guess simple way frame
say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie
notion can worry sick? discovered new pathway
able activate pathway independent worry stress see illness
occur, able inhibit pathway, block activity neural pathway
prevent psychogenic fever worrying oneself sick. So, able
controlled way. just mention pathway case want look
detail. corticolimbic pathway. So, just orient us, cortex
less outer shell brain. involved thinking sensation perceptions
learning maintenance lot memories stored there. hear
learn remember hippocampus, initial site learning
memory, information, believe not, passed off cortex
stored kind long-term hard drive type storage. corticolimbic pathway one
thoughts, prior experiences can literally structure way, feed
onto areas brain control basal processes, including temperature
regulation. corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway. talked earlier
hypothalamus controlling temperature lot sickness related behavior, right?
Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic
pathway, fancy name. dorsal peduncular cortex, dorsal tinea tecta.
short DP/DTT. just call DP/DTT, dorsomedial
hypothalamus. lot D's. shouldn't mean anything. doesn't really matter
call it. important conceptually pathway originates insights
brain associated thinking, emotion prior history, feeds
directly area brain involved basic physiological subconsciously
controlled processes. So, incredible, right? points physical pathway
way think something changes something core physiology.
Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something
excites you, heart rate can increase. think something terrifies you,
heart rate can increase. idea thinking controls physiology not
new concept all, somehow human beings, challenged idea
actually think sick. paper Kataoka shows
expose somebody psychological stress, can actually activate
pathway create fever. that? Well, can exposing


subjects stressful real event, cue associative learning.
So, maybe, like PILOT V5s, love much, traumatize
PILOT V5 horrible experience happen looking
concentrating PILOT V5. take away horrible experience, give
PILOT V5, start experience lot symptoms associated
terrible event. able using sickness inducing stimuli forth.
various derivations identified pathway activated, even
absence horrible event, create fever illness-like behavior
forth. blocked certain stations along neural pathway, block
effect. really concrete evidence, proof, will, dedicated
pathways mammalian brain, brain mine, allow us turn thoughts
illness.

01:37:00 Tool 8: Healthy Mindsets, Hope, Dopamine; Tool 9: Tyrosine; Tool 10: Cold
Exposure

kind depressing idea. inverse? turning thoughts
health? Well, work Asya Rolls. explored well-established
psychological phenomenon cancer patients ill people people
suffering debilitating injuries, people reported sense hope,
rates recovery much higher, right? Sounds subjective.
sense hope? sense hope sense future. sense future tightly
associated dopamine system. Dopamine, again, molecule reward
motivation movement, movement motivation things
beyond confines skin future.
discovered studies groups discovered
stimulation dopamine pathway, either simply thinking future, ideally
positive future, thinking positive future leads activation so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway reduce size tumors, accelerate
wound healing, greatly accelerate passage state illness state
health wellbeing. many, many studies now starting wick related
this. also idea augmenting dopamine system can increase
rate healing. so, individuals opt, instance, take
things increase dopamine. Now, obviously drugs abuse not good idea


context, even though increase dopamine, lead big crashes,
addictive properties, et cetera. talked podcast things like L-
tyrosine, taking anywhere 500 750 milligrams can increase dopamine
tyrosine dopamine precursor, course. Things like Mucuna pruriens, L-
dopa, immediate precursor dopamine. will lead somewhat
crash certain individuals. people tolerate little bit better. Again,
talk doctor, figure right you. bipolar
mania schizophrenia, things, not recommend all. not
recommending all, just mentioning potential exploration safe
right you. point this: dopamine system, activated can
accelerate healing, can accelerate recovery injury kinds.
shouldn't come mystery surprise result us. reward pathway
fact related sense future seems liberate entire systems
within body make inflammatory cytokines go down, anti-inflammatory
cytokines go up. Exactly demonstrated beautiful PNAS study
breathing, cyclic hyperventilation, used increase epinephrin, increase
norepinephrine, augment catecholamine system. So, think bridges
studies really relevant. one case, talking potentially
taking over-the-counter compound increase dopamine accelerate healing.
another case, talking using breathing. also use cold water
exposure increase dopamine. talked several episodes ago,
shown immersing oneself cold water neck so. cold? Well,
depends can tolerate, uncomfortably cold, not cold
become hypothermic, challenging get in, can stay three
10 minutes so, shown lead significant, doubling
baseline dopamine levels epinephrin levels go several hours. may
basis people will cold showers ice baths get sauna.
So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment
neurotransmitters. Today, talking neurotransmitters can
used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally
exposure cold water, instance, can done even just simply breathing
particular way, cyclic hyperventilation followed retention. catacholamines,


noradrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine bridge activation immune
system nervous system. way nervous system calls
immune system, "Aha, problem. need counter this." can
think them, meaning dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, able
deploy larger amounts immune cells,

01:42:05 You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis

types immune cells talked beginning episode. Okay,
thus far, discussing one can prevent getting sick one starts
feel ill, one might able shorten course infection ramping
activity immune system. already experiencing
symptoms? runny nose, stuffed nose, congestion, headache, et cetera. Well,
many ways address symptom level. probably aware
counter medications, many focus epinephrin system. Things
Sudafed variety prevent reduce congestion way
cause release epinephrin, effects dilating bronchioles
dilating nasal passages forth. not going speak whether not
good bad choices. couple effects not great
course treating underlying cause, first can cause dehydration.
make sure hydrating well, fluids electrolytes,
also can interfere sleep talked episodes sleep,
one hallmarks deep sleep particular REM sleep epinephrin,
adrenaline levels low. allows intense, often
emotionally-laden dreams REM sleep not act out. low adrenaline,
epinephrin REM sleep basically signature, neurochemical signature
REM sleep state, vital emotional physical repair forth. So,
fact can inhibit sleep, fact can cause dehydration, fact can
make people feel kind lightheaded jittery makes not terrific choices
number people. interesting alternative choice. say alternative,
mean alternative. choice referring spirulina, actually
form algae. Years ago, think first heard spirulina, sounded much
kind 1970s, 80s health food store variety. seemed really kind mystical
wacky, actually now really nice studies data, also


understanding mechanism spirulina can potent effects reducing
called rhinitis, fancy word congestion nose
inflammation nose. Basically, anytime hear word includes "itis," least
medical health context, generally means inflammation tissue.
rhinitis just inflammation nasal passages, one
uncomfortable symptoms kind infection. two studies like
highlight just quickly. One effects spirulina allergic rhinitis.
clinical comparison efficacy spirulina platensis, technical name,
cetirizine treatment allergic rhinitis. looked humans, not
mouse study, study humans. sexes, males females. one
case, looking 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects. other, 65 subjects, decent
number subjects, randomized trial, double blind. cases saw significant decreases
nasal obstruction, improved ability smell, improved sleep, daily working
inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,
region hind brain back brain kind near neck
medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal
prominent "Nature" featuring upfront, think really mark
beginning new path medicine. just underscore point little bit further,
National Institutes Health, course cancer institute, eye institute,
deal trying combat cancer cure blindness forth. now
called NCCIH, complimentary health. so, good tax
dollars put kinds explorations talking undoubtedly
going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times
hope learning new emerging science hearing
protocols either zero cost low cost, certainly respiration

amount placed system. very, interesting. leads


question every good scientist, two year old health information seeker asks,
why? How? world work? work? Well make
long story shortish, going go depth here, reason works
sympathetic nervous system, so-called stress part nervous
system, not really called that, part nervous system triggers stress
mild stress, severe stress, even panic, causes release adrenaline
epinephrin brain body. normal circumstances,
sort invading infection, body able push back that, resist engaging

course. behavioral protocol people deliberately employing allows
activate sympathetic nervous system, turn allows activate
normal pathways immune system function enhanced. Okay? Now,
reason underscoring common interpretation study
somehow blocks normal immune response, not really happening
here. Yes, reduction inflammatory cytokines increase anti-
inflammatory cytokines, not really thing blocking immune
response. just easily viewed enhancing immune response
combating intruder, case, E. coli. So, parse study little bit
closely. First all, magical pattern breathing? may
recognize so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim, course Dutchman. think
occupation online used listed daredevil, believe not, Wikipedia.
pretty cool occupation. Wim best known activities cold exposure, holds
multiple world records that, swimming icebergs incredible feats,
definitely don't want try unless extremely skilled really know
doing, does, also use breath work. breathing so-
called Wim Hof breathing similar, not exactly same, similar
Tummo breathing, described historically. science physiology

retentions. So, hot seat anyway, might well
demonstrate know looks like. variations this,
respect Wim, respect Tummo practitioners, respect cyclic
hyperventilators everywhere, one general theme it. involves 20 30 deep


inhales exhales mouth, followed exhale one's air
breath hold, retention. point, 15 60 seconds later,
repeating 25 30 breaths. again, breath hold lungs empty.
variations this, laboratory particular study, looks something
like this. Okay, not going whole thing right now, goes something like
this. [Andrew deeply breathing] Okay, assume 30 breaths. can
already feel perspiring little bit. heating up, release
adrenaline. caused breathing pattern, exhaling one's air, no
speaking like doing. [Andrew deeply exhaling] sitting lungs
empty one feels impulse breathe repeating several rounds, two
three even four rounds. Now people will also introduce big inhale

looked people cyclic hyperventilation retention, 25 30 breaths,
retention, 25 30 breaths, retention, 25 30 breaths, retention.
So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various
duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,
get sick. Well, just experienced effect adrenaline,
epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,
order keep fighting combating infection. brings us larger theme,
stress combating infection wound not one unique system.
stress system use combat psychological stress.
very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline
epinephrin, actually better able combat infections reduce
inflammation whole feeling lousy response, right? Remember reduced flu-like
symptoms here. pattern breathing actually useful tool. confess,
use pattern breathing anytime initial stages getting sort
bug. feel like running ragged, somehow, whatever reason,
tickle throat, kind sensation nose, like might've
caught bug sort, will pattern breathing.
consistently, gosh, last four years more. Now just anecdotal reports,
find allows indeed either early symptoms disappear, allows

push exposure infections. Obviously don't want infect people,
want crash suddenly get massive illness sort

enhance function immune system reduce inflammation.
me, one concrete examples zero cost tool bridges activation

30 breaths retention, meaning exhale breath hold, order
get full effect. also want provide critical cautionary note. Don't
anywhere near water driving car. things might seem kind obvious,
obviously off chance black something like that,
disastrous. So, please careful. again, don't try push breath hold.

rounds 25 30 breaths

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine
systems, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like nucleus
accumbens, et cetera. reward system associated dopamine
norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological
pathways also specific protocols related mindset. guess simple way frame
say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie
notion can worry sick? discovered new pathway
able activate pathway independent worry stress see illness
occur, able inhibit pathway, block activity neural pathway
prevent psychogenic fever worrying oneself sick. So, able
controlled way. just mention pathway case want look

thoughts, prior experiences can literally structure way, feed
onto areas brain control basal processes, including temperature
regulation. corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway. talked earlier
hypothalamus controlling temperature lot sickness related behavior, right?
Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic

brain associated thinking, emotion prior history, feeds

way think something changes something core physiology.
Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something

heart rate can increase. idea thinking controls physiology not
new concept all, somehow human beings, challenged idea
actually think sick. paper Kataoka shows
expose somebody psychological stress, can actually activate

subjects stressful real event, cue associative learning.
So, maybe, like PILOT V5s, love much, traumatize
PILOT V5 horrible experience happen looking
concentrating PILOT V5. take away horrible experience, give
PILOT V5, start experience lot symptoms associated

various derivations identified pathway activated, even

context, even though increase dopamine, lead big crashes,
addictive properties, et cetera. talked podcast things like L-
tyrosine, taking anywhere 500 750 milligrams can increase dopamine
tyrosine dopamine precursor, course. Things like Mucuna pruriens, L-

fact related sense future seems liberate entire systems
within body make inflammatory cytokines go down, anti-inflammatory
cytokines go up. Exactly demonstrated beautiful PNAS study
breathing, cyclic hyperventilation, used increase epinephrin, increase
norepinephrine, augment catecholamine system. So, think bridges
studies really relevant. one case, talking potentially
taking over-the-counter compound increase dopamine accelerate healing.
another case, talking using breathing. also use cold water
exposure increase dopamine. talked several episodes ago,
shown immersing oneself cold water neck so. cold? Well,

become hypothermic, challenging get in, can stay three
10 minutes so, shown lead significant, doubling
baseline dopamine levels epinephrin levels go several hours. may
basis people will cold showers ice baths get sauna.
So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment
neurotransmitters. Today, talking neurotransmitters can
used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally
exposure cold water, instance, can done even just simply breathing
particular way, cyclic hyperventilation followed retention. catacholamines,


noradrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine bridge activation immune

01:42:05 You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis

types immune cells talked beginning episode. Okay,
thus far, discussing one can prevent getting sick one starts
feel ill, one might able shorten course infection ramping

mean alternative. choice referring spirulina, actually
form algae. Years ago, think first heard spirulina, sounded much
kind 1970s, 80s health food store variety. seemed really kind mystical
wacky, actually now really nice studies data, also


understanding mechanism spirulina can potent effects reducing
called rhinitis, fancy word congestion nose
inflammation nose. Basically, anytime hear word includes "itis," least
medical health context, generally means inflammation tissue.
rhinitis just inflammation nasal passages, one
uncomfortable symptoms kind infection. two studies like
highlight just quickly. One effects spirulina allergic rhinitis.
clinical comparison efficacy spirulina platensis, technical name,

mouse study, study humans. sexes, males females. one
case, looking 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects. other, 65 subjects, decent
number subjects, randomized trial, double blind. cases saw significant decreases
nasal obstruction, improved ability smell, improved sleep, daily working
inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,
region hind brain back brain kind near neck
medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal
prominent "Nature" featuring upfront, think really mark
beginning new path medicine. just underscore point little bit further,
National Institutes Health, course cancer institute, eye institute,
deal trying combat cancer cure blindness forth. now

dollars put kinds explorations talking undoubtedly
going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times
hope learning new emerging science hearing

couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard

waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline

ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release

probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked

nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not

ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can

practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians

question every good scientist, two year old health information seeker asks,
why? How? world work? work? Well make
long story shortish, going go depth here, reason works
sympathetic nervous system, so-called stress part nervous

reason underscoring common interpretation study
somehow blocks normal immune response, not really happening
here. Yes, reduction inflammatory cytokines increase anti-

closely. First all, magical pattern breathing? may
recognize so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim, course Dutchman. think

pretty cool occupation. Wim best known activities cold exposure, holds
multiple world records that, swimming icebergs incredible feats,

variations this, laboratory particular study, looks something
like this. Okay, not going whole thing right now, goes something like
this. [Andrew deeply breathing] Okay, assume 30 breaths. can
already feel perspiring little bit. heating up, release

So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various
duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,
get sick. Well, just experienced effect adrenaline,
epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,

stress combating infection wound not one unique system.

very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature

system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind

people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse

endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells

types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies

counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people

quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific

send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons

neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance

something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal

question every good scientist, two year old health information seeker asks,
why? How? world work? work? Well make
long story shortish, going go depth here, reason works
sympathetic nervous system, so-called stress part nervous

reason underscoring common interpretation study
somehow blocks normal immune response, not really happening
here. Yes, reduction inflammatory cytokines increase anti-
inflammatory cytokines, not really thing blocking immune

combating intruder, case, E. coli. So, parse study little bit
closely. First all, magical pattern breathing? may
recognize so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim, course Dutchman. think
occupation online used listed daredevil, believe not, Wikipedia.
pretty cool occupation. Wim best known activities cold exposure, holds
multiple world records that, swimming icebergs incredible feats,
definitely don't want try unless extremely skilled really know
doing, does, also use breath work. breathing so-
called Wim Hof breathing similar, not exactly same, similar
Tummo breathing, described historically. science physiology

retentions. So, hot seat anyway, might well
demonstrate know looks like. variations this,
respect Wim, respect Tummo practitioners, respect cyclic
hyperventilators everywhere, one general theme it. involves 20 30 deep


inhales exhales mouth, followed exhale one's air
breath hold, retention. point, 15 60 seconds later,
repeating 25 30 breaths. again, breath hold lungs empty.
variations this, laboratory particular study, looks something
like this. Okay, not going whole thing right now, goes something like
this. [Andrew deeply breathing] Okay, assume 30 breaths. can
already feel perspiring little bit. heating up, release
adrenaline. caused breathing pattern, exhaling one's air, no
speaking like doing. [Andrew deeply exhaling] sitting lungs
empty one feels impulse breathe repeating several rounds, two
three even four rounds. Now people will also introduce big inhale

So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various
duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,
get sick. Well, just experienced effect adrenaline,
epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,
order keep fighting combating infection. brings us larger theme,
stress combating infection wound not one unique system.
stress system use combat psychological stress.
very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline
epinephrin, actually better able combat infections reduce
inflammation whole feeling lousy response, right? Remember reduced flu-like

use pattern breathing anytime initial stages getting sort

breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown

brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind

essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,

paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie

Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic

thus far, discussing one can prevent getting sick one starts

make people feel kind lightheaded jittery makes not terrific choices
number people. interesting alternative choice. say alternative,
mean alternative. choice referring spirulina, actually
form algae. Years ago, think first heard spirulina, sounded much
kind 1970s, 80s health food store variety. seemed really kind mystical
wacky, actually now really nice studies data, also


understanding mechanism spirulina can potent effects reducing
called rhinitis, fancy word congestion nose
inflammation nose. Basically, anytime hear word includes "itis," least
medical health context, generally means inflammation tissue.
rhinitis just inflammation nasal passages, one

highlight just quickly. One effects spirulina allergic rhinitis.
clinical comparison efficacy spirulina platensis, technical name,

nasal obstruction, improved ability smell, improved sleep, daily working
inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2

send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons

neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance

something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,

looked people cyclic hyperventilation retention, 25 30 breaths,
retention, 25 30 breaths, retention, 25 30 breaths, retention.
So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various
duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,
get sick. Well, just experienced effect adrenaline,
epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,
order keep fighting combating infection. brings us larger theme,
stress combating infection wound not one unique system.
stress system use combat psychological stress.
very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline
epinephrin, actually better able combat infections reduce
inflammation whole feeling lousy response, right? Remember reduced flu-like
symptoms here. pattern breathing actually useful tool. confess,
use pattern breathing anytime initial stages getting sort
bug. feel like running ragged, somehow, whatever reason,
tickle throat, kind sensation nose, like might've
caught bug sort, will pattern breathing.
consistently, gosh, last four years more. Now just anecdotal reports,
find allows indeed either early symptoms disappear, allows
just kind push harder, longer. don't suggest people continue


push exposure infections. Obviously don't want infect people,
want crash suddenly get massive illness sort
stopped breathing. think useful tool. purely behavioral
intervention shown now additional studies way,
enhance function immune system reduce inflammation.
me, one concrete examples zero cost tool bridges activation

adrenaline thereby reducing terrible effects feelings lousiness from,
case, E. coli infection. Now, like focus couple important points
haven't heard discussed broadly elsewhere, hyperventilation
breath retention important. can't simply hyperventilate get effect

shown hyperventilation phase hypoxia, low oxygen
saturation due breath retention, combine increase epinephrin
adrenaline levels. So, 25 30 breaths, retention. 25
30 breaths retention, meaning exhale breath hold, order
get full effect. also want provide critical cautionary note. Don't
anywhere near water driving car. things might seem kind obvious,
obviously off chance black something like that,
disastrous. So, please careful. again, don't try push breath hold.
moment feel impulse breathe, just breathe. seem three
rounds 25 30 breaths

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine
systems, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like nucleus
accumbens, et cetera. reward system associated dopamine
norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological
pathways also specific protocols related mindset. guess simple way frame
say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie
notion can worry sick? discovered new pathway
able activate pathway independent worry stress see illness
occur, able inhibit pathway, block activity neural pathway
prevent psychogenic fever worrying oneself sick. So, able
controlled way. just mention pathway case want look

stored kind long-term hard drive type storage. corticolimbic pathway one
thoughts, prior experiences can literally structure way, feed
onto areas brain control basal processes, including temperature
regulation. corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway. talked earlier
hypothalamus controlling temperature lot sickness related behavior, right?
Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic
pathway, fancy name. dorsal peduncular cortex, dorsal tinea tecta.
short DP/DTT. just call DP/DTT, dorsomedial
hypothalamus. lot D's. shouldn't mean anything. doesn't really matter
call it. important conceptually pathway originates insights
brain associated thinking, emotion prior history, feeds
directly area brain involved basic physiological subconsciously
controlled processes. So, incredible, right? points physical pathway
way think something changes something core physiology.
Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something
excites you, heart rate can increase. think something terrifies you,
heart rate can increase. idea thinking controls physiology not
new concept all, somehow human beings, challenged idea
actually think sick. paper Kataoka shows
expose somebody psychological stress, can actually activate
pathway create fever. that? Well, can exposing


subjects stressful real event, cue associative learning.
So, maybe, like PILOT V5s, love much, traumatize
PILOT V5 horrible experience happen looking

things increase dopamine. Now, obviously drugs abuse not good idea


context, even though increase dopamine, lead big crashes,
addictive properties, et cetera. talked podcast things like L-
tyrosine, taking anywhere 500 750 milligrams can increase dopamine
tyrosine dopamine precursor, course. Things like Mucuna pruriens, L-

talk doctor, figure right you. bipolar

shouldn't come mystery surprise result us. reward pathway
fact related sense future seems liberate entire systems
within body make inflammatory cytokines go down, anti-inflammatory
cytokines go up. Exactly demonstrated beautiful PNAS study
breathing, cyclic hyperventilation, used increase epinephrin, increase
norepinephrine, augment catecholamine system. So, think bridges
studies really relevant. one case, talking potentially
taking over-the-counter compound increase dopamine accelerate healing.
another case, talking using breathing. also use cold water
exposure increase dopamine. talked several episodes ago,
shown immersing oneself cold water neck so. cold? Well,

basis people will cold showers ice baths get sauna.
So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment
neurotransmitters. Today, talking neurotransmitters can
used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally
exposure cold water, instance, can done even just simply breathing
particular way, cyclic hyperventilation followed retention. catacholamines,


noradrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine bridge activation immune

think them, meaning dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, able
deploy larger amounts immune cells,

01:42:05 You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis

types immune cells talked beginning episode. Okay,
thus far, discussing one can prevent getting sick one starts
feel ill, one might able shorten course infection ramping

fact can inhibit sleep, fact can cause dehydration, fact can
make people feel kind lightheaded jittery makes not terrific choices
number people. interesting alternative choice. say alternative,
mean alternative. choice referring spirulina, actually
form algae. Years ago, think first heard spirulina, sounded much
kind 1970s, 80s health food store variety. seemed really kind mystical
wacky, actually now really nice studies data, also


understanding mechanism spirulina can potent effects reducing
called rhinitis, fancy word congestion nose
inflammation nose. Basically, anytime hear word includes "itis," least
medical health context, generally means inflammation tissue.
rhinitis just inflammation nasal passages, one
uncomfortable symptoms kind infection. two studies like
highlight just quickly. One effects spirulina allergic rhinitis.
clinical comparison efficacy spirulina platensis, technical name,
cetirizine treatment allergic rhinitis. looked humans, not
mouse study, study humans. sexes, males females. one
case, looking 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects. other, 65 subjects, decent
number subjects, randomized trial, double blind. cases saw significant decreases
nasal obstruction, improved ability smell, improved sleep, daily working
inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,

medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal

pretty cool occupation. Wim best known activities cold exposure, holds

variations this, laboratory particular study, looks something
like this. Okay, not going whole thing right now, goes something like
this. [Andrew deeply breathing] Okay, assume 30 breaths. can
already feel perspiring little bit. heating up, release
adrenaline. caused breathing pattern, exhaling one's air, no

So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various
duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,

epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,
order keep fighting combating infection. brings us larger theme,
stress combating infection wound not one unique system.

very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline

obviously off chance black something like that,
disastrous. So, please careful. again, don't try push breath hold.

rounds 25 30 breaths

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine
systems, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like nucleus
accumbens, et cetera. reward system associated dopamine
norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological
pathways also specific protocols related mindset. guess simple way frame
say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie
notion can worry sick? discovered new pathway
able activate pathway independent worry stress see illness

Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic

Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something

new concept all, somehow human beings, challenged idea
actually think sick. paper Kataoka shows

subjects stressful real event, cue associative learning.
So, maybe, like PILOT V5s, love much, traumatize

studies really relevant. one case, talking potentially
taking over-the-counter compound increase dopamine accelerate healing.
another case, talking using breathing. also use cold water

basis people will cold showers ice baths get sauna.
So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment
neurotransmitters. Today, talking neurotransmitters can
used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally
exposure cold water, instance, can done even just simply breathing
particular way, cyclic hyperventilation followed retention. catacholamines,

01:42:05 You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis

types immune cells talked beginning episode. Okay,
thus far, discussing one can prevent getting sick one starts
feel ill, one might able shorten course infection ramping

fact can inhibit sleep, fact can cause dehydration, fact can
make people feel kind lightheaded jittery makes not terrific choices
number people. interesting alternative choice. say alternative,
mean alternative. choice referring spirulina, actually
form algae. Years ago, think first heard spirulina, sounded much
kind 1970s, 80s health food store variety. seemed really kind mystical
wacky, actually now really nice studies data, also


understanding mechanism spirulina can potent effects reducing
called rhinitis, fancy word congestion nose
inflammation nose. Basically, anytime hear word includes "itis," least
medical health context, generally means inflammation tissue.
rhinitis just inflammation nasal passages, one
uncomfortable symptoms kind infection. two studies like
highlight just quickly. One effects spirulina allergic rhinitis.
clinical comparison efficacy spirulina platensis, technical name,

mouse study, study humans. sexes, males females. one
case, looking 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects. other, 65 subjects, decent
number subjects, randomized trial, double blind. cases saw significant decreases
nasal obstruction, improved ability smell, improved sleep, daily working
inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,

medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal

demonstrate know looks like. variations this,
respect Wim, respect Tummo practitioners, respect cyclic

inhales exhales mouth, followed exhale one's air
breath hold, retention. point, 15 60 seconds later,
repeating 25 30 breaths. again, breath hold lungs empty.
variations this, laboratory particular study, looks something
like this. Okay, not going whole thing right now, goes something like
this. [Andrew deeply breathing] Okay, assume 30 breaths. can
already feel perspiring little bit. heating up, release
adrenaline. caused breathing pattern, exhaling one's air, no
speaking like doing. [Andrew deeply exhaling] sitting lungs
empty one feels impulse breathe repeating several rounds, two
three even four rounds. Now people will also introduce big inhale
breath hold end find indeed can hold breath much longer

looked people cyclic hyperventilation retention, 25 30 breaths,
retention, 25 30 breaths, retention, 25 30 breaths, retention.
So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various
duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine
systems, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like nucleus

norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological
pathways also specific protocols related mindset. guess simple way frame
say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie
notion can worry sick? discovered new pathway
able activate pathway independent worry stress see illness

Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic

Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something

another case, talking using breathing. also use cold water

So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment

used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally
exposure cold water, instance, can done even just simply breathing

inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific

neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance

something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,

anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing

alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,
get sick. Well, just experienced effect adrenaline,
epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,
order keep fighting combating infection. brings us larger theme,
stress combating infection wound not one unique system.
stress system use combat psychological stress.
very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline
epinephrin, actually better able combat infections reduce
inflammation whole feeling lousy response, right? Remember reduced flu-like
symptoms here. pattern breathing actually useful tool. confess,
use pattern breathing anytime initial stages getting sort
bug. feel like running ragged, somehow, whatever reason,
tickle throat, kind sensation nose, like might've
caught bug sort, will pattern breathing.
consistently, gosh, last four years more. Now just anecdotal reports,
find allows indeed either early symptoms disappear, allows
just kind push harder, longer. don't suggest people continue


push exposure infections. Obviously don't want infect people,
want crash suddenly get massive illness sort
stopped breathing. think useful tool. purely behavioral
intervention shown now additional studies way,
enhance function immune system reduce inflammation.
me, one concrete examples zero cost tool bridges activation
nervous system breathing immune system way releasing
adrenaline thereby reducing terrible effects feelings lousiness from,
case, E. coli infection. Now, like focus couple important points
haven't heard discussed broadly elsewhere, hyperventilation
breath retention important. can't simply hyperventilate get effect
level epinephrin release reduction inflammatory cytokines.
shown hyperventilation phase hypoxia, low oxygen
saturation due breath retention, combine increase epinephrin
adrenaline levels. So, 25 30 breaths, retention. 25
30 breaths retention, meaning exhale breath hold, order
get full effect. also want provide critical cautionary note. Don't
anywhere near water driving car. things might seem kind obvious,
obviously off chance black something like that,
disastrous. So, please careful. again, don't try push breath hold.
moment feel impulse breathe, just breathe. seem three
rounds 25 30 breaths

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine
systems, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like nucleus
accumbens, et cetera. reward system associated dopamine
norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological
pathways also specific protocols related mindset. guess simple way frame
say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie
notion can worry sick? discovered new pathway
able activate pathway independent worry stress see illness
occur, able inhibit pathway, block activity neural pathway
prevent psychogenic fever worrying oneself sick. So, able
controlled way. just mention pathway case want look
detail. corticolimbic pathway. So, just orient us, cortex
less outer shell brain. involved thinking sensation perceptions
learning maintenance lot memories stored there. hear
learn remember hippocampus, initial site learning
memory, information, believe not, passed off cortex
stored kind long-term hard drive type storage. corticolimbic pathway one
thoughts, prior experiences can literally structure way, feed
onto areas brain control basal processes, including temperature
regulation. corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway. talked earlier
hypothalamus controlling temperature lot sickness related behavior, right?
Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic
pathway, fancy name. dorsal peduncular cortex, dorsal tinea tecta.
short DP/DTT. just call DP/DTT, dorsomedial
hypothalamus. lot D's. shouldn't mean anything. doesn't really matter
call it. important conceptually pathway originates insights
brain associated thinking, emotion prior history, feeds
directly area brain involved basic physiological subconsciously
controlled processes. So, incredible, right? points physical pathway
way think something changes something core physiology.
Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something
excites you, heart rate can increase. think something terrifies you,
heart rate can increase. idea thinking controls physiology not
new concept all, somehow human beings, challenged idea
actually think sick. paper Kataoka shows
expose somebody psychological stress, can actually activate
pathway create fever. that? Well, can exposing


subjects stressful real event, cue associative learning.
So, maybe, like PILOT V5s, love much, traumatize
PILOT V5 horrible experience happen looking
concentrating PILOT V5. take away horrible experience, give
PILOT V5, start experience lot symptoms associated
terrible event. able using sickness inducing stimuli forth.
various derivations identified pathway activated, even
absence horrible event, create fever illness-like behavior
forth. blocked certain stations along neural pathway, block
effect. really concrete evidence, proof, will, dedicated
pathways mammalian brain, brain mine, allow us turn thoughts
illness.

01:37:00 Tool 8: Healthy Mindsets, Hope, Dopamine; Tool 9: Tyrosine; Tool 10: Cold
Exposure

kind depressing idea. inverse? turning thoughts
health? Well, work Asya Rolls. explored well-established
psychological phenomenon cancer patients ill people people
suffering debilitating injuries, people reported sense hope,
rates recovery much higher, right? Sounds subjective.
sense hope? sense hope sense future. sense future tightly
associated dopamine system. Dopamine, again, molecule reward
motivation movement, movement motivation things
beyond confines skin future.
discovered studies groups discovered
stimulation dopamine pathway, either simply thinking future, ideally
positive future, thinking positive future leads activation so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway reduce size tumors, accelerate
wound healing, greatly accelerate passage state illness state
health wellbeing. many, many studies now starting wick related
this. also idea augmenting dopamine system can increase
rate healing. so, individuals opt, instance, take
things increase dopamine. Now, obviously drugs abuse not good idea


context, even though increase dopamine, lead big crashes,
addictive properties, et cetera. talked podcast things like L-
tyrosine, taking anywhere 500 750 milligrams can increase dopamine
tyrosine dopamine precursor, course. Things like Mucuna pruriens, L-
dopa, immediate precursor dopamine. will lead somewhat
crash certain individuals. people tolerate little bit better. Again,
talk doctor, figure right you. bipolar
mania schizophrenia, things, not recommend all. not
recommending all, just mentioning potential exploration safe
right you. point this: dopamine system, activated can
accelerate healing, can accelerate recovery injury kinds.
shouldn't come mystery surprise result us. reward pathway
fact related sense future seems liberate entire systems
within body make inflammatory cytokines go down, anti-inflammatory
cytokines go up. Exactly demonstrated beautiful PNAS study
breathing, cyclic hyperventilation, used increase epinephrin, increase
norepinephrine, augment catecholamine system. So, think bridges
studies really relevant. one case, talking potentially
taking over-the-counter compound increase dopamine accelerate healing.
another case, talking using breathing. also use cold water
exposure increase dopamine. talked several episodes ago,
shown immersing oneself cold water neck so. cold? Well,
depends can tolerate, uncomfortably cold, not cold
become hypothermic, challenging get in, can stay three
10 minutes so, shown lead significant, doubling
baseline dopamine levels epinephrin levels go several hours. may
basis people will cold showers ice baths get sauna.
So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment
neurotransmitters. Today, talking neurotransmitters can
used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally
exposure cold water, instance, can done even just simply breathing
particular way, cyclic hyperventilation followed retention. catacholamines,


noradrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine bridge activation immune
system nervous system. way nervous system calls
immune system, "Aha, problem. need counter this." can
think them, meaning dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, able
deploy larger amounts immune cells,

01:42:05 You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis

types immune cells talked beginning episode. Okay,
thus far, discussing one can prevent getting sick one starts
feel ill, one might able shorten course infection ramping
activity immune system. already experiencing
symptoms? runny nose, stuffed nose, congestion, headache, et cetera. Well,
many ways address symptom level. probably aware
counter medications, many focus epinephrin system. Things
Sudafed variety prevent reduce congestion way
cause release epinephrin, effects dilating bronchioles
dilating nasal passages forth. not going speak whether not
good bad choices. couple effects not great
course treating underlying cause, first can cause dehydration.
make sure hydrating well, fluids electrolytes,
also can interfere sleep talked episodes sleep,
one hallmarks deep sleep particular REM sleep epinephrin,
adrenaline levels low. allows intense, often
emotionally-laden dreams REM sleep not act out. low adrenaline,
epinephrin REM sleep basically signature, neurochemical signature
REM sleep state, vital emotional physical repair forth. So,
fact can inhibit sleep, fact can cause dehydration, fact can
make people feel kind lightheaded jittery makes not terrific choices
number people. interesting alternative choice. say alternative,
mean alternative. choice referring spirulina, actually
form algae. Years ago, think first heard spirulina, sounded much
kind 1970s, 80s health food store variety. seemed really kind mystical
wacky, actually now really nice studies data, also


understanding mechanism spirulina can potent effects reducing
called rhinitis, fancy word congestion nose
inflammation nose. Basically, anytime hear word includes "itis," least
medical health context, generally means inflammation tissue.
rhinitis just inflammation nasal passages, one
uncomfortable symptoms kind infection. two studies like
highlight just quickly. One effects spirulina allergic rhinitis.
clinical comparison efficacy spirulina platensis, technical name,
cetirizine treatment allergic rhinitis. looked humans, not
mouse study, study humans. sexes, males females. one
case, looking 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects. other, 65 subjects, decent
number subjects, randomized trial, double blind. cases saw significant decreases
nasal obstruction, improved ability smell, improved sleep, daily working
inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,
region hind brain back brain kind near neck
medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal
prominent "Nature" featuring upfront, think really mark
beginning new path medicine. just underscore point little bit further,
National Institutes Health, course cancer institute, eye institute,

dollars put kinds explorations talking undoubtedly
going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times
hope learning new emerging science hearing

question every good scientist, two year old health information seeker asks,
why? How? world work? work? Well make
long story shortish, going go depth here, reason works
sympathetic nervous system, so-called stress part nervous
system, not really called that, part nervous system triggers stress
mild stress, severe stress, even panic, causes release adrenaline
epinephrin brain body. normal circumstances,
sort invading infection, body able push back that, resist engaging

course. behavioral protocol people deliberately employing allows
activate sympathetic nervous system, turn allows activate
normal pathways immune system function enhanced. Okay? Now,
reason underscoring common interpretation study
somehow blocks normal immune response, not really happening
here. Yes, reduction inflammatory cytokines increase anti-
inflammatory cytokines, not really thing blocking immune
response. just easily viewed enhancing immune response
combating intruder, case, E. coli. So, parse study little bit
closely. First all, magical pattern breathing? may
recognize so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim, course Dutchman. think
occupation online used listed daredevil, believe not, Wikipedia.
pretty cool occupation. Wim best known activities cold exposure, holds
multiple world records that, swimming icebergs incredible feats,
definitely don't want try unless extremely skilled really know
doing, does, also use breath work. breathing so-
called Wim Hof breathing similar, not exactly same, similar
Tummo breathing, described historically. science physiology
community laboratory, 'cause run university laboratory, refer
cyclic hyperventilation, just means repeated deep breaths out.
retentions. So, hot seat anyway, might well
demonstrate know looks like. variations this,
respect Wim, respect Tummo practitioners, respect cyclic
hyperventilators everywhere, one general theme it. involves 20 30 deep


inhales exhales mouth, followed exhale one's air
breath hold, retention. point, 15 60 seconds later,
repeating 25 30 breaths. again, breath hold lungs empty.
variations this, laboratory particular study, looks something
like this. Okay, not going whole thing right now, goes something like
this. [Andrew deeply breathing] Okay, assume 30 breaths. can
already feel perspiring little bit. heating up, release
adrenaline. caused breathing pattern, exhaling one's air, no
speaking like doing. [Andrew deeply exhaling] sitting lungs
empty one feels impulse breathe repeating several rounds, two
three even four rounds. Now people will also introduce big inhale
breath hold end find indeed can hold breath much longer
normally able to. trigger breathe normally activated
increases carbon dioxide blood. neurons brain stem
various regions brain, actually, respond carbon dioxide high
trigger reflex breathe. exhale deeply, blow off lot carbon
dioxide don't feel impulse breathe come quite soon. Basically study
looked people cyclic hyperventilation retention, 25 30 breaths,
retention, 25 30 breaths, retention, 25 30 breaths, retention.
So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various
duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,
get sick. Well, just experienced effect adrenaline,
epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,
order keep fighting combating infection. brings us larger theme,
stress combating infection wound not one unique system.
stress system use combat psychological stress.
very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline
epinephrin, actually better able combat infections reduce
inflammation whole feeling lousy response, right? Remember reduced flu-like
symptoms here. pattern breathing actually useful tool. confess,
use pattern breathing anytime initial stages getting sort
bug. feel like running ragged, somehow, whatever reason,
tickle throat, kind sensation nose, like might've
caught bug sort, will pattern breathing.
consistently, gosh, last four years more. Now just anecdotal reports,
find allows indeed either early symptoms disappear, allows
just kind push harder, longer. don't suggest people continue


push exposure infections. Obviously don't want infect people,
want crash suddenly get massive illness sort
stopped breathing. think useful tool. purely behavioral
intervention shown now additional studies way,
enhance function immune system reduce inflammation.
me, one concrete examples zero cost tool bridges activation
nervous system breathing immune system way releasing
adrenaline thereby reducing terrible effects feelings lousiness from,
case, E. coli infection. Now, like focus couple important points
haven't heard discussed broadly elsewhere, hyperventilation
breath retention important. can't simply hyperventilate get effect
level epinephrin release reduction inflammatory cytokines.
shown hyperventilation phase hypoxia, low oxygen
saturation due breath retention, combine increase epinephrin
adrenaline levels. So, 25 30 breaths, retention. 25
30 breaths retention, meaning exhale breath hold, order
get full effect. also want provide critical cautionary note. Don't
anywhere near water driving car. things might seem kind obvious,
obviously off chance black something like that,
disastrous. So, please careful. again, don't try push breath hold.
moment feel impulse breathe, just breathe. seem three
rounds 25 30 breaths

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine
systems, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like nucleus
accumbens, et cetera. reward system associated dopamine
norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological
pathways also specific protocols related mindset. guess simple way frame
say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie
notion can worry sick? discovered new pathway
able activate pathway independent worry stress see illness
occur, able inhibit pathway, block activity neural pathway
prevent psychogenic fever worrying oneself sick. So, able
controlled way. just mention pathway case want look
detail. corticolimbic pathway. So, just orient us, cortex
less outer shell brain. involved thinking sensation perceptions
learning maintenance lot memories stored there. hear
learn remember hippocampus, initial site learning
memory, information, believe not, passed off cortex
stored kind long-term hard drive type storage. corticolimbic pathway one
thoughts, prior experiences can literally structure way, feed
onto areas brain control basal processes, including temperature
regulation. corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway. talked earlier
hypothalamus controlling temperature lot sickness related behavior, right?
Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic
pathway, fancy name. dorsal peduncular cortex, dorsal tinea tecta.
short DP/DTT. just call DP/DTT, dorsomedial
hypothalamus. lot D's. shouldn't mean anything. doesn't really matter
call it. important conceptually pathway originates insights
brain associated thinking, emotion prior history, feeds
directly area brain involved basic physiological subconsciously
controlled processes. So, incredible, right? points physical pathway
way think something changes something core physiology.
Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something
excites you, heart rate can increase. think something terrifies you,
heart rate can increase. idea thinking controls physiology not
new concept all, somehow human beings, challenged idea
actually think sick. paper Kataoka shows
expose somebody psychological stress, can actually activate
pathway create fever. that? Well, can exposing


subjects stressful real event, cue associative learning.
So, maybe, like PILOT V5s, love much, traumatize
PILOT V5 horrible experience happen looking
concentrating PILOT V5. take away horrible experience, give
PILOT V5, start experience lot symptoms associated
terrible event. able using sickness inducing stimuli forth.
various derivations identified pathway activated, even
absence horrible event, create fever illness-like behavior
forth. blocked certain stations along neural pathway, block
effect. really concrete evidence, proof, will, dedicated
pathways mammalian brain, brain mine, allow us turn thoughts
illness.

01:37:00 Tool 8: Healthy Mindsets, Hope, Dopamine; Tool 9: Tyrosine; Tool 10: Cold
Exposure

kind depressing idea. inverse? turning thoughts
health? Well, work Asya Rolls. explored well-established
psychological phenomenon cancer patients ill people people
suffering debilitating injuries, people reported sense hope,
rates recovery much higher, right? Sounds subjective.
sense hope? sense hope sense future. sense future tightly
associated dopamine system. Dopamine, again, molecule reward
motivation movement, movement motivation things
beyond confines skin future.
discovered studies groups discovered
stimulation dopamine pathway, either simply thinking future, ideally
positive future, thinking positive future leads activation so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway reduce size tumors, accelerate
wound healing, greatly accelerate passage state illness state
health wellbeing. many, many studies now starting wick related
this. also idea augmenting dopamine system can increase
rate healing. so, individuals opt, instance, take
things increase dopamine. Now, obviously drugs abuse not good idea


context, even though increase dopamine, lead big crashes,
addictive properties, et cetera. talked podcast things like L-
tyrosine, taking anywhere 500 750 milligrams can increase dopamine
tyrosine dopamine precursor, course. Things like Mucuna pruriens, L-
dopa, immediate precursor dopamine. will lead somewhat
crash certain individuals. people tolerate little bit better. Again,
talk doctor, figure right you. bipolar
mania schizophrenia, things, not recommend all. not
recommending all, just mentioning potential exploration safe
right you. point this: dopamine system, activated can
accelerate healing, can accelerate recovery injury kinds.
shouldn't come mystery surprise result us. reward pathway
fact related sense future seems liberate entire systems
within body make inflammatory cytokines go down, anti-inflammatory
cytokines go up. Exactly demonstrated beautiful PNAS study
breathing, cyclic hyperventilation, used increase epinephrin, increase
norepinephrine, augment catecholamine system. So, think bridges
studies really relevant. one case, talking potentially
taking over-the-counter compound increase dopamine accelerate healing.
another case, talking using breathing. also use cold water
exposure increase dopamine. talked several episodes ago,
shown immersing oneself cold water neck so. cold? Well,
depends can tolerate, uncomfortably cold, not cold
become hypothermic, challenging get in, can stay three
10 minutes so, shown lead significant, doubling
baseline dopamine levels epinephrin levels go several hours. may
basis people will cold showers ice baths get sauna.
So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment
neurotransmitters. Today, talking neurotransmitters can
used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally
exposure cold water, instance, can done even just simply breathing
particular way, cyclic hyperventilation followed retention. catacholamines,


noradrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine bridge activation immune
system nervous system. way nervous system calls
immune system, "Aha, problem. need counter this." can
think them, meaning dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, able
deploy larger amounts immune cells,

01:42:05 You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis

types immune cells talked beginning episode. Okay,
thus far, discussing one can prevent getting sick one starts
feel ill, one might able shorten course infection ramping
activity immune system. already experiencing
symptoms? runny nose, stuffed nose, congestion, headache, et cetera. Well,
many ways address symptom level. probably aware
counter medications, many focus epinephrin system. Things
Sudafed variety prevent reduce congestion way
cause release epinephrin, effects dilating bronchioles
dilating nasal passages forth. not going speak whether not
good bad choices. couple effects not great
course treating underlying cause, first can cause dehydration.
make sure hydrating well, fluids electrolytes,
also can interfere sleep talked episodes sleep,
one hallmarks deep sleep particular REM sleep epinephrin,
adrenaline levels low. allows intense, often
emotionally-laden dreams REM sleep not act out. low adrenaline,
epinephrin REM sleep basically signature, neurochemical signature
REM sleep state, vital emotional physical repair forth. So,
fact can inhibit sleep, fact can cause dehydration, fact can
make people feel kind lightheaded jittery makes not terrific choices
number people. interesting alternative choice. say alternative,
mean alternative. choice referring spirulina, actually
form algae. Years ago, think first heard spirulina, sounded much
kind 1970s, 80s health food store variety. seemed really kind mystical
wacky, actually now really nice studies data, also


understanding mechanism spirulina can potent effects reducing
called rhinitis, fancy word congestion nose
inflammation nose. Basically, anytime hear word includes "itis," least
medical health context, generally means inflammation tissue.
rhinitis just inflammation nasal passages, one
uncomfortable symptoms kind infection. two studies like
highlight just quickly. One effects spirulina allergic rhinitis.
clinical comparison efficacy spirulina platensis, technical name,
cetirizine treatment allergic rhinitis. looked humans, not
mouse study, study humans. sexes, males females. one
case, looking 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects. other, 65 subjects, decent
number subjects, randomized trial, double blind. cases saw significant decreases
nasal obstruction, improved ability smell, improved sleep, daily working
inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,
region hind brain back brain kind near neck
medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal
prominent "Nature" featuring upfront, think really mark
beginning new path medicine. just underscore point little bit further,
National Institutes Health, course cancer institute, eye institute,
deal trying combat cancer cure blindness forth. now
called NCCIH, complimentary health. so, good tax
dollars put kinds explorations talking undoubtedly
going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times
hope learning new emerging science hearing
protocols either zero cost low cost, certainly respiration
case use heat cold, maybe even electroacupuncture
access that, can really see starting evolve field health
medicine science ancient practices, really starting converge

question every good scientist, two year old health information seeker asks,
why? How? world work? work? Well make
long story shortish, going go depth here, reason works
sympathetic nervous system, so-called stress part nervous
system, not really called that, part nervous system triggers stress
mild stress, severe stress, even panic, causes release adrenaline

sort invading infection, body able push back that, resist engaging

course. behavioral protocol people deliberately employing allows

normal pathways immune system function enhanced. Okay? Now,
reason underscoring common interpretation study
somehow blocks normal immune response, not really happening
here. Yes, reduction inflammatory cytokines increase anti-
inflammatory cytokines, not really thing blocking immune
response. just easily viewed enhancing immune response
combating intruder, case, E. coli. So, parse study little bit
closely. First all, magical pattern breathing? may
recognize so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim, course Dutchman. think
occupation online used listed daredevil, believe not, Wikipedia.
pretty cool occupation. Wim best known activities cold exposure, holds
multiple world records that, swimming icebergs incredible feats,
definitely don't want try unless extremely skilled really know
doing, does, also use breath work. breathing so-
called Wim Hof breathing similar, not exactly same, similar
Tummo breathing, described historically. science physiology
community laboratory, 'cause run university laboratory, refer
cyclic hyperventilation, just means repeated deep breaths out.
retentions. So, hot seat anyway, might well
demonstrate know looks like. variations this,
respect Wim, respect Tummo practitioners, respect cyclic
hyperventilators everywhere, one general theme it. involves 20 30 deep


inhales exhales mouth, followed exhale one's air
breath hold, retention. point, 15 60 seconds later,
repeating 25 30 breaths. again, breath hold lungs empty.
variations this, laboratory particular study, looks something
like this. Okay, not going whole thing right now, goes something like
this. [Andrew deeply breathing] Okay, assume 30 breaths. can
already feel perspiring little bit. heating up, release
adrenaline. caused breathing pattern, exhaling one's air, no
speaking like doing. [Andrew deeply exhaling] sitting lungs
empty one feels impulse breathe repeating several rounds, two
three even four rounds. Now people will also introduce big inhale
breath hold end find indeed can hold breath much longer
normally able to. trigger breathe normally activated
increases carbon dioxide blood. neurons brain stem
various regions brain, actually, respond carbon dioxide high
trigger reflex breathe. exhale deeply, blow off lot carbon
dioxide don't feel impulse breathe come quite soon. Basically study
looked people cyclic hyperventilation retention, 25 30 breaths,
retention, 25 30 breaths, retention, 25 30 breaths, retention.
So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various
duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,
get sick. Well, just experienced effect adrenaline,
epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,
order keep fighting combating infection. brings us larger theme,
stress combating infection wound not one unique system.
stress system use combat psychological stress.
very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline
epinephrin, actually better able combat infections reduce
inflammation whole feeling lousy response, right? Remember reduced flu-like
symptoms here. pattern breathing actually useful tool. confess,
use pattern breathing anytime initial stages getting sort
bug. feel like running ragged, somehow, whatever reason,
tickle throat, kind sensation nose, like might've
caught bug sort, will pattern breathing.
consistently, gosh, last four years more. Now just anecdotal reports,
find allows indeed either early symptoms disappear, allows
just kind push harder, longer. don't suggest people continue


push exposure infections. Obviously don't want infect people,
want crash suddenly get massive illness sort
stopped breathing. think useful tool. purely behavioral
intervention shown now additional studies way,
enhance function immune system reduce inflammation.
me, one concrete examples zero cost tool bridges activation
nervous system breathing immune system way releasing
adrenaline thereby reducing terrible effects feelings lousiness from,
case, E. coli infection. Now, like focus couple important points
haven't heard discussed broadly elsewhere, hyperventilation
breath retention important. can't simply hyperventilate get effect

shown hyperventilation phase hypoxia, low oxygen
saturation due breath retention, combine increase epinephrin

30 breaths retention, meaning exhale breath hold, order
get full effect. also want provide critical cautionary note. Don't
anywhere near water driving car. things might seem kind obvious,
obviously off chance black something like that,
disastrous. So, please careful. again, don't try push breath hold.
moment feel impulse breathe, just breathe. seem three
rounds 25 30 breaths

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental

essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine

accumbens, et cetera. reward system associated dopamine
norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,

medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal
prominent "Nature" featuring upfront, think really mark
beginning new path medicine. just underscore point little bit further,
National Institutes Health, course cancer institute, eye institute,
deal trying combat cancer cure blindness forth. now
called NCCIH, complimentary health. so, good tax
dollars put kinds explorations talking undoubtedly
going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times
hope learning new emerging science hearing

question every good scientist, two year old health information seeker asks,
why? How? world work? work? Well make
long story shortish, going go depth here, reason works
sympathetic nervous system, so-called stress part nervous
system, not really called that, part nervous system triggers stress
mild stress, severe stress, even panic, causes release adrenaline
epinephrin brain body. normal circumstances,
sort invading infection, body able push back that, resist engaging
stress response. happening behavioral protocol involving
nervous system, 'cause behaviors generated nervous system
course. behavioral protocol people deliberately employing allows
activate sympathetic nervous system, turn allows activate
normal pathways immune system function enhanced. Okay? Now,
reason underscoring common interpretation study
somehow blocks normal immune response, not really happening
here. Yes, reduction inflammatory cytokines increase anti-
inflammatory cytokines, not really thing blocking immune
response. just easily viewed enhancing immune response
combating intruder, case, E. coli. So, parse study little bit
closely. First all, magical pattern breathing? may
recognize so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim, course Dutchman. think
occupation online used listed daredevil, believe not, Wikipedia.
pretty cool occupation. Wim best known activities cold exposure, holds
multiple world records that, swimming icebergs incredible feats,
definitely don't want try unless extremely skilled really know
doing, does, also use breath work. breathing so-
called Wim Hof breathing similar, not exactly same, similar
Tummo breathing, described historically. science physiology
community laboratory, 'cause run university laboratory, refer
cyclic hyperventilation, just means repeated deep breaths out.
retentions. So, hot seat anyway, might well
demonstrate know looks like. variations this,
respect Wim, respect Tummo practitioners, respect cyclic
hyperventilators everywhere, one general theme it. involves 20 30 deep


inhales exhales mouth, followed exhale one's air
breath hold, retention. point, 15 60 seconds later,
repeating 25 30 breaths. again, breath hold lungs empty.
variations this, laboratory particular study, looks something
like this. Okay, not going whole thing right now, goes something like
this. [Andrew deeply breathing] Okay, assume 30 breaths. can
already feel perspiring little bit. heating up, release
adrenaline. caused breathing pattern, exhaling one's air, no
speaking like doing. [Andrew deeply exhaling] sitting lungs
empty one feels impulse breathe repeating several rounds, two
three even four rounds. Now people will also introduce big inhale
breath hold end find indeed can hold breath much longer
normally able to. trigger breathe normally activated
increases carbon dioxide blood. neurons brain stem
various regions brain, actually, respond carbon dioxide high
trigger reflex breathe. exhale deeply, blow off lot carbon
dioxide don't feel impulse breathe come quite soon. Basically study
looked people cyclic hyperventilation retention, 25 30 breaths,
retention, 25 30 breaths, retention, 25 30 breaths, retention.
So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various
duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,
get sick. Well, just experienced effect adrenaline,
epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,
order keep fighting combating infection. brings us larger theme,
stress combating infection wound not one unique system.
stress system use combat psychological stress.
very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline
epinephrin, actually better able combat infections reduce
inflammation whole feeling lousy response, right? Remember reduced flu-like
symptoms here. pattern breathing actually useful tool. confess,
use pattern breathing anytime initial stages getting sort
bug. feel like running ragged, somehow, whatever reason,
tickle throat, kind sensation nose, like might've
caught bug sort, will pattern breathing.
consistently, gosh, last four years more. Now just anecdotal reports,
find allows indeed either early symptoms disappear, allows
just kind push harder, longer. don't suggest people continue


push exposure infections. Obviously don't want infect people,
want crash suddenly get massive illness sort
stopped breathing. think useful tool. purely behavioral
intervention shown now additional studies way,
enhance function immune system reduce inflammation.
me, one concrete examples zero cost tool bridges activation
nervous system breathing immune system way releasing
adrenaline thereby reducing terrible effects feelings lousiness from,
case, E. coli infection. Now, like focus couple important points
haven't heard discussed broadly elsewhere, hyperventilation
breath retention important. can't simply hyperventilate get effect
level epinephrin release reduction inflammatory cytokines.
shown hyperventilation phase hypoxia, low oxygen
saturation due breath retention, combine increase epinephrin
adrenaline levels. So, 25 30 breaths, retention. 25
30 breaths retention, meaning exhale breath hold, order
get full effect. also want provide critical cautionary note. Don't
anywhere near water driving car. things might seem kind obvious,
obviously off chance black something like that,
disastrous. So, please careful. again, don't try push breath hold.
moment feel impulse breathe, just breathe. seem three
rounds 25 30 breaths

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine
systems, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like nucleus
accumbens, et cetera. reward system associated dopamine
norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological
pathways also specific protocols related mindset. guess simple way frame
say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie
notion can worry sick? discovered new pathway
able activate pathway independent worry stress see illness
occur, able inhibit pathway, block activity neural pathway
prevent psychogenic fever worrying oneself sick. So, able
controlled way. just mention pathway case want look
detail. corticolimbic pathway. So, just orient us, cortex
less outer shell brain. involved thinking sensation perceptions
learning maintenance lot memories stored there. hear
learn remember hippocampus, initial site learning
memory, information, believe not, passed off cortex
stored kind long-term hard drive type storage. corticolimbic pathway one
thoughts, prior experiences can literally structure way, feed
onto areas brain control basal processes, including temperature
regulation. corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway. talked earlier
hypothalamus controlling temperature lot sickness related behavior, right?
Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic
pathway, fancy name. dorsal peduncular cortex, dorsal tinea tecta.
short DP/DTT. just call DP/DTT, dorsomedial
hypothalamus. lot D's. shouldn't mean anything. doesn't really matter
call it. important conceptually pathway originates insights
brain associated thinking, emotion prior history, feeds
directly area brain involved basic physiological subconsciously
controlled processes. So, incredible, right? points physical pathway
way think something changes something core physiology.
Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something
excites you, heart rate can increase. think something terrifies you,
heart rate can increase. idea thinking controls physiology not
new concept all, somehow human beings, challenged idea
actually think sick. paper Kataoka shows
expose somebody psychological stress, can actually activate
pathway create fever. that? Well, can exposing


subjects stressful real event, cue associative learning.
So, maybe, like PILOT V5s, love much, traumatize
PILOT V5 horrible experience happen looking
concentrating PILOT V5. take away horrible experience, give
PILOT V5, start experience lot symptoms associated
terrible event. able using sickness inducing stimuli forth.
various derivations identified pathway activated, even
absence horrible event, create fever illness-like behavior
forth. blocked certain stations along neural pathway, block
effect. really concrete evidence, proof, will, dedicated
pathways mammalian brain, brain mine, allow us turn thoughts

inhales exhales mouth, followed exhale one's air
breath hold, retention. point, 15 60 seconds later,
repeating 25 30 breaths. again, breath hold lungs empty.
variations this, laboratory particular study, looks something
like this. Okay, not going whole thing right now, goes something like
this. [Andrew deeply breathing] Okay, assume 30 breaths. can
already feel perspiring little bit. heating up, release
adrenaline. caused breathing pattern, exhaling one's air, no
speaking like doing. [Andrew deeply exhaling] sitting lungs
empty one feels impulse breathe repeating several rounds, two
three even four rounds. Now people will also introduce big inhale
breath hold end find indeed can hold breath much longer
normally able to. trigger breathe normally activated
increases carbon dioxide blood. neurons brain stem
various regions brain, actually, respond carbon dioxide high
trigger reflex breathe. exhale deeply, blow off lot carbon
dioxide don't feel impulse breathe come quite soon. Basically study
looked people cyclic hyperventilation retention, 25 30 breaths,
retention, 25 30 breaths, retention, 25 30 breaths, retention.
So, three rounds 25 30 breaths followed exhale, hold various
duration. general, 15 60 seconds typical. happened physiologically?
one reasons like study. happened physiologically? Well,
couple things. course, blood oxygenation drops. expect based
hyperventilation especially based exhale much carbon dioxide.
explain is, blood levels oxygen drop. pH, alkalinity
body goes way up. interesting. look paper, can look
Figure One, Panel C, pH goes way up. People become alkaline. heard
alkaline water. hate say this, probably lose friends this, yeah, don't
waste money drinking alkaline water. can't really shift alkalinity
body. cases compartment body needs alkaline
rest. gut different alkalinity areas body, et cetera,
ingesting high alkaline water isn't going shift overall alkalinity. someone can
send quality reference shows different happy revise statement.
case, pattern breathing just described greatly increases


pH. Greatly, say, doesn't send off dangerous levels. takes 7.4
7.6, significant increase alkalinity. So, pH levels,
remember high school college chemistry, numbers pH go down,
becoming acidic, go up, becoming alkaline, okay
basic. So, subjects went 7.4 7.6 breathing, afterwards
returned normal. shift alkalinity thought important here. So,
going here? breathing leading shifts in... say reduction
inflammatory cytokines increase liberation anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Well, authors make good arguments not shift pH
per se, shift carbon dioxide levels blood, rather release
epinephrin. good reason believe case. beyond
scope discussion, actually release epinephrin, AKA adrenaline,
causing reduction inflammation. actually supported something
probably experienced before, ever worked, worked,
worked, worked, worked really hard, caretaker somebody else
studying exams, people around getting sick just powering
not getting sick, stop, turn final exam,
stopped taking care somebody else, finally stop rest go vacation,
get sick. Well, just experienced effect adrenaline,
epinephrin can activating immune system way nervous system,
order keep fighting combating infection. brings us larger theme,
stress combating infection wound not one unique system.
stress system use combat psychological stress.
very, stressed, least short term, release much adrenaline
epinephrin, actually better able combat infections reduce
inflammation whole feeling lousy response, right? Remember reduced flu-like
symptoms here. pattern breathing actually useful tool. confess,
use pattern breathing anytime initial stages getting sort
bug. feel like running ragged, somehow, whatever reason,
tickle throat, kind sensation nose, like might've
caught bug sort, will pattern breathing.
consistently, gosh, last four years more. Now just anecdotal reports,
find allows indeed either early symptoms disappear, allows
just kind push harder, longer. don't suggest people continue


push exposure infections. Obviously don't want infect people,
want crash suddenly get massive illness sort
stopped breathing. think useful tool. purely behavioral
intervention shown now additional studies way,
enhance function immune system reduce inflammation.
me, one concrete examples zero cost tool bridges activation
nervous system breathing immune system way releasing
adrenaline thereby reducing terrible effects feelings lousiness from,
case, E. coli infection. Now, like focus couple important points
haven't heard discussed broadly elsewhere, hyperventilation
breath retention important. can't simply hyperventilate get effect
level epinephrin release reduction inflammatory cytokines.
shown hyperventilation phase hypoxia, low oxygen
saturation due breath retention, combine increase epinephrin
adrenaline levels. So, 25 30 breaths, retention. 25
30 breaths retention, meaning exhale breath hold, order
get full effect. also want provide critical cautionary note. Don't
anywhere near water driving car. things might seem kind obvious,
obviously off chance black something like that,
disastrous. So, please careful. again, don't try push breath hold.
moment feel impulse breathe, just breathe. seem three
rounds 25 30 breaths

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine
systems, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like nucleus
accumbens, et cetera. reward system associated dopamine
norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological
pathways also specific protocols related mindset. guess simple way frame
say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie
notion can worry sick? discovered new pathway
able activate pathway independent worry stress see illness
occur, able inhibit pathway, block activity neural pathway
prevent psychogenic fever worrying oneself sick. So, able
controlled way. just mention pathway case want look
detail. corticolimbic pathway. So, just orient us, cortex
less outer shell brain. involved thinking sensation perceptions
learning maintenance lot memories stored there. hear
learn remember hippocampus, initial site learning
memory, information, believe not, passed off cortex
stored kind long-term hard drive type storage. corticolimbic pathway one
thoughts, prior experiences can literally structure way, feed
onto areas brain control basal processes, including temperature
regulation. corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway. talked earlier
hypothalamus controlling temperature lot sickness related behavior, right?
Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic
pathway, fancy name. dorsal peduncular cortex, dorsal tinea tecta.
short DP/DTT. just call DP/DTT, dorsomedial
hypothalamus. lot D's. shouldn't mean anything. doesn't really matter
call it. important conceptually pathway originates insights
brain associated thinking, emotion prior history, feeds
directly area brain involved basic physiological subconsciously
controlled processes. So, incredible, right? points physical pathway
way think something changes something core physiology.
Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something
excites you, heart rate can increase. think something terrifies you,
heart rate can increase. idea thinking controls physiology not
new concept all, somehow human beings, challenged idea
actually think sick. paper Kataoka shows
expose somebody psychological stress, can actually activate
pathway create fever. that? Well, can exposing


subjects stressful real event, cue associative learning.
So, maybe, like PILOT V5s, love much, traumatize
PILOT V5 horrible experience happen looking
concentrating PILOT V5. take away horrible experience, give
PILOT V5, start experience lot symptoms associated
terrible event. able using sickness inducing stimuli forth.
various derivations identified pathway activated, even
absence horrible event, create fever illness-like behavior
forth. blocked certain stations along neural pathway, block
effect. really concrete evidence, proof, will, dedicated
pathways mammalian brain, brain mine, allow us turn thoughts
illness.

01:37:00 Tool 8: Healthy Mindsets, Hope, Dopamine; Tool 9: Tyrosine; Tool 10: Cold
Exposure

kind depressing idea. inverse? turning thoughts
health? Well, work Asya Rolls. explored well-established
psychological phenomenon cancer patients ill people people
suffering debilitating injuries, people reported sense hope,
rates recovery much higher, right? Sounds subjective.
sense hope? sense hope sense future. sense future tightly
associated dopamine system. Dopamine, again, molecule reward
motivation movement, movement motivation things
beyond confines skin future.
discovered studies groups discovered
stimulation dopamine pathway, either simply thinking future, ideally
positive future, thinking positive future leads activation so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway reduce size tumors, accelerate
wound healing, greatly accelerate passage state illness state
health wellbeing. many, many studies now starting wick related
this. also idea augmenting dopamine system can increase
rate healing. so, individuals opt, instance, take
things increase dopamine. Now, obviously drugs abuse not good idea


context, even though increase dopamine, lead big crashes,
addictive properties, et cetera. talked podcast things like L-
tyrosine, taking anywhere 500 750 milligrams can increase dopamine
tyrosine dopamine precursor, course. Things like Mucuna pruriens, L-
dopa, immediate precursor dopamine. will lead somewhat
crash certain individuals. people tolerate little bit better. Again,
talk doctor, figure right you. bipolar
mania schizophrenia, things, not recommend all. not
recommending all, just mentioning potential exploration safe
right you. point this: dopamine system, activated can
accelerate healing, can accelerate recovery injury kinds.
shouldn't come mystery surprise result us. reward pathway
fact related sense future seems liberate entire systems
within body make inflammatory cytokines go down, anti-inflammatory
cytokines go up. Exactly demonstrated beautiful PNAS study
breathing, cyclic hyperventilation, used increase epinephrin, increase
norepinephrine, augment catecholamine system. So, think bridges
studies really relevant. one case, talking potentially
taking over-the-counter compound increase dopamine accelerate healing.
another case, talking using breathing. also use cold water
exposure increase dopamine. talked several episodes ago,
shown immersing oneself cold water neck so. cold? Well,
depends can tolerate, uncomfortably cold, not cold
become hypothermic, challenging get in, can stay three
10 minutes so, shown lead significant, doubling
baseline dopamine levels epinephrin levels go several hours. may
basis people will cold showers ice baths get sauna.
So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment
neurotransmitters. Today, talking neurotransmitters can
used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally
exposure cold water, instance, can done even just simply breathing
particular way, cyclic hyperventilation followed retention. catacholamines,


noradrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine bridge activation immune
system nervous system. way nervous system calls
immune system, "Aha, problem. need counter this." can
think them, meaning dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, able
deploy larger amounts immune cells,

01:42:05 You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis

types immune cells talked beginning episode. Okay,
thus far, discussing one can prevent getting sick one starts
feel ill, one might able shorten course infection ramping
activity immune system. already experiencing
symptoms? runny nose, stuffed nose, congestion, headache, et cetera. Well,
many ways address symptom level. probably aware
counter medications, many focus epinephrin system. Things
Sudafed variety prevent reduce congestion way
cause release epinephrin, effects dilating bronchioles
dilating nasal passages forth. not going speak whether not
good bad choices. couple effects not great
course treating underlying cause, first can cause dehydration.
make sure hydrating well, fluids electrolytes,
also can interfere sleep talked episodes sleep,
one hallmarks deep sleep particular REM sleep epinephrin,
adrenaline levels low. allows intense, often
emotionally-laden dreams REM sleep not act out. low adrenaline,
epinephrin REM sleep basically signature, neurochemical signature
REM sleep state, vital emotional physical repair forth. So,
fact can inhibit sleep, fact can cause dehydration, fact can
make people feel kind lightheaded jittery makes not terrific choices
number people. interesting alternative choice. say alternative,
mean alternative. choice referring spirulina, actually
form algae. Years ago, think first heard spirulina, sounded much
kind 1970s, 80s health food store variety. seemed really kind mystical
wacky, actually now really nice studies data, also


understanding mechanism spirulina can potent effects reducing
called rhinitis, fancy word congestion nose
inflammation nose. Basically, anytime hear word includes "itis," least
medical health context, generally means inflammation tissue.
rhinitis just inflammation nasal passages, one
uncomfortable symptoms kind infection. two studies like
highlight just quickly. One effects spirulina allergic rhinitis.
clinical comparison efficacy spirulina platensis, technical name,
cetirizine treatment allergic rhinitis. looked humans, not
mouse study, study humans. sexes, males females. one
case, looking 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects. other, 65 subjects, decent
number subjects, randomized trial, double blind. cases saw significant decreases
nasal obstruction, improved ability smell, improved sleep, daily working
inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally

pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis

probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked

01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine

breath hold retentions ideal protocol. one last
interesting feature study want emphasize. actually
measured so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines things like
dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. chemicals nervous system
body promote states alertness, dopamine, course, part reward
motivation pathways. explored levels molecules blood, plasma
breathing protocol. interesting, mentioned before,
epinephrin showed robust increases compared control group, norepinephrine,
significant increases occurred breathing group, cyclic hyperventilation


retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine
systems, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like nucleus
accumbens, et cetera. reward system associated dopamine
norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological
pathways also specific protocols related mindset. guess simple way frame
say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie
notion can worry sick? discovered new pathway
able activate pathway independent worry stress see illness
occur, able inhibit pathway, block activity neural pathway
prevent psychogenic fever worrying oneself sick. So, able
controlled way. just mention pathway case want look
detail. corticolimbic pathway. So, just orient us, cortex
less outer shell brain. involved thinking sensation perceptions
learning maintenance lot memories stored there. hear
learn remember hippocampus, initial site learning
memory, information, believe not, passed off cortex
stored kind long-term hard drive type storage. corticolimbic pathway one
thoughts, prior experiences can literally structure way, feed
onto areas brain control basal processes, including temperature
regulation. corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway. talked earlier
hypothalamus controlling temperature lot sickness related behavior, right?
Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic
pathway, fancy name. dorsal peduncular cortex, dorsal tinea tecta.
short DP/DTT. just call DP/DTT, dorsomedial
hypothalamus. lot D's. shouldn't mean anything. doesn't really matter
call it. important conceptually pathway originates insights
brain associated thinking, emotion prior history, feeds
directly area brain involved basic physiological subconsciously
controlled processes. So, incredible, right? points physical pathway
way think something changes something core physiology.
Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something
excites you, heart rate can increase. think something terrifies you,
heart rate can increase. idea thinking controls physiology not
new concept all, somehow human beings, challenged idea
actually think sick. paper Kataoka shows
expose somebody psychological stress, can actually activate
pathway create fever. that? Well, can exposing


subjects stressful real event, cue associative learning.
So, maybe, like PILOT V5s, love much, traumatize
PILOT V5 horrible experience happen looking
concentrating PILOT V5. take away horrible experience, give
PILOT V5, start experience lot symptoms associated
terrible event. able using sickness inducing stimuli forth.
various derivations identified pathway activated, even
absence horrible event, create fever illness-like behavior
forth. blocked certain stations along neural pathway, block
effect. really concrete evidence, proof, will, dedicated
pathways mammalian brain, brain mine, allow us turn thoughts
illness.

01:37:00 Tool 8: Healthy Mindsets, Hope, Dopamine; Tool 9: Tyrosine; Tool 10: Cold
Exposure

kind depressing idea. inverse? turning thoughts
health? Well, work Asya Rolls. explored well-established
psychological phenomenon cancer patients ill people people
suffering debilitating injuries, people reported sense hope,
rates recovery much higher, right? Sounds subjective.
sense hope? sense hope sense future. sense future tightly
associated dopamine system. Dopamine, again, molecule reward
motivation movement, movement motivation things
beyond confines skin future.
discovered studies groups discovered
stimulation dopamine pathway, either simply thinking future, ideally
positive future, thinking positive future leads activation so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway reduce size tumors, accelerate
wound healing, greatly accelerate passage state illness state
health wellbeing. many, many studies now starting wick related
this. also idea augmenting dopamine system can increase
rate healing. so, individuals opt, instance, take
things increase dopamine. Now, obviously drugs abuse not good idea


context, even though increase dopamine, lead big crashes,
addictive properties, et cetera. talked podcast things like L-
tyrosine, taking anywhere 500 750 milligrams can increase dopamine
tyrosine dopamine precursor, course. Things like Mucuna pruriens, L-
dopa, immediate precursor dopamine. will lead somewhat
crash certain individuals. people tolerate little bit better. Again,
talk doctor, figure right you. bipolar
mania schizophrenia, things, not recommend all. not
recommending all, just mentioning potential exploration safe
right you. point this: dopamine system, activated can
accelerate healing, can accelerate recovery injury kinds.
shouldn't come mystery surprise result us. reward pathway
fact related sense future seems liberate entire systems
within body make inflammatory cytokines go down, anti-inflammatory
cytokines go up. Exactly demonstrated beautiful PNAS study
breathing, cyclic hyperventilation, used increase epinephrin, increase
norepinephrine, augment catecholamine system. So, think bridges
studies really relevant. one case, talking potentially
taking over-the-counter compound increase dopamine accelerate healing.
another case, talking using breathing. also use cold water
exposure increase dopamine. talked several episodes ago,
shown immersing oneself cold water neck so. cold? Well,
depends can tolerate, uncomfortably cold, not cold
become hypothermic, challenging get in, can stay three
10 minutes so, shown lead significant, doubling
baseline dopamine levels epinephrin levels go several hours. may
basis people will cold showers ice baths get sauna.
So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment
neurotransmitters. Today, talking neurotransmitters can
used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally
exposure cold water, instance, can done even just simply breathing
particular way, cyclic hyperventilation followed retention. catacholamines,


noradrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine bridge activation immune
system nervous system. way nervous system calls
immune system, "Aha, problem. need counter this." can
think them, meaning dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, able
deploy larger amounts immune cells,

01:42:05 You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis

types immune cells talked beginning episode. Okay,
thus far, discussing one can prevent getting sick one starts
feel ill, one might able shorten course infection ramping
activity immune system. already experiencing
symptoms? runny nose, stuffed nose, congestion, headache, et cetera. Well,
many ways address symptom level. probably aware
counter medications, many focus epinephrin system. Things
Sudafed variety prevent reduce congestion way
cause release epinephrin, effects dilating bronchioles
dilating nasal passages forth. not going speak whether not
good bad choices. couple effects not great
course treating underlying cause, first can cause dehydration.
make sure hydrating well, fluids electrolytes,
also can interfere sleep talked episodes sleep,
one hallmarks deep sleep particular REM sleep epinephrin,
adrenaline levels low. allows intense, often
emotionally-laden dreams REM sleep not act out. low adrenaline,
epinephrin REM sleep basically signature, neurochemical signature
REM sleep state, vital emotional physical repair forth. So,
fact can inhibit sleep, fact can cause dehydration, fact can
make people feel kind lightheaded jittery makes not terrific choices
number people. interesting alternative choice. say alternative,
mean alternative. choice referring spirulina, actually
form algae. Years ago, think first heard spirulina, sounded much
kind 1970s, 80s health food store variety. seemed really kind mystical
wacky, actually now really nice studies data, also


understanding mechanism spirulina can potent effects reducing
called rhinitis, fancy word congestion nose
inflammation nose. Basically, anytime hear word includes "itis," least
medical health context, generally means inflammation tissue.
rhinitis just inflammation nasal passages, one
uncomfortable symptoms kind infection. two studies like
highlight just quickly. One effects spirulina allergic rhinitis.
clinical comparison efficacy spirulina platensis, technical name,
cetirizine treatment allergic rhinitis. looked humans, not
mouse study, study humans. sexes, males females. one
case, looking 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects. other, 65 subjects, decent
number subjects, randomized trial, double blind. cases saw significant decreases
nasal obstruction, improved ability smell, improved sleep, daily working
inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,
region hind brain back brain kind near neck
medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal
prominent "Nature" featuring upfront, think really mark
beginning new path medicine. just underscore point little bit further,
National Institutes Health, course cancer institute, eye institute,
deal trying combat cancer cure blindness forth. now
called NCCIH, complimentary health. so, good tax
dollars put kinds explorations talking undoubtedly
going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times
hope learning new emerging science hearing

vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,
region hind brain back brain kind near neck
medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not
want take science erase previous tools methods
ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people
benefited it. So, think wonderful. Breath work respiration work
something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like
total... know, like just figment imagination, actually mechanism,
published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start
emerge. understanding mechanisms pathways, able
understand base set practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture,
forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
specific protocols. So, just delighted. Again, nothing work,
really terrific work, Qiufu colleagues. also want acknowledge journal
prominent "Nature" featuring upfront, think really mark
beginning new path medicine. just underscore point little bit further,
National Institutes Health, course cancer institute, eye institute,
deal trying combat cancer cure blindness forth. now
called NCCIH, complimentary health. so, good tax
dollars put kinds explorations talking undoubtedly
going lead better treatments immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
convergence immune system nervous system. exciting times
hope learning new emerging science hearing
protocols either zero cost low cost, certainly respiration
case use heat cold, maybe even electroacupuncture
access that, can really see starting evolve field health
medicine science ancient practices, really starting converge

retention breathing group, course, less so. dopamine levels actually dropped
somewhat. interesting new emerging literature
largely Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab Israel. laboratory shown
motivational state mindset powerful impact various aspects immune
system thought independent brain mind thinking.
brings us back something discussed beginning episode,
20, 30 years ago, idea heal body mind
considered kind quackery. think intervening period now
people might've said, "sure, stressed out, going make things
worse." mean, think everyone agrees stress makes every thing worse
level, outcomes neurodegeneration, performance physical endeavors mental
endeavors. stress high long people experience different challenges
essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, short term,
stress can actually beneficial ways just described. stress,
break really neurochemical state, right? release
catacholamines. Asya Rolls' laboratory shown so-called
dopamine system several episodes, described multiple dopamine
systems, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like nucleus
accumbens, et cetera. reward system associated dopamine
norepinephrine activated, see incredible effects, including instance, highly
significant reduction tumor size cancers. Now, be?
mindset, dopamine tumors, tumor growth somehow linked?

01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, Can Worry Sick

now know occurs largely incredible work Asya Rolls
others. So, now like turn focus specifically certain mindsets
impact immune system ways can actually point specific biological
pathways also specific protocols related mindset. guess simple way frame
say us aware yes, indeed, can worry
sick. told that, going worry sick. actually
paper published "Science," again, one top three journals there,
top three really "Nature," "Science," "Cell." course,
excellent journals exist, paper came "Science" last year. First


author Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress fever.
looking asking question, areas brain actually underlie
notion can worry sick? discovered new pathway
able activate pathway independent worry stress see illness
occur, able inhibit pathway, block activity neural pathway
prevent psychogenic fever worrying oneself sick. So, able
controlled way. just mention pathway case want look
detail. corticolimbic pathway. So, just orient us, cortex
less outer shell brain. involved thinking sensation perceptions
learning maintenance lot memories stored there. hear
learn remember hippocampus, initial site learning
memory, information, believe not, passed off cortex
stored kind long-term hard drive type storage. corticolimbic pathway one
thoughts, prior experiences can literally structure way, feed
onto areas brain control basal processes, including temperature
regulation. corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway. talked earlier
hypothalamus controlling temperature lot sickness related behavior, right?
Remember vagus hypothalamus sleep more, less appetite, fever.
Okay, hypothalamus. top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic
pathway, fancy name. dorsal peduncular cortex, dorsal tinea tecta.
short DP/DTT. just call DP/DTT, dorsomedial
hypothalamus. lot D's. shouldn't mean anything. doesn't really matter
call it. important conceptually pathway originates insights
brain associated thinking, emotion prior history, feeds
directly area brain involved basic physiological subconsciously
controlled processes. So, incredible, right? points physical pathway
way think something changes something core physiology.
Now, ways shouldn't surprising, right? think something
excites you, heart rate can increase. think something terrifies you,
heart rate can increase. idea thinking controls physiology not
new concept all, somehow human beings, challenged idea
actually think sick. paper Kataoka shows
expose somebody psychological stress, can actually activate
pathway create fever. that? Well, can exposing


subjects stressful real event, cue associative learning.
So, maybe, like PILOT V5s, love much, traumatize
PILOT V5 horrible experience happen looking
concentrating PILOT V5. take away horrible experience, give
PILOT V5, start experience lot symptoms associated
terrible event. able using sickness inducing stimuli forth.
various derivations identified pathway activated, even
absence horrible event, create fever illness-like behavior
forth. blocked certain stations along neural pathway, block
effect. really concrete evidence, proof, will, dedicated
pathways mammalian brain, brain mine, allow us turn thoughts
illness.

01:37:00 Tool 8: Healthy Mindsets, Hope, Dopamine; Tool 9: Tyrosine; Tool 10: Cold
Exposure

kind depressing idea. inverse? turning thoughts
health? Well, work Asya Rolls. explored well-established
psychological phenomenon cancer patients ill people people
suffering debilitating injuries, people reported sense hope,
rates recovery much higher, right? Sounds subjective.
sense hope? sense hope sense future. sense future tightly
associated dopamine system. Dopamine, again, molecule reward
motivation movement, movement motivation things
beyond confines skin future.
discovered studies groups discovered
stimulation dopamine pathway, either simply thinking future, ideally
positive future, thinking positive future leads activation so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway reduce size tumors, accelerate
wound healing, greatly accelerate passage state illness state
health wellbeing. many, many studies now starting wick related
this. also idea augmenting dopamine system can increase
rate healing. so, individuals opt, instance, take
things increase dopamine. Now, obviously drugs abuse not good idea


context, even though increase dopamine, lead big crashes,
addictive properties, et cetera. talked podcast things like L-
tyrosine, taking anywhere 500 750 milligrams can increase dopamine
tyrosine dopamine precursor, course. Things like Mucuna pruriens, L-
dopa, immediate precursor dopamine. will lead somewhat
crash certain individuals. people tolerate little bit better. Again,
talk doctor, figure right you. bipolar
mania schizophrenia, things, not recommend all. not
recommending all, just mentioning potential exploration safe
right you. point this: dopamine system, activated can
accelerate healing, can accelerate recovery injury kinds.
shouldn't come mystery surprise result us. reward pathway
fact related sense future seems liberate entire systems
within body make inflammatory cytokines go down, anti-inflammatory
cytokines go up. Exactly demonstrated beautiful PNAS study
breathing, cyclic hyperventilation, used increase epinephrin, increase
norepinephrine, augment catecholamine system. So, think bridges
studies really relevant. one case, talking potentially
taking over-the-counter compound increase dopamine accelerate healing.
another case, talking using breathing. also use cold water
exposure increase dopamine. talked several episodes ago,
shown immersing oneself cold water neck so. cold? Well,
depends can tolerate, uncomfortably cold, not cold
become hypothermic, challenging get in, can stay three
10 minutes so, shown lead significant, doubling
baseline dopamine levels epinephrin levels go several hours. may
basis people will cold showers ice baths get sauna.
So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment
neurotransmitters. Today, talking neurotransmitters can
used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally
exposure cold water, instance, can done even just simply breathing
particular way, cyclic hyperventilation followed retention. catacholamines,


noradrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine bridge activation immune
system nervous system. way nervous system calls
immune system, "Aha, problem. need counter this." can
think them, meaning dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, able
deploy larger amounts immune cells,

01:42:05 You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis

types immune cells talked beginning episode. Okay,
thus far, discussing one can prevent getting sick one starts
feel ill, one might able shorten course infection ramping
activity immune system. already experiencing
symptoms? runny nose, stuffed nose, congestion, headache, et cetera. Well,
many ways address symptom level. probably aware
counter medications, many focus epinephrin system. Things
Sudafed variety prevent reduce congestion way
cause release epinephrin, effects dilating bronchioles
dilating nasal passages forth. not going speak whether not
good bad choices. couple effects not great
course treating underlying cause, first can cause dehydration.
make sure hydrating well, fluids electrolytes,
also can interfere sleep talked episodes sleep,
one hallmarks deep sleep particular REM sleep epinephrin,
adrenaline levels low. allows intense, often
emotionally-laden dreams REM sleep not act out. low adrenaline,
epinephrin REM sleep basically signature, neurochemical signature
REM sleep state, vital emotional physical repair forth. So,
fact can inhibit sleep, fact can cause dehydration, fact can
make people feel kind lightheaded jittery makes not terrific choices
number people. interesting alternative choice. say alternative,
mean alternative. choice referring spirulina, actually
form algae. Years ago, think first heard spirulina, sounded much
kind 1970s, 80s health food store variety. seemed really kind mystical
wacky, actually now really nice studies data, also


understanding mechanism spirulina can potent effects reducing
called rhinitis, fancy word congestion nose
inflammation nose. Basically, anytime hear word includes "itis," least
medical health context, generally means inflammation tissue.
rhinitis just inflammation nasal passages, one
uncomfortable symptoms kind infection. two studies like
highlight just quickly. One effects spirulina allergic rhinitis.
clinical comparison efficacy spirulina platensis, technical name,
cetirizine treatment allergic rhinitis. looked humans, not
mouse study, study humans. sexes, males females. one
case, looking 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects. other, 65 subjects, decent
number subjects, randomized trial, double blind. cases saw significant decreases
nasal obstruction, improved ability smell, improved sleep, daily working
inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.

vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked

discovered studies groups discovered
stimulation dopamine pathway, either simply thinking future, ideally
positive future, thinking positive future leads activation so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway reduce size tumors, accelerate
wound healing, greatly accelerate passage state illness state
health wellbeing. many, many studies now starting wick related
this. also idea augmenting dopamine system can increase
rate healing. so, individuals opt, instance, take
things increase dopamine. Now, obviously drugs abuse not good idea


context, even though increase dopamine, lead big crashes,
addictive properties, et cetera. talked podcast things like L-
tyrosine, taking anywhere 500 750 milligrams can increase dopamine
tyrosine dopamine precursor, course. Things like Mucuna pruriens, L-

crash certain individuals. people tolerate little bit better. Again,
talk doctor, figure right you. bipolar

fact related sense future seems liberate entire systems
within body make inflammatory cytokines go down, anti-inflammatory
cytokines go up. Exactly demonstrated beautiful PNAS study
breathing, cyclic hyperventilation, used increase epinephrin, increase
norepinephrine, augment catecholamine system. So, think bridges
studies really relevant. one case, talking potentially
taking over-the-counter compound increase dopamine accelerate healing.
another case, talking using breathing. also use cold water
exposure increase dopamine. talked several episodes ago,
shown immersing oneself cold water neck so. cold? Well,
depends can tolerate, uncomfortably cold, not cold
become hypothermic, challenging get in, can stay three
10 minutes so, shown lead significant, doubling
baseline dopamine levels epinephrin levels go several hours. may
basis people will cold showers ice baths get sauna.
So, called cold-heat contrast therapy, way augment
neurotransmitters. Today, talking neurotransmitters can
used enhance function immune system. just keep mind
anytime talking increasing neurotransmitter levels, can done
pharmacologically supplementation, can done behaviorally
exposure cold water, instance, can done even just simply breathing
particular way, cyclic hyperventilation followed retention. catacholamines,


noradrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine bridge activation immune

01:42:05 You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis

types immune cells talked beginning episode. Okay,
thus far, discussing one can prevent getting sick one starts
feel ill, one might able shorten course infection ramping

many ways address symptom level. probably aware

adrenaline levels low. allows intense, often
emotionally-laden dreams REM sleep not act out. low adrenaline,
epinephrin REM sleep basically signature, neurochemical signature
REM sleep state, vital emotional physical repair forth. So,
fact can inhibit sleep, fact can cause dehydration, fact can
make people feel kind lightheaded jittery makes not terrific choices
number people. interesting alternative choice. say alternative,
mean alternative. choice referring spirulina, actually
form algae. Years ago, think first heard spirulina, sounded much
kind 1970s, 80s health food store variety. seemed really kind mystical
wacky, actually now really nice studies data, also


understanding mechanism spirulina can potent effects reducing
called rhinitis, fancy word congestion nose
inflammation nose. Basically, anytime hear word includes "itis," least
medical health context, generally means inflammation tissue.
rhinitis just inflammation nasal passages, one
uncomfortable symptoms kind infection. two studies like
highlight just quickly. One effects spirulina allergic rhinitis.
clinical comparison efficacy spirulina platensis, technical name,
cetirizine treatment allergic rhinitis. looked humans, not
mouse study, study humans. sexes, males females. one
case, looking 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects. other, 65 subjects, decent
number subjects, randomized trial, double blind. cases saw significant decreases
nasal obstruction, improved ability smell, improved sleep, daily working
inflammatory cytokines reduced well, reduction nasal itching, stuff
like experience, can imagine, taking two grams, two grams, not
milligrams, two grams spirulina. Sometimes taken short
effect kicked in. So, pretty impressive, say, doesn't really
speak mechanism,

01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells

exploring underlying mechanisms spirulina's effects reducing rhinitis,
interesting find spirulina actually can inhibit formation and/or activity so-
called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. haven't talked lot mast
cells, interesting cell type immune response. Essentially
are, little packets histamine. sort injury irritant
rather skin, mosquito bite, instance, poison oak poison ivy,
something causes itch something causes inflammation internally, doesn't
just skin, mast little bubbles contain histamine
go site [hissing], release histaminergic contents cause swelling
inflammation whatever cells affected locally. might think, well,
want mechanism body cause swelling inflammation?
Ah, well cells turn send cytokine signals recruit cell types
talking way back beginning episode, cells


characteristics innate immune system come in, macrophages
types cells will come gobble foreign invaders will help
sequester move away, say poison bite whatever irritant. Again,
doesn't just skin surface. describing example skin,
instance, ever hives kind, almost certainly involved mast cells.
So, take anti-histamine order deal seasonal allergies,
instance, taking compound reducing histamines mast cells.
spirulina also used quite effectively way treat seasonal allergies
symptomatology. Equally par major prescription
counter drugs that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry side
effects people genetic mutation leading something called PKU.
people know are. sensitive phenylalanine. people
cannot drink sort NutraSweet diet soda reasons understand. can
quite dangerous. rare genetic disorder, nonetheless, spirulina can
issue people. people, side effect profile pretty minimal. just
clear, don't relationship spirulina company anything. just find
interesting compounds sound rather, forgive phrase,
rather new-agey come algae, plant. look
underlying mechanism, makes perfect sense. often like point
so-called alternative therapies, alternative
people haven't heard them, always nice map specific logical
mechanism framework compound work, opposed just
anecdote of, "Oh, hear spirulina great allergies." Well, now know why,
inhibits mast cells

01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism Reduces Inflammation; Fascia,
Rolfing

histaminergic mast cells particular. Earlier, mentioned new exciting
study published full article "Nature." Full article means major finding.
journal, "Nature," letters, important findings. still
high stringency getting letter "Nature" published. full articles, generally
one two per issue weekly edition "Nature." just last week,
exciting article published Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical


School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,
region hind brain back brain kind near neck
medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

School. Qiufu known number years. group done phenomenal work
mechanisms itch pain discovering receptors
pathways itch pain. recently exploring mechanistic
basis acupuncture. title article is, "A neuroanatomical basis
electroacupuncture drive vagal adrenal axis." mouthful, now
probably familiar mean say vagal adrenal axis;
vagal meaning vagus, adrenal adrenal glands. perhaps
not surprised, although excited, nonetheless, Qiufu's lab looked
stimulation body so-called electroacupuncture. So, needles
small bit electrical current, low level electrical current, passed needle
therefore body. located sites body can increase inflammation
way releasing inflammatory cytokines. areas included abdomen,
found areas body lower limbs, hind limbs case,
can stimulate vagal adrenal reflex can lead reduced inflammation.
really interesting figured activation nerve endings
resided fascia. mentioned earlier fascia is, just remind you, fascia
really thick sheath tissue surrounds muscle. ever heard Rolfing,
Rolfing form intense massage. never done, heard
this. involves among things, actually separating muscle away fascia
somewhat. very, deep tissue massage. Actually good friend mine
done told probably challenging physical experience
ever going Rolfing procedure. Maybe
Rolfed, say, can report experience, whether not
pleasant unpleasant, felt benefits not. case, study isn't
Rolfing per se, fascia. discovered specific
population neurons. neurons name, often science. Name
isn't important, want look up, PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2
neurons. send connection deep limb fascial tissue, okay?
send another connection, connections referring axons, neurons
axons. wire one direction goes deep fascial tissue lower
limb, near calf thigh. send another wire spinal cord,
region hind brain back brain kind near neck
medulla oblongata, neuron also name called DMZ, doesn't matter.
neuron connects adrenal gland release good old friends,


catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrin, dopamine. release causes reduction inflammation, even
response injection something called lipopolysaccharide, can actually
induce fever. So, saying? saying activation deep
fascial tissue causes chain neural reactions leads eventually release
norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine. again, lowers
inflammation, much like breathing study

01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices

talked earlier pattern cyclical hyperventilation retention,
leading reductions inflammation. can't tell happy makes me.
nothing work, reason makes happy
particular fondness practices existed many centuries even
thousands years, acupuncture, respiration work, start converge
hardcore mechanistic science. reason excites not

ancient practices, not all. certainly isn't case just want name
things rename things modern science. exciting can
discover mechanism explains certain practices work. First all, validates
legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start cover them, whereas
maybe previously not, don't know current status insurance
coverage acupuncture. guessing places it, maybe others
don't. personally not somebody receives acupuncture. past,
not particular fan it, think number people

something cultivated practice years. mentioned earlier, use
push back incoming infections forth. now doesn't sound like

published mechanism explain it. exciting thing
practices traditionally shrouded complicated language
unique domain practitioners relied phrases like meridians
chakras, think perfectly valid language, doesn't inform mechanism.
separate community, community come from, community scientists,


used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.
basically no one can communicate one another language shrouding.
now starting see convergence common mechanism.
understanding, going really terrific new protocols start

forth, can now start daydream realistic way development
new protocols, effective protocols. Protocols perhaps one can home
without needles, perhaps protocols breathing can anywhere,
anytime, confident actually impacting IL-6 IL-8 pathways,
reducing increasing IL-10. no longer wandering around fog
hearing magical techniques without understanding work,
just seeing bunch science descriptive, not mechanistic pointing
