now, conversation Dr. Samer Hattar. Samer, thanks sitting
me. - pleasure. - Yeah, go way back. So, best known scientific circles
work light impacts mood, learning, feeding, hunger, sleep,
sorts topics. So, just kick ball onto field, speak, light
impact way feel? So, get morning, opportunity
interact light certain ways avoid light certain ways. opportunity
interact sunlight artificial light. Maybe just wade us
relationship light things like mood hunger, et cetera. - Sure.
So, mean, appreciate effect light vision. So, wake
beautiful area, beautiful ocean, light essential; sunrise, sunset, blue sky,
beautiful mountains. So, conscious perception light, light
completely different aspect independent conscious vision image forming
functions. regulates many important functions body. think
best well studied well known circadian clock. word circadian
comes word circa, approximate diem day. So,
approximate day. approximate day? put
human normal circadian clock constant conditions no
information feeding time, sleep time, time outside, still
daily rhythm, not exactly 24 hours. will shift solar day
not exactly 24 hours, hence name circadian. - So, just ask
quick question that. say 24 hour rhythm,
rhythm show tissues body? - Great question. So, shows
every level know studied; shows level cell. shows
level tissue, shows behavior. obvious


sleep-wake cycle. sleep awake sleep 24 hour rhythms.
measure sleep-wake cycle humans maintaining constant
conditions, will see period length sleep rhythm average
24 hours. humans 24.2 hours. drifting .2 hours every day
solar day don't get sunlight. sunlight adjusts approximate day
exact day, now behavior adjusted light-dark environment solar
day. - Okay, understand correctly, go cave- - Yeah. -
constant light. - Yeah. - didn't close eyes- - Yeah. - constant light,
still sleep one coherent about. - Yes. - still awake
less one coherent about, maybe nap. - Yes. - total duration day,
speak, little bit longer 24 hours? - Perfect. - condition like
people sun goes sun goes down,
understanding sunrise sunset, then- - don't understanding,
don't conscious understanding. detection. - Right. - So,
circadian photoentrainment word use, entraining circadian clock
photic environment completely subconscious. not aware it. not like vision
image forming, actually know looking at. So,
hypothalamic. part brain not consciously driven. So, actually not
know happens doesn't happen. get
tell light affects mood sometimes people don't know deal
light improve mood, example. - Okay, subconscious vision. -
Yes. - Okay. tell us light impacts mood, curious,
relevance adjusting clock little bit longer 24 hours 24 hours?
mean, seems like small difference, 24 hours 40 minutes 24 hours. Like
relevance? mean, care short difference? - So,
math. shift .2 hours day, five days shifting one hour.
literally one hour off social behavior five days. 10 days, two hours off.
organism living wild, shifting right phase
cycle, either miss food become food. really essential
survival. think one strongest aspect survival animals
anticipation adjustment solar cycle. - humans well.
say animals, assuming applies us? - Absolutely, yeah. - see. even though
just short bit longer 24, accumulates days, find
much phase rest species essentially. - Yeah,


say .2 hours. So, five days one hour. 25 days five six hours.
New York feeling traveled New York
London. So, jet lag New York, even though didn't jet lag
travel. important adjustment. time, maybe
talk important seasonality, also allows animals
anticipate change season. high north south,
weather changes occur harshly, ready
them. happens us well. - right, well, will definitely get
seasonality. Okay, got subconscious vision aligns us turn
earth. work? machinery allows happen?
machinery work? - Yeah, so, knew mammals, including us,
mammals, humans, eyes required function. So, humans
born without eyes, optic nerves damaged, humans not able adjust
solar cycle. know eyes required. since thought knew
eyes lot 2000, thought that- - say year 2000? -
year 2000, yes. - Mm hm, yep. - thought photoreceptors
retina allow see. So, human retinas, two types
photoreceptors; called rods cones shapes. rods
cones simply take photon energy, light made of, change
way electrical signal allow us build image environment
cortices. - Subconsciously? - Consciously situation cause vision, right?
image forming vision, visual cortex, associative cortices, allow
build conscious perception environment. However, people found, including
work David Berson Ignacio Provencio, subset
ganglion cells. ganglion cells cells leave retina, axon leave
retina project brain. thought relay rod cone
information light environment brain. found small subset
ganglion cells photoreceptors completely missed
retina. photoreceptors relay light environment subconsciously
areas brain house circadian clock circadian
pacemaker, adjusts clocks bodies central brain clock
allows entrain 24 hour light-dark cycle.

00:14:30 Neurons Eyes Set Body Clocks: Similar Frog Skin



- Incredible. So, recall 'cause graduate student time, year 2000,
landmark discovery made you, Ignacio Provencio, David Berson,
others, cells exists can communicate day night information
brain. - Yeah. - small subset cells. Since then, heard, maybe
can confirm refute system connects eyes rest brain
actually ancient form vision. probably form vision
early version human beings pattern vision,
see colors shapes motion that. cells
perform role actually similar insect eyes. think heard David Berson say
actually little bit fly eye eye. talking about? -
Yeah. So, really interesting actually, ipRCGs discovered
contribute little bit image formation. now, work Tiffany Schmidt
specifically proven contribute image forming functions.
contribute limited aspect image formation. So, fits hypothesis
ancient photoreceptors. thing adds hypothesis
expressed cells don't modification make look like
photoreceptors. So, photoreceptors told important vision,
image formation, specialized structures allow pack
structures photopigments; photo-detecting proteins,
detect high sensitivity photons pass them. new photoreceptors
don't specialized structures. just really need lot light time,
thought need lot light activated. think
ancient. think adjust ancient functions important
regulating body circadian clock solar environment, solar day light-
dark cycle. - So, mentioned ipRCGs, intrinsically photosensitive. cells
connect eye brain behave like photoreceptors. - Right. - Essentially.
mentioned melanopsin, actual pigment converts light
electrical signal- - Yeah. - less. understanding
melanopsin identified first frog melanophores. - Yes. - mean
like little pieces frog skin eyes? - So, honestly, David Berson say
fly eye sounds better. accurate think
frog skin eye. not catchy, really, name melanopsin
melanocyte opsin, melanopsin found frog melanocytes.


know frogs can change color depending light melanopsin drives
response. Ignacio Provencio first discovered opsins frogs, luckily
smart enough see expressed frog eye. expressed
frog eye appears retinal ganglion cells, told you, one
connects eye brain. insight go see
expressed monkey eye. found also expressed
appears retinal ganglion cells, really opened field wide open.
David Berson seminal experiment went brain
central oscillator, oscillator drives circadian rhythm brain called
suprachiasmatic nucleus, known many years receive retinal input.
labeled cells project there. found even destroy
rods cones, get light responses cells. imagine
nearly fainted saw cells can respond independent, completely
absence rod cone input. - Yeah, never forget reading papers 2000,
2001. meeting DC Ignacio, Iggy, call Iggy, showed
image basically frog melanophores human eye. - Yes. - [Andrew]
everyone like, "oh goodness, thing." - Yeah. - want get
light

00:18:55 Blind People See

actually can control circadian rhythms. moment. - Absolutely. - think worth
mentioning now people pattern vision blind, people cannot see
no conscious vision, eyes, many still cells;
melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive cells, can essentially match entrain,
say, onto light-dark cycle. - fact, possibly no problems circadian
photoentrainment, normal sleep-wake cycle. - totally blind? -
totally image blind. really interesting that, story
heard Chuck Czeisler, give credit, people
image blind, usually get dry eyes give lot pain. doctors used
think, oh, since image blind getting dry eye, don't just
remove eyes? not using anymore. minute remove
eyes, start cyclical sleep problems indicating now not
entraining light-dark cycle cyclical jet lags clock shifts


light-dark cycle. - really interesting. hear number blind
people various aspects job, lot issues sleep. think,
part don't realize

00:20:15 When, & Long View Light Optimal Sleep & Wakefulness

need see light particular times day night order match schedule. -
Absolutely. - Well, think perfect segue us talk light viewing
light can impact sleep-wake rhythms. move
ways light can impact forms bodily function. - Yeah, love way
set one interesting difficult aspect trying educate
people light effect subconscious vision subconscious.
aware think intensity see room, talk people
know take photographs stuff like that, know intensities
varies greatly. system, see way bright
conditions dim conditions, not good estimating intensity
consciously. try tell people intensity, really struggle
think know intensity, really don't. - mean light intensity? - Light
intensity. - Yeah. - cones incredible ability adapt
different light conditions. can see different conditions. Otherwise it'd
disaster. don't change setting camera go inside room
outside, becomes completely white, don't see anything. cones
don't adapt environment, not going able see room
beach, right? problem ipRCGs, cells talked about,
measure intensity pretty well. really know intensity is. good
linear measurement intensity. don't adapt well. don't adapt actually
much, honest. tells subconsciously system used
measuring light intensity natural environment, now
natural environment, don't industrialized lighting, system
functioning well. now change environments, really
mess ourselves. teach people understand intensity.
something explain people. think love myself.
called lowest amount light required allow see comfortably.
fun experiment. - Okay, explain goes.


maybe break day three four parts. say assuming
people wake morning- - Mm hm. - opposed night shift workers, et
cetera, talk later. - Right. - wake morning,
divide day quarters. proper way interact light first part
day? - So, honestly think easiest thing waking up, get much light
can. - eyes? - Yeah, really nice. system prime. entrained,
prime get light, sun out. animals wild, actually seem
track sun. sun huge influence life earth. actually life earth
sun. So, easy. morning wake up, need light. Just
get light. - Okay, behavioral practice recommend? say
somebody condition lot cloud cover. - Yeah. - important
get outside? - So, tell you, cloudiest day going much brighter
room. ask photographer. cloudy day, unless really dark,
dark clouds, usually cloudy days much light outside inside room,
even good lighting inside room. think outside usually
even cloudy, going get enough intensity help adjust
cycle day-night cycle. - So, long you... general rules thumb,
long recommend people go outside? - So, daily, possibly
need few. daily, remember thing going happen
daily matter. So, say 15 minutes. - So, clock tracking regular basis? -
Absolutely. photon counting, tracking. say 15 minutes. don't
daily, may want increase it. talk travel,
do, yeah, 15 minutes fine. more, doesn't hurt. -
window, understanding window, dramatically decreases
amount light energy coming in. - depends thick windows
dark are. So, also nice go outside feel seasons. - Sunglasses
off? - don't use sunglasses. - Yeah, Jordanian photopigment. - Yeah,
yeah, right. - know, so, yeah. Whereas eyes sensitive, right? -
No, personally, shade not incredibly bright, try to, especially
morning, also early person. differentiate early- -
time wake up? - wake 4:30 morning. - sun isn't yet.
- not yet, it's- - So, do? turn artificial lights? - usually
don't turn artificial light know sun going come eventually,
don't like change timing do. - Wait,


4:30 a.m. 7:00 a.m.? - mean, look computer, phone. - Oh,
see. - possibly get enough light, reality, mean long let body
get morning sunlight, think really, no evidence this,
me, look animals, plants, morning sunlight seems
important. don't experiments show it, gut feeling
huge impact humans. - Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab Stanford Sleep Lab
shown early morning light flashes can adjust total amount sleep- -
Absolutely. - one will get. makes easier get sleep. - Absolutely,
absolutely. Ken Wright also beautiful camping experiments showed
that- - Maybe describe 'cause beautiful experiments. - Oh,
yeah, beautiful experiments. took college students late
onset sleep late waking time, said, go camping just don't
use artificial light go sleep late early want,
wake late early. found huge shift sleep pattern just
exposing light-dark cycle. mean, so- - lasted. - lasted,
yeah. - Even came back. - Exactly. - two days camping reset
circadian clock? - Seven days, lasted. Yeah, pretty amazing. Yeah, really
incredible. - Okay, get bright light sort early day, ideally sunlight, even
cloudy day, going be- - Absolutely. - Brighter indoor light. -
easy. - Okay, then- - thing like mention people,
think dim outside, say cloudy, stay longer. remember intensity
one component. Duration also important remember circadian
system not like image system. image system change every
second looking different objects. change perception.
circadian system trying figure day-night cycle?
give information, better are. So, bright,
don't need lot clearly going make fire like crazy. not bright,
stay longer, stay one hour. know, coffee outside something like
that. just going help. - think said something extremely important,
circadian system trying figure time. - Exactly. - Not
space. - Sorry, said, time. - Yeah. - mean are. -
Oh no, no, wasn't correcting you. just meant think fundamentally
incredible thing system. - Absolutely. - clock, 24 hour
clock brain, needs synchronized outside. go little


deeper circadian setting behavior come general rules
thumb? So, say bright day. - Mm hm, mm hm. - Extremely bright. No
clouds, sun's out. said 10 minutes, 15 minutes. - tell
sensitive, don't even go sun. shade. going
many photons shade. going perfect. don't even
see sun. don't sun. know, great vitamin D,
different story. skin protect skin. not
area expertise, effect circadian system, long
outside shade sunny day, 10 15 minutes ample amount. -
Okay say kind overcast. know, not particularly bright
solid cloud cover, obviously sun out, not bright. long
think take set clock? - 10 15 sufficient. Stay half
hour. Stay 45 minutes. darker out, stay longer. - Okay
reason, one finds far north, very, dense cloud cover.
long point somebody consider using artificial light source mimic
sunlight? - Yeah, honestly, don't lot information still,
going discuss maybe detail, put
humans artificial conditions, circadian system sensitive light,
reality, real environment, light also affecting aspects independent
setting circadian pacemaker. - Okay. - call direct
effect light mood, example. So, hard figure intensity
need use. haven't done enough experiments 'cause system
discovered just recently. say use bright light morning,
mean, hard give numbers.

00:30:20 Sunlight Simulators, Afternoon Light Viewing, Naps

can get complicated. yeah, mean, honestly, far north
winter make sure don't, use light boxes. suggest
personally, it. - use, actually not designed circadian setting,
930 lux light pad bought bought it, affordable compared
dawn simulating lights. - Yeah, don't need them. - quite expensive,
frankly. - Yeah. - put there. so, just basically, wake morning,
use sun comes out, make sure sun out, go


outside. keep thing day. don't know good bad. good
bad? - I, honestly, don't think exposed bright light day going ever
bad really outside day... Unless, know, worst
going happen temperature high, body's going say don't dehydrate
go sleep. tell actually sometimes hot,
get exposed bright light, sleepier feel afternoon, counter-
intuitive. - Mm hm. protect us, think, dehydration? - think
think human evolution near equator noon certain
time afternoon, hard maintain physiological
homeostatic function, active high temperature time. think napping
way, think major function still... Napping way
somehow take away dangerous zone. maybe people
north say, winter can't wake morning 'cause don't
long light. So, sleep night. summer say, feel like can't
go sleep. put dark curtains. So, think, venturing much
north been... Came problem evolution used certain light
environment completely changed human. animals, think
lived longer, come interesting adaptation actually
measuring even small changes light intensities still occur. so, even
near poles, even though always light, change light
intensity across day-night cycle. So, system, linear, remember told
ipRCGs incredibly linear, can still measure, oh, lower light higher
light organism ability that. - see, yeah, interesting. spent
much time learning fortunately cells, yet never really
appreciated now one hand tracking amount light
understand time relative 24 hour cycle, also keep
mentioning linear measurement intensity; really trying figure
time measuring intensity light. course sun
intense source light available us. So, okay, think nailed
first part day. - Exactly. - Basically get 10 30 minutes depending
bright is, try often possible give system regular source- -
Daily best. system really about, see even effect
depression, multiple days is. don't worry missed one
day,



00:33:48 Jetlagged Home? Chronotypes & Early Risers Succeed

stay longer want. hurry want stuff,
great recommendation. - Mm hm, might want compensate extra
time missed day two. - Absolutely. - heard say before,
entirely possible get severely jet lagged without traveling. - Absolutely. - Simply
staying in, phone much, not getting sunlight. - Absolutely.
saw pandemic. lot people mentioned sleep-wake cycles
suffered lot. not going staying home
don't big windows waking late, waking late, using
bright light late night, body going shift. now, day going
start instead like really sun comes up, say six o'clock
morning, day going start 11 o'clock morning.
body's going think beginning day. So, not going able
sleep 10 o'clock night, now really body, completely
different timing. see happen pandemic high
scale. People get delayed sleep-wake cycle lot. - idea
chronotypes, intrinsically best rhythm either morning
person. - Absolutely. - called early person, night owl,
kind standard bed around 10:30, around 7:00 type thing. think
now good data, correct wrong, National Institutes Mental Health
elsewhere showing deviate intrinsic rhythm, mental
health issues physical health issues start crop up. - So, great data this,
couple things complicate this. first people usually
late, tell society doesn't accommodate. - late,
mean? People wake late go sleep late? - Go sleep late wake
late. overwhelmingly higher level depression failures. mean,
clearly, mean, reason people say sleep early, wake early, better
human notice people go sleep early wake early,
better life. notice that. - just perform better? - perform,
question is, intrinsic system society society start things
usually early late? hard question ask- - discriminate late risers.
- way, discriminate, right? explanation Ken Wright's experiment.


late riser, truly chronotypically late, shift easily
put the... really chronotypically late, phase
relation light-dark environment circadian clock,
camping experiment not caused much changes not light
going affect certain way, relationship body
decided late sleeper, late waking. So, honestly, still unable figure
much late waking controlled light environment much
intrinsic. sure differences, big see
environment? people go off sleep 7:00 p.m. wake
1:00 a.m.. clearly advanced phase- - people go sleep 7:00 p.m.
wake 1:00 a.m.? - Yeah. - feel good that? - not sure feel
good, lot time talk people, say high achievers,
suffer go 7:00 p.m., wake advanced phase sleep syndrome.
call syndrome, people not able sleep till 5:00
a.m., not able wake till 3:00 p.m., right? not sure
circadian system variable human population. mean, clearly
maybe genetic factors make small percentage like everything bell
shape. think time, light environment may play role. once,
talked about, long-term effect light. get rhythm,
don't mean pun, reality, get rhythm, hard break
rhythm start sleeping late waking late, not getting
morning sunlight. - Right. - so, just going late. like
waking early, getting morning sunlight. getting Zeitzer said...
said last name wrong. one Stanford the- - Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah. -
Zeitzer, yeah. - [Andrew] actually worked for- - Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer. So, Zeitzer
Czeisler. - Yeah, confusing.

00:38:33 Decide Best Sleep-Wake Schedule; Minimal Light Test

- Yeah, lot zz's i's names. - Yeah. - phenomenal
scientists. - Yeah. - seems case way really know
meant early bird call it, early person late person,
somewhere get morning sunlight, figure whether not
makes feel better. - understand, educated measure


intensity. "How measure" put quotation 'cause either get measuring device,
cannot depend eye measure intensity. - Okay, that?
'Cause keep coming back this. So, tells important. -
important. - So, obviously, apps, free apps like Light Meter, can
walk around hold button see many lux environment. -
complicated point specific regions. - Right. So,
people start develop intuitive sense measurement intensity? -
Yeah, think one point posted Instagram, keep nighttime home.
found night vision strong. found I, especially
winter, need candle lights. literally use tea lights, put like 15 20
them- - romantic. - nice. see clearly doesn't affect
circadian system. - cats- - wife. - wife course. - just
great, right? don't expect people night vision me. So, mean,
tell people, experiment. put three four lights room, switch two,
sit 15 minutes. - Switch two off? - Switch two off. say using five. see,
15 minutes, will not recognize switched two off. gut feeling
people need least 10 times less light use night see.
problem people use time didn't see morning sunlight.
actually hungry light without knowledge. come switch
lights on, wrong time. woke late. - Okay, now understand.
So, morning light viewing goes way beyond- - Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting
clock. also way determine little light need later day. - Exactly. -
going talk moment, little light get later day
strong determinant things like will wake up, whether not
wake feeling refreshed, et cetera. move- - why, - Yeah? - going
break show, Andrew, going tell you, think something else
people need think about, tripartite model. model
incorporate three components talk details allows us humans
animals incorporate circadian clock, relation light, homeostatic
drive, direct effect environment, includes stress, light, kinds
stuff. incorporated together. think, think right now,
think one alone, will always miss something. think
whole, things really become clear. actually quite amazing. - Okay, well, will
definitely want hear tripartite theory go detail


homeostatic mechanisms. want make sure people thinking now,
sure light impacts them. morning light viewing behavior, like
think tacked clearly. - Absolutely. - thank
much information tried relay information. course,
primary source things circadian, well Jamie others,

00:42:16 Viewing Light Middle Day: Mood & “Light Hunger”

course, Matt Walker. think made very, clear. Now, say
gotten morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe bright artificial light,
throughout day said get lot light. So, working desk. Maybe go
day times, working computer, things.
anything light viewing middle day people keep mind?
can just sort freestyle depending doing? people not
dark room throughout day- - Yeah, gut feeling, got morning
sunlight, walk car slowly walk work, didn't wear sunglasses
lights still dim morning, freestyle it. even
don't get lot light, way just... day, don't just worry
getting lot bright light, personally, like that. go lunch
lunch outside well. reminds body even brighter now.
evidence literally help circadian clock giving lights
dawn dusk. again, think tripartite model, may important
circadian clock, important mood? think need,
homeostatic drive. need think it. So, clock,
entraining clock, literally can entrain dawn sunlight. actually
don't need dawn dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah appreciate
distinguishing circadian effects effects lights. - Yes. -
precise, appreciated. hear tripartite model,
will cover, sake discussion, treat light viewing behavior
benefits drawbacks viewing light biological purposes, not just
circadian settings? So, morning, clearly going set clock. then,
day, understand correctly, idea get much bright light can,
feeding, sounds like sort light hunger. - Exactly. - see. - love
way put it. think weird light hunger considering not


photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

now, conversation Dr. Samer Hattar. Samer, thanks sitting
me. - pleasure. - Yeah, go way back. So, best known scientific circles
work light impacts mood, learning, feeding, hunger, sleep,
sorts topics. So, just kick ball onto field, speak, light
impact way feel? So, get morning, opportunity
interact light certain ways avoid light certain ways. opportunity
interact sunlight artificial light. Maybe just wade us
relationship light things like mood hunger, et cetera. - Sure.
So, mean, appreciate effect light vision. So, wake
beautiful area, beautiful ocean, light essential; sunrise, sunset, blue sky,
beautiful mountains. So, conscious perception light, light
completely different aspect independent conscious vision image forming
functions. regulates many important functions body. think
best well studied well known circadian clock. word circadian
comes word circa, approximate diem day. So,
approximate day. approximate day? put
human normal circadian clock constant conditions no
information feeding time, sleep time, time outside, still
daily rhythm, not exactly 24 hours. will shift solar day
not exactly 24 hours, hence name circadian. - So, just ask
quick question that. say 24 hour rhythm,
rhythm show tissues body? - Great question. So, shows
every level know studied; shows level cell. shows
level tissue, shows behavior. obvious


sleep-wake cycle. sleep awake sleep 24 hour rhythms.
measure sleep-wake cycle humans maintaining constant
conditions, will see period length sleep rhythm average
24 hours. humans 24.2 hours. drifting .2 hours every day
solar day don't get sunlight. sunlight adjusts approximate day
exact day, now behavior adjusted light-dark environment solar
day. - Okay, understand correctly, go cave- - Yeah. -
constant light. - Yeah. - didn't close eyes- - Yeah. - constant light,
still sleep one coherent about. - Yes. - still awake
less one coherent about, maybe nap. - Yes. - total duration day,
speak, little bit longer 24 hours? - Perfect. - condition like
people sun goes sun goes down,
understanding sunrise sunset, then- - don't understanding,
don't conscious understanding. detection. - Right. - So,
circadian photoentrainment word use, entraining circadian clock
photic environment completely subconscious. not aware it. not like vision
image forming, actually know looking at. So,
hypothalamic. part brain not consciously driven. So, actually not
know happens doesn't happen. get
tell light affects mood sometimes people don't know deal
light improve mood, example. - Okay, subconscious vision. -
Yes. - Okay. tell us light impacts mood, curious,
relevance adjusting clock little bit longer 24 hours 24 hours?
mean, seems like small difference, 24 hours 40 minutes 24 hours. Like
relevance? mean, care short difference? - So,
math. shift .2 hours day, five days shifting one hour.
literally one hour off social behavior five days. 10 days, two hours off.
organism living wild, shifting right phase
cycle, either miss food become food. really essential
survival. think one strongest aspect survival animals
anticipation adjustment solar cycle. - humans well.
say animals, assuming applies us? - Absolutely, yeah. - see. even though
just short bit longer 24, accumulates days, find
much phase rest species essentially. - Yeah,


say .2 hours. So, five days one hour. 25 days five six hours.
New York feeling traveled New York
London. So, jet lag New York, even though didn't jet lag
travel. important adjustment. time, maybe
talk important seasonality, also allows animals
anticipate change season. high north south,
weather changes occur harshly, ready
them. happens us well. - right, well, will definitely get
seasonality. Okay, got subconscious vision aligns us turn
earth. work? machinery allows happen?
machinery work? - Yeah, so, knew mammals, including us,
mammals, humans, eyes required function. So, humans
born without eyes, optic nerves damaged, humans not able adjust
solar cycle. know eyes required. since thought knew
eyes lot 2000, thought that- - say year 2000? -
year 2000, yes. - Mm hm, yep. - thought photoreceptors
retina allow see. So, human retinas, two types
photoreceptors; called rods cones shapes. rods
cones simply take photon energy, light made of, change
way electrical signal allow us build image environment
cortices. - Subconsciously? - Consciously situation cause vision, right?
image forming vision, visual cortex, associative cortices, allow
build conscious perception environment. However, people found, including
work David Berson Ignacio Provencio, subset
ganglion cells. ganglion cells cells leave retina, axon leave
retina project brain. thought relay rod cone
information light environment brain. found small subset
ganglion cells photoreceptors completely missed
retina. photoreceptors relay light environment subconsciously
areas brain house circadian clock circadian
pacemaker, adjusts clocks bodies central brain clock
allows entrain 24 hour light-dark cycle.

00:14:30 Neurons Eyes Set Body Clocks: Similar Frog Skin



- Incredible. So, recall 'cause graduate student time, year 2000,
landmark discovery made you, Ignacio Provencio, David Berson,
others, cells exists can communicate day night information
brain. - Yeah. - small subset cells. Since then, heard, maybe
can confirm refute system connects eyes rest brain
actually ancient form vision. probably form vision
early version human beings pattern vision,
see colors shapes motion that. cells
perform role actually similar insect eyes. think heard David Berson say
actually little bit fly eye eye. talking about? -
Yeah. So, really interesting actually, ipRCGs discovered
contribute little bit image formation. now, work Tiffany Schmidt
specifically proven contribute image forming functions.
contribute limited aspect image formation. So, fits hypothesis
ancient photoreceptors. thing adds hypothesis
expressed cells don't modification make look like
photoreceptors. So, photoreceptors told important vision,
image formation, specialized structures allow pack
structures photopigments; photo-detecting proteins,
detect high sensitivity photons pass them. new photoreceptors
don't specialized structures. just really need lot light time,
thought need lot light activated. think
ancient. think adjust ancient functions important
regulating body circadian clock solar environment, solar day light-
dark cycle. - So, mentioned ipRCGs, intrinsically photosensitive. cells
connect eye brain behave like photoreceptors. - Right. - Essentially.
mentioned melanopsin, actual pigment converts light
electrical signal- - Yeah. - less. understanding
melanopsin identified first frog melanophores. - Yes. - mean
like little pieces frog skin eyes? - So, honestly, David Berson say
fly eye sounds better. accurate think
frog skin eye. not catchy, really, name melanopsin
melanocyte opsin, melanopsin found frog melanocytes.


know frogs can change color depending light melanopsin drives
response. Ignacio Provencio first discovered opsins frogs, luckily
smart enough see expressed frog eye. expressed
frog eye appears retinal ganglion cells, told you, one
connects eye brain. insight go see
expressed monkey eye. found also expressed
appears retinal ganglion cells, really opened field wide open.
David Berson seminal experiment went brain
central oscillator, oscillator drives circadian rhythm brain called
suprachiasmatic nucleus, known many years receive retinal input.
labeled cells project there. found even destroy
rods cones, get light responses cells. imagine
nearly fainted saw cells can respond independent, completely
absence rod cone input. - Yeah, never forget reading papers 2000,
2001. meeting DC Ignacio, Iggy, call Iggy, showed
image basically frog melanophores human eye. - Yes. - [Andrew]
everyone like, "oh goodness, thing." - Yeah. - want get
light

00:18:55 Blind People See

actually can control circadian rhythms. moment. - Absolutely. - think worth
mentioning now people pattern vision blind, people cannot see
no conscious vision, eyes, many still cells;
melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive cells, can essentially match entrain,
say, onto light-dark cycle. - fact, possibly no problems circadian
photoentrainment, normal sleep-wake cycle. - totally blind? -
totally image blind. really interesting that, story
heard Chuck Czeisler, give credit, people
image blind, usually get dry eyes give lot pain. doctors used
think, oh, since image blind getting dry eye, don't just
remove eyes? not using anymore. minute remove
eyes, start cyclical sleep problems indicating now not
entraining light-dark cycle cyclical jet lags clock shifts


light-dark cycle. - really interesting. hear number blind
people various aspects job, lot issues sleep. think,
part don't realize

00:20:15 When, & Long View Light Optimal Sleep & Wakefulness

need see light particular times day night order match schedule. -
Absolutely. - Well, think perfect segue us talk light viewing
light can impact sleep-wake rhythms. move
ways light can impact forms bodily function. - Yeah, love way
set one interesting difficult aspect trying educate
people light effect subconscious vision subconscious.
aware think intensity see room, talk people
know take photographs stuff like that, know intensities
varies greatly. system, see way bright
conditions dim conditions, not good estimating intensity
consciously. try tell people intensity, really struggle
think know intensity, really don't. - mean light intensity? - Light
intensity. - Yeah. - cones incredible ability adapt
different light conditions. can see different conditions. Otherwise it'd
disaster. don't change setting camera go inside room
outside, becomes completely white, don't see anything. cones
don't adapt environment, not going able see room
beach, right? problem ipRCGs, cells talked about,
measure intensity pretty well. really know intensity is. good
linear measurement intensity. don't adapt well. don't adapt actually
much, honest. tells subconsciously system used
measuring light intensity natural environment, now
natural environment, don't industrialized lighting, system
functioning well. now change environments, really
mess ourselves. teach people understand intensity.
something explain people. think love myself.
called lowest amount light required allow see comfortably.
fun experiment. - Okay, explain goes.


maybe break day three four parts. say assuming
people wake morning- - Mm hm. - opposed night shift workers, et
cetera, talk later. - Right. - wake morning,
divide day quarters. proper way interact light first part
day? - So, honestly think easiest thing waking up, get much light
can. - eyes? - Yeah, really nice. system prime. entrained,
prime get light, sun out. animals wild, actually seem
track sun. sun huge influence life earth. actually life earth
sun. So, easy. morning wake up, need light. Just
get light. - Okay, behavioral practice recommend? say
somebody condition lot cloud cover. - Yeah. - important
get outside? - So, tell you, cloudiest day going much brighter
room. ask photographer. cloudy day, unless really dark,
dark clouds, usually cloudy days much light outside inside room,
even good lighting inside room. think outside usually
even cloudy, going get enough intensity help adjust
cycle day-night cycle. - So, long you... general rules thumb,
long recommend people go outside? - So, daily, possibly
need few. daily, remember thing going happen
daily matter. So, say 15 minutes. - So, clock tracking regular basis? -
Absolutely. photon counting, tracking. say 15 minutes. don't
daily, may want increase it. talk travel,
do, yeah, 15 minutes fine. more, doesn't hurt. -
window, understanding window, dramatically decreases
amount light energy coming in. - depends thick windows
dark are. So, also nice go outside feel seasons. - Sunglasses
off? - don't use sunglasses. - Yeah, Jordanian photopigment. - Yeah,
yeah, right. - know, so, yeah. Whereas eyes sensitive, right? -
No, personally, shade not incredibly bright, try to, especially
morning, also early person. differentiate early- -
time wake up? - wake 4:30 morning. - sun isn't yet.
- not yet, it's- - So, do? turn artificial lights? - usually
don't turn artificial light know sun going come eventually,
don't like change timing do. - Wait,


4:30 a.m. 7:00 a.m.? - mean, look computer, phone. - Oh,
see. - possibly get enough light, reality, mean long let body
get morning sunlight, think really, no evidence this,
me, look animals, plants, morning sunlight seems
important. don't experiments show it, gut feeling
huge impact humans. - Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab Stanford Sleep Lab
shown early morning light flashes can adjust total amount sleep- -
Absolutely. - one will get. makes easier get sleep. - Absolutely,
absolutely. Ken Wright also beautiful camping experiments showed
that- - Maybe describe 'cause beautiful experiments. - Oh,
yeah, beautiful experiments. took college students late
onset sleep late waking time, said, go camping just don't
use artificial light go sleep late early want,
wake late early. found huge shift sleep pattern just
exposing light-dark cycle. mean, so- - lasted. - lasted,
yeah. - Even came back. - Exactly. - two days camping reset
circadian clock? - Seven days, lasted. Yeah, pretty amazing. Yeah, really
incredible. - Okay, get bright light sort early day, ideally sunlight, even
cloudy day, going be- - Absolutely. - Brighter indoor light. -
easy. - Okay, then- - thing like mention people,
think dim outside, say cloudy, stay longer. remember intensity
one component. Duration also important remember circadian
system not like image system. image system change every
second looking different objects. change perception.
circadian system trying figure day-night cycle?
give information, better are. So, bright,
don't need lot clearly going make fire like crazy. not bright,
stay longer, stay one hour. know, coffee outside something like
that. just going help. - think said something extremely important,
circadian system trying figure time. - Exactly. - Not
space. - Sorry, said, time. - Yeah. - mean are. -
Oh no, no, wasn't correcting you. just meant think fundamentally
incredible thing system. - Absolutely. - clock, 24 hour
clock brain, needs synchronized outside. go little


deeper circadian setting behavior come general rules
thumb? So, say bright day. - Mm hm, mm hm. - Extremely bright. No
clouds, sun's out. said 10 minutes, 15 minutes. - tell
sensitive, don't even go sun. shade. going
many photons shade. going perfect. don't even
see sun. don't sun. know, great vitamin D,
different story. skin protect skin. not
area expertise, effect circadian system, long
outside shade sunny day, 10 15 minutes ample amount. -
Okay say kind overcast. know, not particularly bright
solid cloud cover, obviously sun out, not bright. long
think take set clock? - 10 15 sufficient. Stay half
hour. Stay 45 minutes. darker out, stay longer. - Okay
reason, one finds far north, very, dense cloud cover.
long point somebody consider using artificial light source mimic
sunlight? - Yeah, honestly, don't lot information still,
going discuss maybe detail, put
humans artificial conditions, circadian system sensitive light,
reality, real environment, light also affecting aspects independent
setting circadian pacemaker. - Okay. - call direct
effect light mood, example. So, hard figure intensity
need use. haven't done enough experiments 'cause system
discovered just recently. say use bright light morning,
mean, hard give numbers.

00:30:20 Sunlight Simulators, Afternoon Light Viewing, Naps

can get complicated. yeah, mean, honestly, far north
winter make sure don't, use light boxes. suggest
personally, it. - use, actually not designed circadian setting,
930 lux light pad bought bought it, affordable compared
dawn simulating lights. - Yeah, don't need them. - quite expensive,
frankly. - Yeah. - put there. so, just basically, wake morning,
use sun comes out, make sure sun out, go


outside. keep thing day. don't know good bad. good
bad? - I, honestly, don't think exposed bright light day going ever
bad really outside day... Unless, know, worst
going happen temperature high, body's going say don't dehydrate
go sleep. tell actually sometimes hot,
get exposed bright light, sleepier feel afternoon, counter-
intuitive. - Mm hm. protect us, think, dehydration? - think
think human evolution near equator noon certain
time afternoon, hard maintain physiological
homeostatic function, active high temperature time. think napping
way, think major function still... Napping way
somehow take away dangerous zone. maybe people
north say, winter can't wake morning 'cause don't
long light. So, sleep night. summer say, feel like can't
go sleep. put dark curtains. So, think, venturing much
north been... Came problem evolution used certain light
environment completely changed human. animals, think
lived longer, come interesting adaptation actually
measuring even small changes light intensities still occur. so, even
near poles, even though always light, change light
intensity across day-night cycle. So, system, linear, remember told
ipRCGs incredibly linear, can still measure, oh, lower light higher
light organism ability that. - see, yeah, interesting. spent
much time learning fortunately cells, yet never really
appreciated now one hand tracking amount light
understand time relative 24 hour cycle, also keep
mentioning linear measurement intensity; really trying figure
time measuring intensity light. course sun
intense source light available us. So, okay, think nailed
first part day. - Exactly. - Basically get 10 30 minutes depending
bright is, try often possible give system regular source- -
Daily best. system really about, see even effect
depression, multiple days is. don't worry missed one
day,



00:33:48 Jetlagged Home? Chronotypes & Early Risers Succeed

stay longer want. hurry want stuff,
great recommendation. - Mm hm, might want compensate extra
time missed day two. - Absolutely. - heard say before,
entirely possible get severely jet lagged without traveling. - Absolutely. - Simply
staying in, phone much, not getting sunlight. - Absolutely.
saw pandemic. lot people mentioned sleep-wake cycles
suffered lot. not going staying home
don't big windows waking late, waking late, using
bright light late night, body going shift. now, day going
start instead like really sun comes up, say six o'clock
morning, day going start 11 o'clock morning.
body's going think beginning day. So, not going able
sleep 10 o'clock night, now really body, completely
different timing. see happen pandemic high
scale. People get delayed sleep-wake cycle lot. - idea
chronotypes, intrinsically best rhythm either morning
person. - Absolutely. - called early person, night owl,
kind standard bed around 10:30, around 7:00 type thing. think
now good data, correct wrong, National Institutes Mental Health
elsewhere showing deviate intrinsic rhythm, mental
health issues physical health issues start crop up. - So, great data this,
couple things complicate this. first people usually
late, tell society doesn't accommodate. - late,
mean? People wake late go sleep late? - Go sleep late wake
late. overwhelmingly higher level depression failures. mean,
clearly, mean, reason people say sleep early, wake early, better
human notice people go sleep early wake early,
better life. notice that. - just perform better? - perform,
question is, intrinsic system society society start things
usually early late? hard question ask- - discriminate late risers.
- way, discriminate, right? explanation Ken Wright's experiment.


late riser, truly chronotypically late, shift easily
put the... really chronotypically late, phase
relation light-dark environment circadian clock,
camping experiment not caused much changes not light
going affect certain way, relationship body
decided late sleeper, late waking. So, honestly, still unable figure
much late waking controlled light environment much
intrinsic. sure differences, big see
environment? people go off sleep 7:00 p.m. wake
1:00 a.m.. clearly advanced phase- - people go sleep 7:00 p.m.
wake 1:00 a.m.? - Yeah. - feel good that? - not sure feel
good, lot time talk people, say high achievers,
suffer go 7:00 p.m., wake advanced phase sleep syndrome.
call syndrome, people not able sleep till 5:00
a.m., not able wake till 3:00 p.m., right? not sure
circadian system variable human population. mean, clearly
maybe genetic factors make small percentage like everything bell
shape. think time, light environment may play role. once,
talked about, long-term effect light. get rhythm,
don't mean pun, reality, get rhythm, hard break
rhythm start sleeping late waking late, not getting
morning sunlight. - Right. - so, just going late. like
waking early, getting morning sunlight. getting Zeitzer said...
said last name wrong. one Stanford the- - Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah. -
Zeitzer, yeah. - [Andrew] actually worked for- - Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer. So, Zeitzer
Czeisler. - Yeah, confusing.

00:38:33 Decide Best Sleep-Wake Schedule; Minimal Light Test

- Yeah, lot zz's i's names. - Yeah. - phenomenal
scientists. - Yeah. - seems case way really know
meant early bird call it, early person late person,
somewhere get morning sunlight, figure whether not
makes feel better. - understand, educated measure


intensity. "How measure" put quotation 'cause either get measuring device,
cannot depend eye measure intensity. - Okay, that?
'Cause keep coming back this. So, tells important. -
important. - So, obviously, apps, free apps like Light Meter, can
walk around hold button see many lux environment. -
complicated point specific regions. - Right. So,
people start develop intuitive sense measurement intensity? -
Yeah, think one point posted Instagram, keep nighttime home.
found night vision strong. found I, especially
winter, need candle lights. literally use tea lights, put like 15 20
them- - romantic. - nice. see clearly doesn't affect
circadian system. - cats- - wife. - wife course. - just
great, right? don't expect people night vision me. So, mean,
tell people, experiment. put three four lights room, switch two,
sit 15 minutes. - Switch two off? - Switch two off. say using five. see,
15 minutes, will not recognize switched two off. gut feeling
people need least 10 times less light use night see.
problem people use time didn't see morning sunlight.
actually hungry light without knowledge. come switch
lights on, wrong time. woke late. - Okay, now understand.
So, morning light viewing goes way beyond- - Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting
clock. also way determine little light need later day. - Exactly. -
going talk moment, little light get later day
strong determinant things like will wake up, whether not
wake feeling refreshed, et cetera. move- - why, - Yeah? - going
break show, Andrew, going tell you, think something else
people need think about, tripartite model. model
incorporate three components talk details allows us humans
animals incorporate circadian clock, relation light, homeostatic
drive, direct effect environment, includes stress, light, kinds
stuff. incorporated together. think, think right now,
think one alone, will always miss something. think
whole, things really become clear. actually quite amazing. - Okay, well, will
definitely want hear tripartite theory go detail


homeostatic mechanisms. want make sure people thinking now,
sure light impacts them. morning light viewing behavior, like
think tacked clearly. - Absolutely. - thank
much information tried relay information. course,
primary source things circadian, well Jamie others,

00:42:16 Viewing Light Middle Day: Mood & “Light Hunger”

course, Matt Walker. think made very, clear. Now, say
gotten morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe bright artificial light,
throughout day said get lot light. So, working desk. Maybe go
day times, working computer, things.
anything light viewing middle day people keep mind?
can just sort freestyle depending doing? people not
dark room throughout day- - Yeah, gut feeling, got morning
sunlight, walk car slowly walk work, didn't wear sunglasses
lights still dim morning, freestyle it. even
don't get lot light, way just... day, don't just worry
getting lot bright light, personally, like that. go lunch
lunch outside well. reminds body even brighter now.
evidence literally help circadian clock giving lights
dawn dusk. again, think tripartite model, may important
circadian clock, important mood? think need,
homeostatic drive. need think it. So, clock,
entraining clock, literally can entrain dawn sunlight. actually
don't need dawn dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah appreciate
distinguishing circadian effects effects lights. - Yes. -
precise, appreciated. hear tripartite model,
will cover, sake discussion, treat light viewing behavior
benefits drawbacks viewing light biological purposes, not just
circadian settings? So, morning, clearly going set clock. then,
day, understand correctly, idea get much bright light can,
feeding, sounds like sort light hunger. - Exactly. - see. - love
way put it. think weird light hunger considering not


photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.

sleep-wake cycle. sleep awake sleep 24 hour rhythms.
measure sleep-wake cycle humans maintaining constant
conditions, will see period length sleep rhythm average
24 hours. humans 24.2 hours. drifting .2 hours every day
solar day don't get sunlight. sunlight adjusts approximate day
exact day, now behavior adjusted light-dark environment solar
day. - Okay, understand correctly, go cave- - Yeah. -
constant light. - Yeah. - didn't close eyes- - Yeah. - constant light,
still sleep one coherent about. - Yes. - still awake
less one coherent about, maybe nap. - Yes. - total duration day,
speak, little bit longer 24 hours? - Perfect. - condition like
people sun goes sun goes down,
understanding sunrise sunset, then- - don't understanding,
don't conscious understanding. detection. - Right. - So,
circadian photoentrainment word use, entraining circadian clock
photic environment completely subconscious. not aware it. not like vision
image forming, actually know looking at. So,
hypothalamic. part brain not consciously driven. So, actually not
know happens doesn't happen. get
tell light affects mood sometimes people don't know deal
light improve mood, example. - Okay, subconscious vision. -
Yes. - Okay. tell us light impacts mood, curious,
relevance adjusting clock little bit longer 24 hours 24 hours?
mean, seems like small difference, 24 hours 40 minutes 24 hours. Like
relevance? mean, care short difference? - So,
math. shift .2 hours day, five days shifting one hour.
literally one hour off social behavior five days. 10 days, two hours off.
organism living wild, shifting right phase
cycle, either miss food become food. really essential
survival. think one strongest aspect survival animals
anticipation adjustment solar cycle. - humans well.
say animals, assuming applies us? - Absolutely, yeah. - see. even though
just short bit longer 24, accumulates days, find
much phase rest species essentially. - Yeah,


say .2 hours. So, five days one hour. 25 days five six hours.
New York feeling traveled New York
London. So, jet lag New York, even though didn't jet lag
travel. important adjustment. time, maybe
talk important seasonality, also allows animals
anticipate change season. high north south,
weather changes occur harshly, ready
them. happens us well. - right, well, will definitely get
seasonality. Okay, got subconscious vision aligns us turn
earth. work? machinery allows happen?
machinery work? - Yeah, so, knew mammals, including us,
mammals, humans, eyes required function. So, humans
born without eyes, optic nerves damaged, humans not able adjust
solar cycle. know eyes required. since thought knew
eyes lot 2000, thought that- - say year 2000? -
year 2000, yes. - Mm hm, yep. - thought photoreceptors
retina allow see. So, human retinas, two types
photoreceptors; called rods cones shapes. rods
cones simply take photon energy, light made of, change
way electrical signal allow us build image environment
cortices. - Subconsciously? - Consciously situation cause vision, right?
image forming vision, visual cortex, associative cortices, allow
build conscious perception environment. However, people found, including
work David Berson Ignacio Provencio, subset
ganglion cells. ganglion cells cells leave retina, axon leave
retina project brain. thought relay rod cone
information light environment brain. found small subset
ganglion cells photoreceptors completely missed
retina. photoreceptors relay light environment subconsciously
areas brain house circadian clock circadian
pacemaker, adjusts clocks bodies central brain clock
allows entrain 24 hour light-dark cycle.

00:14:30 Neurons Eyes Set Body Clocks: Similar Frog Skin



- Incredible. So, recall 'cause graduate student time, year 2000,
landmark discovery made you, Ignacio Provencio, David Berson,
others, cells exists can communicate day night information
brain. - Yeah. - small subset cells. Since then, heard, maybe
can confirm refute system connects eyes rest brain
actually ancient form vision. probably form vision
early version human beings pattern vision,
see colors shapes motion that. cells
perform role actually similar insect eyes. think heard David Berson say
actually little bit fly eye eye. talking about? -
Yeah. So, really interesting actually, ipRCGs discovered
contribute little bit image formation. now, work Tiffany Schmidt
specifically proven contribute image forming functions.
contribute limited aspect image formation. So, fits hypothesis
ancient photoreceptors. thing adds hypothesis
expressed cells don't modification make look like
photoreceptors. So, photoreceptors told important vision,
image formation, specialized structures allow pack
structures photopigments; photo-detecting proteins,
detect high sensitivity photons pass them. new photoreceptors
don't specialized structures. just really need lot light time,
thought need lot light activated. think
ancient. think adjust ancient functions important
regulating body circadian clock solar environment, solar day light-
dark cycle. - So, mentioned ipRCGs, intrinsically photosensitive. cells
connect eye brain behave like photoreceptors. - Right. - Essentially.
mentioned melanopsin, actual pigment converts light
electrical signal- - Yeah. - less. understanding
melanopsin identified first frog melanophores. - Yes. - mean
like little pieces frog skin eyes? - So, honestly, David Berson say
fly eye sounds better. accurate think
frog skin eye. not catchy, really, name melanopsin
melanocyte opsin, melanopsin found frog melanocytes.


know frogs can change color depending light melanopsin drives
response. Ignacio Provencio first discovered opsins frogs, luckily
smart enough see expressed frog eye. expressed
frog eye appears retinal ganglion cells, told you, one
connects eye brain. insight go see
expressed monkey eye. found also expressed
appears retinal ganglion cells, really opened field wide open.
David Berson seminal experiment went brain
central oscillator, oscillator drives circadian rhythm brain called
suprachiasmatic nucleus, known many years receive retinal input.
labeled cells project there. found even destroy
rods cones, get light responses cells. imagine
nearly fainted saw cells can respond independent, completely
absence rod cone input. - Yeah, never forget reading papers 2000,
2001. meeting DC Ignacio, Iggy, call Iggy, showed
image basically frog melanophores human eye. - Yes. - [Andrew]
everyone like, "oh goodness, thing." - Yeah. - want get
light

00:18:55 Blind People See

actually can control circadian rhythms. moment. - Absolutely. - think worth
mentioning now people pattern vision blind, people cannot see
no conscious vision, eyes, many still cells;
melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive cells, can essentially match entrain,
say, onto light-dark cycle. - fact, possibly no problems circadian
photoentrainment, normal sleep-wake cycle. - totally blind? -
totally image blind. really interesting that, story
heard Chuck Czeisler, give credit, people
image blind, usually get dry eyes give lot pain. doctors used
think, oh, since image blind getting dry eye, don't just
remove eyes? not using anymore. minute remove
eyes, start cyclical sleep problems indicating now not
entraining light-dark cycle cyclical jet lags clock shifts


light-dark cycle. - really interesting. hear number blind
people various aspects job, lot issues sleep. think,
part don't realize

00:20:15 When, & Long View Light Optimal Sleep & Wakefulness

need see light particular times day night order match schedule. -
Absolutely. - Well, think perfect segue us talk light viewing
light can impact sleep-wake rhythms. move
ways light can impact forms bodily function. - Yeah, love way
set one interesting difficult aspect trying educate
people light effect subconscious vision subconscious.
aware think intensity see room, talk people
know take photographs stuff like that, know intensities
varies greatly. system, see way bright
conditions dim conditions, not good estimating intensity
consciously. try tell people intensity, really struggle
think know intensity, really don't. - mean light intensity? - Light
intensity. - Yeah. - cones incredible ability adapt
different light conditions. can see different conditions. Otherwise it'd
disaster. don't change setting camera go inside room
outside, becomes completely white, don't see anything. cones
don't adapt environment, not going able see room
beach, right? problem ipRCGs, cells talked about,
measure intensity pretty well. really know intensity is. good
linear measurement intensity. don't adapt well. don't adapt actually
much, honest. tells subconsciously system used
measuring light intensity natural environment, now
natural environment, don't industrialized lighting, system
functioning well. now change environments, really
mess ourselves. teach people understand intensity.
something explain people. think love myself.
called lowest amount light required allow see comfortably.
fun experiment. - Okay, explain goes.


maybe break day three four parts. say assuming
people wake morning- - Mm hm. - opposed night shift workers, et
cetera, talk later. - Right. - wake morning,
divide day quarters. proper way interact light first part
day? - So, honestly think easiest thing waking up, get much light
can. - eyes? - Yeah, really nice. system prime. entrained,
prime get light, sun out. animals wild, actually seem
track sun. sun huge influence life earth. actually life earth
sun. So, easy. morning wake up, need light. Just
get light. - Okay, behavioral practice recommend? say
somebody condition lot cloud cover. - Yeah. - important
get outside? - So, tell you, cloudiest day going much brighter
room. ask photographer. cloudy day, unless really dark,
dark clouds, usually cloudy days much light outside inside room,
even good lighting inside room. think outside usually
even cloudy, going get enough intensity help adjust
cycle day-night cycle. - So, long you... general rules thumb,
long recommend people go outside? - So, daily, possibly
need few. daily, remember thing going happen
daily matter. So, say 15 minutes. - So, clock tracking regular basis? -
Absolutely. photon counting, tracking. say 15 minutes. don't
daily, may want increase it. talk travel,
do, yeah, 15 minutes fine. more, doesn't hurt. -
window, understanding window, dramatically decreases
amount light energy coming in. - depends thick windows
dark are. So, also nice go outside feel seasons. - Sunglasses
off? - don't use sunglasses. - Yeah, Jordanian photopigment. - Yeah,
yeah, right. - know, so, yeah. Whereas eyes sensitive, right? -
No, personally, shade not incredibly bright, try to, especially
morning, also early person. differentiate early- -
time wake up? - wake 4:30 morning. - sun isn't yet.
- not yet, it's- - So, do? turn artificial lights? - usually
don't turn artificial light know sun going come eventually,
don't like change timing do. - Wait,


4:30 a.m. 7:00 a.m.? - mean, look computer, phone. - Oh,
see. - possibly get enough light, reality, mean long let body
get morning sunlight, think really, no evidence this,
me, look animals, plants, morning sunlight seems
important. don't experiments show it, gut feeling
huge impact humans. - Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab Stanford Sleep Lab
shown early morning light flashes can adjust total amount sleep- -
Absolutely. - one will get. makes easier get sleep. - Absolutely,
absolutely. Ken Wright also beautiful camping experiments showed
that- - Maybe describe 'cause beautiful experiments. - Oh,
yeah, beautiful experiments. took college students late
onset sleep late waking time, said, go camping just don't
use artificial light go sleep late early want,
wake late early. found huge shift sleep pattern just
exposing light-dark cycle. mean, so- - lasted. - lasted,
yeah. - Even came back. - Exactly. - two days camping reset
circadian clock? - Seven days, lasted. Yeah, pretty amazing. Yeah, really
incredible. - Okay, get bright light sort early day, ideally sunlight, even
cloudy day, going be- - Absolutely. - Brighter indoor light. -
easy. - Okay, then- - thing like mention people,
think dim outside, say cloudy, stay longer. remember intensity
one component. Duration also important remember circadian
system not like image system. image system change every
second looking different objects. change perception.
circadian system trying figure day-night cycle?
give information, better are. So, bright,
don't need lot clearly going make fire like crazy. not bright,
stay longer, stay one hour. know, coffee outside something like
that. just going help. - think said something extremely important,
circadian system trying figure time. - Exactly. - Not
space. - Sorry, said, time. - Yeah. - mean are. -
Oh no, no, wasn't correcting you. just meant think fundamentally
incredible thing system. - Absolutely. - clock, 24 hour
clock brain, needs synchronized outside. go little


deeper circadian setting behavior come general rules
thumb? So, say bright day. - Mm hm, mm hm. - Extremely bright. No
clouds, sun's out. said 10 minutes, 15 minutes. - tell
sensitive, don't even go sun. shade. going
many photons shade. going perfect. don't even
see sun. don't sun. know, great vitamin D,
different story. skin protect skin. not
area expertise, effect circadian system, long
outside shade sunny day, 10 15 minutes ample amount. -
Okay say kind overcast. know, not particularly bright
solid cloud cover, obviously sun out, not bright. long
think take set clock? - 10 15 sufficient. Stay half
hour. Stay 45 minutes. darker out, stay longer. - Okay
reason, one finds far north, very, dense cloud cover.
long point somebody consider using artificial light source mimic
sunlight? - Yeah, honestly, don't lot information still,
going discuss maybe detail, put
humans artificial conditions, circadian system sensitive light,
reality, real environment, light also affecting aspects independent
setting circadian pacemaker. - Okay. - call direct
effect light mood, example. So, hard figure intensity
need use. haven't done enough experiments 'cause system
discovered just recently. say use bright light morning,
mean, hard give numbers.

00:30:20 Sunlight Simulators, Afternoon Light Viewing, Naps

can get complicated. yeah, mean, honestly, far north
winter make sure don't, use light boxes. suggest
personally, it. - use, actually not designed circadian setting,
930 lux light pad bought bought it, affordable compared
dawn simulating lights. - Yeah, don't need them. - quite expensive,
frankly. - Yeah. - put there. so, just basically, wake morning,
use sun comes out, make sure sun out, go


outside. keep thing day. don't know good bad. good
bad? - I, honestly, don't think exposed bright light day going ever
bad really outside day... Unless, know, worst
going happen temperature high, body's going say don't dehydrate
go sleep. tell actually sometimes hot,
get exposed bright light, sleepier feel afternoon, counter-
intuitive. - Mm hm. protect us, think, dehydration? - think
think human evolution near equator noon certain
time afternoon, hard maintain physiological
homeostatic function, active high temperature time. think napping
way, think major function still... Napping way
somehow take away dangerous zone. maybe people
north say, winter can't wake morning 'cause don't
long light. So, sleep night. summer say, feel like can't
go sleep. put dark curtains. So, think, venturing much
north been... Came problem evolution used certain light
environment completely changed human. animals, think
lived longer, come interesting adaptation actually
measuring even small changes light intensities still occur. so, even
near poles, even though always light, change light
intensity across day-night cycle. So, system, linear, remember told
ipRCGs incredibly linear, can still measure, oh, lower light higher
light organism ability that. - see, yeah, interesting. spent
much time learning fortunately cells, yet never really
appreciated now one hand tracking amount light
understand time relative 24 hour cycle, also keep
mentioning linear measurement intensity; really trying figure
time measuring intensity light. course sun
intense source light available us. So, okay, think nailed
first part day. - Exactly. - Basically get 10 30 minutes depending
bright is, try often possible give system regular source- -
Daily best. system really about, see even effect
depression, multiple days is. don't worry missed one
day,



00:33:48 Jetlagged Home? Chronotypes & Early Risers Succeed

stay longer want. hurry want stuff,
great recommendation. - Mm hm, might want compensate extra
time missed day two. - Absolutely. - heard say before,
entirely possible get severely jet lagged without traveling. - Absolutely. - Simply
staying in, phone much, not getting sunlight. - Absolutely.
saw pandemic. lot people mentioned sleep-wake cycles
suffered lot. not going staying home
don't big windows waking late, waking late, using
bright light late night, body going shift. now, day going
start instead like really sun comes up, say six o'clock
morning, day going start 11 o'clock morning.
body's going think beginning day. So, not going able
sleep 10 o'clock night, now really body, completely
different timing. see happen pandemic high
scale. People get delayed sleep-wake cycle lot. - idea
chronotypes, intrinsically best rhythm either morning
person. - Absolutely. - called early person, night owl,
kind standard bed around 10:30, around 7:00 type thing. think
now good data, correct wrong, National Institutes Mental Health
elsewhere showing deviate intrinsic rhythm, mental
health issues physical health issues start crop up. - So, great data this,
couple things complicate this. first people usually
late, tell society doesn't accommodate. - late,
mean? People wake late go sleep late? - Go sleep late wake
late. overwhelmingly higher level depression failures. mean,
clearly, mean, reason people say sleep early, wake early, better
human notice people go sleep early wake early,
better life. notice that. - just perform better? - perform,
question is, intrinsic system society society start things
usually early late? hard question ask- - discriminate late risers.
- way, discriminate, right? explanation Ken Wright's experiment.


late riser, truly chronotypically late, shift easily
put the... really chronotypically late, phase
relation light-dark environment circadian clock,
camping experiment not caused much changes not light
going affect certain way, relationship body
decided late sleeper, late waking. So, honestly, still unable figure
much late waking controlled light environment much
intrinsic. sure differences, big see
environment? people go off sleep 7:00 p.m. wake
1:00 a.m.. clearly advanced phase- - people go sleep 7:00 p.m.
wake 1:00 a.m.? - Yeah. - feel good that? - not sure feel
good, lot time talk people, say high achievers,
suffer go 7:00 p.m., wake advanced phase sleep syndrome.
call syndrome, people not able sleep till 5:00
a.m., not able wake till 3:00 p.m., right? not sure
circadian system variable human population. mean, clearly
maybe genetic factors make small percentage like everything bell
shape. think time, light environment may play role. once,
talked about, long-term effect light. get rhythm,
don't mean pun, reality, get rhythm, hard break
rhythm start sleeping late waking late, not getting
morning sunlight. - Right. - so, just going late. like
waking early, getting morning sunlight. getting Zeitzer said...
said last name wrong. one Stanford the- - Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah. -
Zeitzer, yeah. - [Andrew] actually worked for- - Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer. So, Zeitzer
Czeisler. - Yeah, confusing.

00:38:33 Decide Best Sleep-Wake Schedule; Minimal Light Test

- Yeah, lot zz's i's names. - Yeah. - phenomenal
scientists. - Yeah. - seems case way really know
meant early bird call it, early person late person,
somewhere get morning sunlight, figure whether not
makes feel better. - understand, educated measure


intensity. "How measure" put quotation 'cause either get measuring device,
cannot depend eye measure intensity. - Okay, that?
'Cause keep coming back this. So, tells important. -
important. - So, obviously, apps, free apps like Light Meter, can
walk around hold button see many lux environment. -
complicated point specific regions. - Right. So,
people start develop intuitive sense measurement intensity? -
Yeah, think one point posted Instagram, keep nighttime home.
found night vision strong. found I, especially
winter, need candle lights. literally use tea lights, put like 15 20
them- - romantic. - nice. see clearly doesn't affect
circadian system. - cats- - wife. - wife course. - just
great, right? don't expect people night vision me. So, mean,
tell people, experiment. put three four lights room, switch two,
sit 15 minutes. - Switch two off? - Switch two off. say using five. see,
15 minutes, will not recognize switched two off. gut feeling
people need least 10 times less light use night see.
problem people use time didn't see morning sunlight.
actually hungry light without knowledge. come switch
lights on, wrong time. woke late. - Okay, now understand.
So, morning light viewing goes way beyond- - Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting
clock. also way determine little light need later day. - Exactly. -
going talk moment, little light get later day
strong determinant things like will wake up, whether not
wake feeling refreshed, et cetera. move- - why, - Yeah? - going
break show, Andrew, going tell you, think something else
people need think about, tripartite model. model
incorporate three components talk details allows us humans
animals incorporate circadian clock, relation light, homeostatic
drive, direct effect environment, includes stress, light, kinds
stuff. incorporated together. think, think right now,
think one alone, will always miss something. think
whole, things really become clear. actually quite amazing. - Okay, well, will
definitely want hear tripartite theory go detail


homeostatic mechanisms. want make sure people thinking now,
sure light impacts them. morning light viewing behavior, like
think tacked clearly. - Absolutely. - thank
much information tried relay information. course,
primary source things circadian, well Jamie others,

00:42:16 Viewing Light Middle Day: Mood & “Light Hunger”

course, Matt Walker. think made very, clear. Now, say
gotten morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe bright artificial light,
throughout day said get lot light. So, working desk. Maybe go
day times, working computer, things.
anything light viewing middle day people keep mind?
can just sort freestyle depending doing? people not
dark room throughout day- - Yeah, gut feeling, got morning
sunlight, walk car slowly walk work, didn't wear sunglasses
lights still dim morning, freestyle it. even
don't get lot light, way just... day, don't just worry
getting lot bright light, personally, like that. go lunch
lunch outside well. reminds body even brighter now.
evidence literally help circadian clock giving lights
dawn dusk. again, think tripartite model, may important
circadian clock, important mood? think need,
homeostatic drive. need think it. So, clock,
entraining clock, literally can entrain dawn sunlight. actually
don't need dawn dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah appreciate
distinguishing circadian effects effects lights. - Yes. -
precise, appreciated. hear tripartite model,
will cover, sake discussion, treat light viewing behavior
benefits drawbacks viewing light biological purposes, not just
circadian settings? So, morning, clearly going set clock. then,
day, understand correctly, idea get much bright light can,
feeding, sounds like sort light hunger. - Exactly. - see. - love
way put it. think weird light hunger considering not


photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.

say .2 hours. So, five days one hour. 25 days five six hours.
New York feeling traveled New York
London. So, jet lag New York, even though didn't jet lag
travel. important adjustment. time, maybe
talk important seasonality, also allows animals
anticipate change season. high north south,
weather changes occur harshly, ready
them. happens us well. - right, well, will definitely get
seasonality. Okay, got subconscious vision aligns us turn
earth. work? machinery allows happen?
machinery work? - Yeah, so, knew mammals, including us,
mammals, humans, eyes required function. So, humans
born without eyes, optic nerves damaged, humans not able adjust
solar cycle. know eyes required. since thought knew
eyes lot 2000, thought that- - say year 2000? -
year 2000, yes. - Mm hm, yep. - thought photoreceptors
retina allow see. So, human retinas, two types
photoreceptors; called rods cones shapes. rods
cones simply take photon energy, light made of, change
way electrical signal allow us build image environment
cortices. - Subconsciously? - Consciously situation cause vision, right?
image forming vision, visual cortex, associative cortices, allow
build conscious perception environment. However, people found, including
work David Berson Ignacio Provencio, subset
ganglion cells. ganglion cells cells leave retina, axon leave
retina project brain. thought relay rod cone
information light environment brain. found small subset
ganglion cells photoreceptors completely missed
retina. photoreceptors relay light environment subconsciously
areas brain house circadian clock circadian
pacemaker, adjusts clocks bodies central brain clock
allows entrain 24 hour light-dark cycle.

00:14:30 Neurons Eyes Set Body Clocks: Similar Frog Skin



- Incredible. So, recall 'cause graduate student time, year 2000,
landmark discovery made you, Ignacio Provencio, David Berson,
others, cells exists can communicate day night information
brain. - Yeah. - small subset cells. Since then, heard, maybe
can confirm refute system connects eyes rest brain
actually ancient form vision. probably form vision
early version human beings pattern vision,
see colors shapes motion that. cells
perform role actually similar insect eyes. think heard David Berson say
actually little bit fly eye eye. talking about? -
Yeah. So, really interesting actually, ipRCGs discovered
contribute little bit image formation. now, work Tiffany Schmidt
specifically proven contribute image forming functions.
contribute limited aspect image formation. So, fits hypothesis
ancient photoreceptors. thing adds hypothesis
expressed cells don't modification make look like
photoreceptors. So, photoreceptors told important vision,
image formation, specialized structures allow pack
structures photopigments; photo-detecting proteins,
detect high sensitivity photons pass them. new photoreceptors
don't specialized structures. just really need lot light time,
thought need lot light activated. think
ancient. think adjust ancient functions important
regulating body circadian clock solar environment, solar day light-
dark cycle. - So, mentioned ipRCGs, intrinsically photosensitive. cells
connect eye brain behave like photoreceptors. - Right. - Essentially.
mentioned melanopsin, actual pigment converts light
electrical signal- - Yeah. - less. understanding
melanopsin identified first frog melanophores. - Yes. - mean
like little pieces frog skin eyes? - So, honestly, David Berson say
fly eye sounds better. accurate think
frog skin eye. not catchy, really, name melanopsin
melanocyte opsin, melanopsin found frog melanocytes.


know frogs can change color depending light melanopsin drives
response. Ignacio Provencio first discovered opsins frogs, luckily
smart enough see expressed frog eye. expressed
frog eye appears retinal ganglion cells, told you, one
connects eye brain. insight go see
expressed monkey eye. found also expressed
appears retinal ganglion cells, really opened field wide open.
David Berson seminal experiment went brain
central oscillator, oscillator drives circadian rhythm brain called
suprachiasmatic nucleus, known many years receive retinal input.
labeled cells project there. found even destroy
rods cones, get light responses cells. imagine
nearly fainted saw cells can respond independent, completely
absence rod cone input. - Yeah, never forget reading papers 2000,
2001. meeting DC Ignacio, Iggy, call Iggy, showed
image basically frog melanophores human eye. - Yes. - [Andrew]
everyone like, "oh goodness, thing." - Yeah. - want get
light

00:18:55 Blind People See

actually can control circadian rhythms. moment. - Absolutely. - think worth
mentioning now people pattern vision blind, people cannot see
no conscious vision, eyes, many still cells;
melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive cells, can essentially match entrain,
say, onto light-dark cycle. - fact, possibly no problems circadian
photoentrainment, normal sleep-wake cycle. - totally blind? -
totally image blind. really interesting that, story
heard Chuck Czeisler, give credit, people
image blind, usually get dry eyes give lot pain. doctors used
think, oh, since image blind getting dry eye, don't just
remove eyes? not using anymore. minute remove
eyes, start cyclical sleep problems indicating now not
entraining light-dark cycle cyclical jet lags clock shifts


light-dark cycle. - really interesting. hear number blind
people various aspects job, lot issues sleep. think,
part don't realize

00:20:15 When, & Long View Light Optimal Sleep & Wakefulness

need see light particular times day night order match schedule. -
Absolutely. - Well, think perfect segue us talk light viewing
light can impact sleep-wake rhythms. move
ways light can impact forms bodily function. - Yeah, love way
set one interesting difficult aspect trying educate
people light effect subconscious vision subconscious.
aware think intensity see room, talk people
know take photographs stuff like that, know intensities
varies greatly. system, see way bright
conditions dim conditions, not good estimating intensity
consciously. try tell people intensity, really struggle
think know intensity, really don't. - mean light intensity? - Light
intensity. - Yeah. - cones incredible ability adapt
different light conditions. can see different conditions. Otherwise it'd
disaster. don't change setting camera go inside room
outside, becomes completely white, don't see anything. cones
don't adapt environment, not going able see room
beach, right? problem ipRCGs, cells talked about,
measure intensity pretty well. really know intensity is. good
linear measurement intensity. don't adapt well. don't adapt actually
much, honest. tells subconsciously system used
measuring light intensity natural environment, now
natural environment, don't industrialized lighting, system
functioning well. now change environments, really
mess ourselves. teach people understand intensity.
something explain people. think love myself.
called lowest amount light required allow see comfortably.
fun experiment. - Okay, explain goes.


maybe break day three four parts. say assuming
people wake morning- - Mm hm. - opposed night shift workers, et
cetera, talk later. - Right. - wake morning,
divide day quarters. proper way interact light first part
day? - So, honestly think easiest thing waking up, get much light
can. - eyes? - Yeah, really nice. system prime. entrained,
prime get light, sun out. animals wild, actually seem
track sun. sun huge influence life earth. actually life earth
sun. So, easy. morning wake up, need light. Just
get light. - Okay, behavioral practice recommend? say
somebody condition lot cloud cover. - Yeah. - important
get outside? - So, tell you, cloudiest day going much brighter
room. ask photographer. cloudy day, unless really dark,
dark clouds, usually cloudy days much light outside inside room,
even good lighting inside room. think outside usually
even cloudy, going get enough intensity help adjust
cycle day-night cycle. - So, long you... general rules thumb,
long recommend people go outside? - So, daily, possibly
need few. daily, remember thing going happen
daily matter. So, say 15 minutes. - So, clock tracking regular basis? -
Absolutely. photon counting, tracking. say 15 minutes. don't
daily, may want increase it. talk travel,
do, yeah, 15 minutes fine. more, doesn't hurt. -
window, understanding window, dramatically decreases
amount light energy coming in. - depends thick windows
dark are. So, also nice go outside feel seasons. - Sunglasses
off? - don't use sunglasses. - Yeah, Jordanian photopigment. - Yeah,
yeah, right. - know, so, yeah. Whereas eyes sensitive, right? -
No, personally, shade not incredibly bright, try to, especially
morning, also early person. differentiate early- -
time wake up? - wake 4:30 morning. - sun isn't yet.
- not yet, it's- - So, do? turn artificial lights? - usually
don't turn artificial light know sun going come eventually,
don't like change timing do. - Wait,


4:30 a.m. 7:00 a.m.? - mean, look computer, phone. - Oh,
see. - possibly get enough light, reality, mean long let body
get morning sunlight, think really, no evidence this,
me, look animals, plants, morning sunlight seems
important. don't experiments show it, gut feeling
huge impact humans. - Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab Stanford Sleep Lab
shown early morning light flashes can adjust total amount sleep- -
Absolutely. - one will get. makes easier get sleep. - Absolutely,
absolutely. Ken Wright also beautiful camping experiments showed
that- - Maybe describe 'cause beautiful experiments. - Oh,
yeah, beautiful experiments. took college students late
onset sleep late waking time, said, go camping just don't
use artificial light go sleep late early want,
wake late early. found huge shift sleep pattern just
exposing light-dark cycle. mean, so- - lasted. - lasted,
yeah. - Even came back. - Exactly. - two days camping reset
circadian clock? - Seven days, lasted. Yeah, pretty amazing. Yeah, really
incredible. - Okay, get bright light sort early day, ideally sunlight, even
cloudy day, going be- - Absolutely. - Brighter indoor light. -
easy. - Okay, then- - thing like mention people,
think dim outside, say cloudy, stay longer. remember intensity
one component. Duration also important remember circadian
system not like image system. image system change every
second looking different objects. change perception.
circadian system trying figure day-night cycle?
give information, better are. So, bright,
don't need lot clearly going make fire like crazy. not bright,
stay longer, stay one hour. know, coffee outside something like
that. just going help. - think said something extremely important,
circadian system trying figure time. - Exactly. - Not
space. - Sorry, said, time. - Yeah. - mean are. -
Oh no, no, wasn't correcting you. just meant think fundamentally
incredible thing system. - Absolutely. - clock, 24 hour
clock brain, needs synchronized outside. go little


deeper circadian setting behavior come general rules
thumb? So, say bright day. - Mm hm, mm hm. - Extremely bright. No
clouds, sun's out. said 10 minutes, 15 minutes. - tell
sensitive, don't even go sun. shade. going
many photons shade. going perfect. don't even
see sun. don't sun. know, great vitamin D,
different story. skin protect skin. not
area expertise, effect circadian system, long
outside shade sunny day, 10 15 minutes ample amount. -
Okay say kind overcast. know, not particularly bright
solid cloud cover, obviously sun out, not bright. long
think take set clock? - 10 15 sufficient. Stay half
hour. Stay 45 minutes. darker out, stay longer. - Okay
reason, one finds far north, very, dense cloud cover.
long point somebody consider using artificial light source mimic
sunlight? - Yeah, honestly, don't lot information still,
going discuss maybe detail, put
humans artificial conditions, circadian system sensitive light,
reality, real environment, light also affecting aspects independent
setting circadian pacemaker. - Okay. - call direct
effect light mood, example. So, hard figure intensity
need use. haven't done enough experiments 'cause system
discovered just recently. say use bright light morning,
mean, hard give numbers.

00:30:20 Sunlight Simulators, Afternoon Light Viewing, Naps

can get complicated. yeah, mean, honestly, far north
winter make sure don't, use light boxes. suggest
personally, it. - use, actually not designed circadian setting,
930 lux light pad bought bought it, affordable compared
dawn simulating lights. - Yeah, don't need them. - quite expensive,
frankly. - Yeah. - put there. so, just basically, wake morning,
use sun comes out, make sure sun out, go


outside. keep thing day. don't know good bad. good
bad? - I, honestly, don't think exposed bright light day going ever
bad really outside day... Unless, know, worst
going happen temperature high, body's going say don't dehydrate
go sleep. tell actually sometimes hot,
get exposed bright light, sleepier feel afternoon, counter-
intuitive. - Mm hm. protect us, think, dehydration? - think
think human evolution near equator noon certain
time afternoon, hard maintain physiological
homeostatic function, active high temperature time. think napping
way, think major function still... Napping way
somehow take away dangerous zone. maybe people
north say, winter can't wake morning 'cause don't
long light. So, sleep night. summer say, feel like can't
go sleep. put dark curtains. So, think, venturing much
north been... Came problem evolution used certain light
environment completely changed human. animals, think
lived longer, come interesting adaptation actually
measuring even small changes light intensities still occur. so, even
near poles, even though always light, change light
intensity across day-night cycle. So, system, linear, remember told
ipRCGs incredibly linear, can still measure, oh, lower light higher
light organism ability that. - see, yeah, interesting. spent
much time learning fortunately cells, yet never really
appreciated now one hand tracking amount light
understand time relative 24 hour cycle, also keep
mentioning linear measurement intensity; really trying figure
time measuring intensity light. course sun
intense source light available us. So, okay, think nailed
first part day. - Exactly. - Basically get 10 30 minutes depending
bright is, try often possible give system regular source- -
Daily best. system really about, see even effect
depression, multiple days is. don't worry missed one
day,



00:33:48 Jetlagged Home? Chronotypes & Early Risers Succeed

stay longer want. hurry want stuff,
great recommendation. - Mm hm, might want compensate extra
time missed day two. - Absolutely. - heard say before,
entirely possible get severely jet lagged without traveling. - Absolutely. - Simply
staying in, phone much, not getting sunlight. - Absolutely.
saw pandemic. lot people mentioned sleep-wake cycles
suffered lot. not going staying home
don't big windows waking late, waking late, using
bright light late night, body going shift. now, day going
start instead like really sun comes up, say six o'clock
morning, day going start 11 o'clock morning.
body's going think beginning day. So, not going able
sleep 10 o'clock night, now really body, completely
different timing. see happen pandemic high
scale. People get delayed sleep-wake cycle lot. - idea
chronotypes, intrinsically best rhythm either morning
person. - Absolutely. - called early person, night owl,
kind standard bed around 10:30, around 7:00 type thing. think
now good data, correct wrong, National Institutes Mental Health
elsewhere showing deviate intrinsic rhythm, mental
health issues physical health issues start crop up. - So, great data this,
couple things complicate this. first people usually
late, tell society doesn't accommodate. - late,
mean? People wake late go sleep late? - Go sleep late wake
late. overwhelmingly higher level depression failures. mean,
clearly, mean, reason people say sleep early, wake early, better
human notice people go sleep early wake early,
better life. notice that. - just perform better? - perform,
question is, intrinsic system society society start things
usually early late? hard question ask- - discriminate late risers.
- way, discriminate, right? explanation Ken Wright's experiment.


late riser, truly chronotypically late, shift easily
put the... really chronotypically late, phase
relation light-dark environment circadian clock,
camping experiment not caused much changes not light
going affect certain way, relationship body
decided late sleeper, late waking. So, honestly, still unable figure
much late waking controlled light environment much
intrinsic. sure differences, big see
environment? people go off sleep 7:00 p.m. wake
1:00 a.m.. clearly advanced phase- - people go sleep 7:00 p.m.
wake 1:00 a.m.? - Yeah. - feel good that? - not sure feel
good, lot time talk people, say high achievers,
suffer go 7:00 p.m., wake advanced phase sleep syndrome.
call syndrome, people not able sleep till 5:00
a.m., not able wake till 3:00 p.m., right? not sure
circadian system variable human population. mean, clearly
maybe genetic factors make small percentage like everything bell
shape. think time, light environment may play role. once,
talked about, long-term effect light. get rhythm,
don't mean pun, reality, get rhythm, hard break
rhythm start sleeping late waking late, not getting
morning sunlight. - Right. - so, just going late. like
waking early, getting morning sunlight. getting Zeitzer said...
said last name wrong. one Stanford the- - Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah. -
Zeitzer, yeah. - [Andrew] actually worked for- - Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer. So, Zeitzer
Czeisler. - Yeah, confusing.

00:38:33 Decide Best Sleep-Wake Schedule; Minimal Light Test

- Yeah, lot zz's i's names. - Yeah. - phenomenal
scientists. - Yeah. - seems case way really know
meant early bird call it, early person late person,
somewhere get morning sunlight, figure whether not
makes feel better. - understand, educated measure


intensity. "How measure" put quotation 'cause either get measuring device,
cannot depend eye measure intensity. - Okay, that?
'Cause keep coming back this. So, tells important. -
important. - So, obviously, apps, free apps like Light Meter, can
walk around hold button see many lux environment. -
complicated point specific regions. - Right. So,
people start develop intuitive sense measurement intensity? -
Yeah, think one point posted Instagram, keep nighttime home.
found night vision strong. found I, especially
winter, need candle lights. literally use tea lights, put like 15 20
them- - romantic. - nice. see clearly doesn't affect
circadian system. - cats- - wife. - wife course. - just
great, right? don't expect people night vision me. So, mean,
tell people, experiment. put three four lights room, switch two,
sit 15 minutes. - Switch two off? - Switch two off. say using five. see,
15 minutes, will not recognize switched two off. gut feeling
people need least 10 times less light use night see.
problem people use time didn't see morning sunlight.
actually hungry light without knowledge. come switch
lights on, wrong time. woke late. - Okay, now understand.
So, morning light viewing goes way beyond- - Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting
clock. also way determine little light need later day. - Exactly. -
going talk moment, little light get later day
strong determinant things like will wake up, whether not
wake feeling refreshed, et cetera. move- - why, - Yeah? - going
break show, Andrew, going tell you, think something else
people need think about, tripartite model. model
incorporate three components talk details allows us humans
animals incorporate circadian clock, relation light, homeostatic
drive, direct effect environment, includes stress, light, kinds
stuff. incorporated together. think, think right now,
think one alone, will always miss something. think
whole, things really become clear. actually quite amazing. - Okay, well, will
definitely want hear tripartite theory go detail


homeostatic mechanisms. want make sure people thinking now,
sure light impacts them. morning light viewing behavior, like
think tacked clearly. - Absolutely. - thank
much information tried relay information. course,
primary source things circadian, well Jamie others,

00:42:16 Viewing Light Middle Day: Mood & “Light Hunger”

course, Matt Walker. think made very, clear. Now, say
gotten morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe bright artificial light,
throughout day said get lot light. So, working desk. Maybe go
day times, working computer, things.
anything light viewing middle day people keep mind?
can just sort freestyle depending doing? people not
dark room throughout day- - Yeah, gut feeling, got morning
sunlight, walk car slowly walk work, didn't wear sunglasses
lights still dim morning, freestyle it. even
don't get lot light, way just... day, don't just worry
getting lot bright light, personally, like that. go lunch
lunch outside well. reminds body even brighter now.
evidence literally help circadian clock giving lights
dawn dusk. again, think tripartite model, may important
circadian clock, important mood? think need,
homeostatic drive. need think it. So, clock,
entraining clock, literally can entrain dawn sunlight. actually
don't need dawn dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah appreciate
distinguishing circadian effects effects lights. - Yes. -
precise, appreciated. hear tripartite model,
will cover, sake discussion, treat light viewing behavior
benefits drawbacks viewing light biological purposes, not just
circadian settings? So, morning, clearly going set clock. then,
day, understand correctly, idea get much bright light can,
feeding, sounds like sort light hunger. - Exactly. - see. - love
way put it. think weird light hunger considering not


photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.

- Incredible. So, recall 'cause graduate student time, year 2000,
landmark discovery made you, Ignacio Provencio, David Berson,
others, cells exists can communicate day night information
brain. - Yeah. - small subset cells. Since then, heard, maybe
can confirm refute system connects eyes rest brain
actually ancient form vision. probably form vision
early version human beings pattern vision,
see colors shapes motion that. cells
perform role actually similar insect eyes. think heard David Berson say
actually little bit fly eye eye. talking about? -
Yeah. So, really interesting actually, ipRCGs discovered
contribute little bit image formation. now, work Tiffany Schmidt
specifically proven contribute image forming functions.
contribute limited aspect image formation. So, fits hypothesis
ancient photoreceptors. thing adds hypothesis
expressed cells don't modification make look like
photoreceptors. So, photoreceptors told important vision,
image formation, specialized structures allow pack
structures photopigments; photo-detecting proteins,
detect high sensitivity photons pass them. new photoreceptors
don't specialized structures. just really need lot light time,
thought need lot light activated. think
ancient. think adjust ancient functions important
regulating body circadian clock solar environment, solar day light-
dark cycle. - So, mentioned ipRCGs, intrinsically photosensitive. cells
connect eye brain behave like photoreceptors. - Right. - Essentially.
mentioned melanopsin, actual pigment converts light
electrical signal- - Yeah. - less. understanding
melanopsin identified first frog melanophores. - Yes. - mean
like little pieces frog skin eyes? - So, honestly, David Berson say
fly eye sounds better. accurate think
frog skin eye. not catchy, really, name melanopsin
melanocyte opsin, melanopsin found frog melanocytes.


know frogs can change color depending light melanopsin drives
response. Ignacio Provencio first discovered opsins frogs, luckily
smart enough see expressed frog eye. expressed
frog eye appears retinal ganglion cells, told you, one
connects eye brain. insight go see
expressed monkey eye. found also expressed
appears retinal ganglion cells, really opened field wide open.
David Berson seminal experiment went brain
central oscillator, oscillator drives circadian rhythm brain called
suprachiasmatic nucleus, known many years receive retinal input.
labeled cells project there. found even destroy
rods cones, get light responses cells. imagine
nearly fainted saw cells can respond independent, completely
absence rod cone input. - Yeah, never forget reading papers 2000,
2001. meeting DC Ignacio, Iggy, call Iggy, showed
image basically frog melanophores human eye. - Yes. - [Andrew]
everyone like, "oh goodness, thing." - Yeah. - want get
light

00:18:55 Blind People See

actually can control circadian rhythms. moment. - Absolutely. - think worth
mentioning now people pattern vision blind, people cannot see
no conscious vision, eyes, many still cells;
melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive cells, can essentially match entrain,
say, onto light-dark cycle. - fact, possibly no problems circadian
photoentrainment, normal sleep-wake cycle. - totally blind? -
totally image blind. really interesting that, story
heard Chuck Czeisler, give credit, people
image blind, usually get dry eyes give lot pain. doctors used
think, oh, since image blind getting dry eye, don't just
remove eyes? not using anymore. minute remove
eyes, start cyclical sleep problems indicating now not
entraining light-dark cycle cyclical jet lags clock shifts


light-dark cycle. - really interesting. hear number blind
people various aspects job, lot issues sleep. think,
part don't realize

00:20:15 When, & Long View Light Optimal Sleep & Wakefulness

need see light particular times day night order match schedule. -
Absolutely. - Well, think perfect segue us talk light viewing
light can impact sleep-wake rhythms. move
ways light can impact forms bodily function. - Yeah, love way
set one interesting difficult aspect trying educate
people light effect subconscious vision subconscious.
aware think intensity see room, talk people
know take photographs stuff like that, know intensities
varies greatly. system, see way bright
conditions dim conditions, not good estimating intensity
consciously. try tell people intensity, really struggle
think know intensity, really don't. - mean light intensity? - Light
intensity. - Yeah. - cones incredible ability adapt
different light conditions. can see different conditions. Otherwise it'd
disaster. don't change setting camera go inside room
outside, becomes completely white, don't see anything. cones
don't adapt environment, not going able see room
beach, right? problem ipRCGs, cells talked about,
measure intensity pretty well. really know intensity is. good
linear measurement intensity. don't adapt well. don't adapt actually
much, honest. tells subconsciously system used
measuring light intensity natural environment, now
natural environment, don't industrialized lighting, system
functioning well. now change environments, really
mess ourselves. teach people understand intensity.
something explain people. think love myself.
called lowest amount light required allow see comfortably.
fun experiment. - Okay, explain goes.


maybe break day three four parts. say assuming
people wake morning- - Mm hm. - opposed night shift workers, et
cetera, talk later. - Right. - wake morning,
divide day quarters. proper way interact light first part
day? - So, honestly think easiest thing waking up, get much light
can. - eyes? - Yeah, really nice. system prime. entrained,
prime get light, sun out. animals wild, actually seem
track sun. sun huge influence life earth. actually life earth
sun. So, easy. morning wake up, need light. Just
get light. - Okay, behavioral practice recommend? say
somebody condition lot cloud cover. - Yeah. - important
get outside? - So, tell you, cloudiest day going much brighter
room. ask photographer. cloudy day, unless really dark,
dark clouds, usually cloudy days much light outside inside room,
even good lighting inside room. think outside usually
even cloudy, going get enough intensity help adjust
cycle day-night cycle. - So, long you... general rules thumb,
long recommend people go outside? - So, daily, possibly
need few. daily, remember thing going happen
daily matter. So, say 15 minutes. - So, clock tracking regular basis? -
Absolutely. photon counting, tracking. say 15 minutes. don't
daily, may want increase it. talk travel,
do, yeah, 15 minutes fine. more, doesn't hurt. -
window, understanding window, dramatically decreases
amount light energy coming in. - depends thick windows
dark are. So, also nice go outside feel seasons. - Sunglasses
off? - don't use sunglasses. - Yeah, Jordanian photopigment. - Yeah,
yeah, right. - know, so, yeah. Whereas eyes sensitive, right? -
No, personally, shade not incredibly bright, try to, especially
morning, also early person. differentiate early- -
time wake up? - wake 4:30 morning. - sun isn't yet.
- not yet, it's- - So, do? turn artificial lights? - usually
don't turn artificial light know sun going come eventually,
don't like change timing do. - Wait,


4:30 a.m. 7:00 a.m.? - mean, look computer, phone. - Oh,
see. - possibly get enough light, reality, mean long let body
get morning sunlight, think really, no evidence this,
me, look animals, plants, morning sunlight seems
important. don't experiments show it, gut feeling
huge impact humans. - Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab Stanford Sleep Lab
shown early morning light flashes can adjust total amount sleep- -
Absolutely. - one will get. makes easier get sleep. - Absolutely,
absolutely. Ken Wright also beautiful camping experiments showed
that- - Maybe describe 'cause beautiful experiments. - Oh,
yeah, beautiful experiments. took college students late
onset sleep late waking time, said, go camping just don't
use artificial light go sleep late early want,
wake late early. found huge shift sleep pattern just
exposing light-dark cycle. mean, so- - lasted. - lasted,
yeah. - Even came back. - Exactly. - two days camping reset
circadian clock? - Seven days, lasted. Yeah, pretty amazing. Yeah, really
incredible. - Okay, get bright light sort early day, ideally sunlight, even
cloudy day, going be- - Absolutely. - Brighter indoor light. -
easy. - Okay, then- - thing like mention people,
think dim outside, say cloudy, stay longer. remember intensity
one component. Duration also important remember circadian
system not like image system. image system change every
second looking different objects. change perception.
circadian system trying figure day-night cycle?
give information, better are. So, bright,
don't need lot clearly going make fire like crazy. not bright,
stay longer, stay one hour. know, coffee outside something like
that. just going help. - think said something extremely important,
circadian system trying figure time. - Exactly. - Not
space. - Sorry, said, time. - Yeah. - mean are. -
Oh no, no, wasn't correcting you. just meant think fundamentally
incredible thing system. - Absolutely. - clock, 24 hour
clock brain, needs synchronized outside. go little


deeper circadian setting behavior come general rules
thumb? So, say bright day. - Mm hm, mm hm. - Extremely bright. No
clouds, sun's out. said 10 minutes, 15 minutes. - tell
sensitive, don't even go sun. shade. going
many photons shade. going perfect. don't even
see sun. don't sun. know, great vitamin D,
different story. skin protect skin. not
area expertise, effect circadian system, long
outside shade sunny day, 10 15 minutes ample amount. -
Okay say kind overcast. know, not particularly bright
solid cloud cover, obviously sun out, not bright. long
think take set clock? - 10 15 sufficient. Stay half
hour. Stay 45 minutes. darker out, stay longer. - Okay
reason, one finds far north, very, dense cloud cover.
long point somebody consider using artificial light source mimic
sunlight? - Yeah, honestly, don't lot information still,
going discuss maybe detail, put
humans artificial conditions, circadian system sensitive light,
reality, real environment, light also affecting aspects independent
setting circadian pacemaker. - Okay. - call direct
effect light mood, example. So, hard figure intensity
need use. haven't done enough experiments 'cause system
discovered just recently. say use bright light morning,
mean, hard give numbers.

00:30:20 Sunlight Simulators, Afternoon Light Viewing, Naps

can get complicated. yeah, mean, honestly, far north
winter make sure don't, use light boxes. suggest
personally, it. - use, actually not designed circadian setting,
930 lux light pad bought bought it, affordable compared
dawn simulating lights. - Yeah, don't need them. - quite expensive,
frankly. - Yeah. - put there. so, just basically, wake morning,
use sun comes out, make sure sun out, go


outside. keep thing day. don't know good bad. good
bad? - I, honestly, don't think exposed bright light day going ever
bad really outside day... Unless, know, worst
going happen temperature high, body's going say don't dehydrate
go sleep. tell actually sometimes hot,
get exposed bright light, sleepier feel afternoon, counter-
intuitive. - Mm hm. protect us, think, dehydration? - think
think human evolution near equator noon certain
time afternoon, hard maintain physiological
homeostatic function, active high temperature time. think napping
way, think major function still... Napping way
somehow take away dangerous zone. maybe people
north say, winter can't wake morning 'cause don't
long light. So, sleep night. summer say, feel like can't
go sleep. put dark curtains. So, think, venturing much
north been... Came problem evolution used certain light
environment completely changed human. animals, think
lived longer, come interesting adaptation actually
measuring even small changes light intensities still occur. so, even
near poles, even though always light, change light
intensity across day-night cycle. So, system, linear, remember told
ipRCGs incredibly linear, can still measure, oh, lower light higher
light organism ability that. - see, yeah, interesting. spent
much time learning fortunately cells, yet never really
appreciated now one hand tracking amount light
understand time relative 24 hour cycle, also keep
mentioning linear measurement intensity; really trying figure
time measuring intensity light. course sun
intense source light available us. So, okay, think nailed
first part day. - Exactly. - Basically get 10 30 minutes depending
bright is, try often possible give system regular source- -
Daily best. system really about, see even effect
depression, multiple days is. don't worry missed one
day,



00:33:48 Jetlagged Home? Chronotypes & Early Risers Succeed

great recommendation. - Mm hm, might want compensate extra
time missed day two. - Absolutely. - heard say before,
entirely possible get severely jet lagged without traveling. - Absolutely. - Simply
staying in, phone much, not getting sunlight. - Absolutely.
saw pandemic. lot people mentioned sleep-wake cycles
suffered lot. not going staying home
don't big windows waking late, waking late, using
bright light late night, body going shift. now, day going
start instead like really sun comes up, say six o'clock
morning, day going start 11 o'clock morning.
body's going think beginning day. So, not going able
sleep 10 o'clock night, now really body, completely
different timing. see happen pandemic high
scale. People get delayed sleep-wake cycle lot. - idea
chronotypes, intrinsically best rhythm either morning
person. - Absolutely. - called early person, night owl,
kind standard bed around 10:30, around 7:00 type thing. think
now good data, correct wrong, National Institutes Mental Health
elsewhere showing deviate intrinsic rhythm, mental
health issues physical health issues start crop up. - So, great data this,
couple things complicate this. first people usually
late, tell society doesn't accommodate. - late,
mean? People wake late go sleep late? - Go sleep late wake
late. overwhelmingly higher level depression failures. mean,
clearly, mean, reason people say sleep early, wake early, better
human notice people go sleep early wake early,
better life. notice that. - just perform better? - perform,
question is, intrinsic system society society start things
usually early late? hard question ask- - discriminate late risers.
- way, discriminate, right? explanation Ken Wright's experiment.


late riser, truly chronotypically late, shift easily
put the... really chronotypically late, phase
relation light-dark environment circadian clock,
camping experiment not caused much changes not light
going affect certain way, relationship body
decided late sleeper, late waking. So, honestly, still unable figure
much late waking controlled light environment much
intrinsic. sure differences, big see
environment? people go off sleep 7:00 p.m. wake
1:00 a.m.. clearly advanced phase- - people go sleep 7:00 p.m.
wake 1:00 a.m.? - Yeah. - feel good that? - not sure feel
good, lot time talk people, say high achievers,
suffer go 7:00 p.m., wake advanced phase sleep syndrome.
call syndrome, people not able sleep till 5:00
a.m., not able wake till 3:00 p.m., right? not sure
circadian system variable human population. mean, clearly
maybe genetic factors make small percentage like everything bell
shape. think time, light environment may play role. once,
talked about, long-term effect light. get rhythm,
don't mean pun, reality, get rhythm, hard break
rhythm start sleeping late waking late, not getting
morning sunlight. - Right. - so, just going late. like
waking early, getting morning sunlight. getting Zeitzer said...
said last name wrong. one Stanford the- - Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah. -
Zeitzer, yeah. - [Andrew] actually worked for- - Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer. So, Zeitzer
Czeisler. - Yeah, confusing.

00:38:33 Decide Best Sleep-Wake Schedule; Minimal Light Test

- Yeah, lot zz's i's names. - Yeah. - phenomenal
scientists. - Yeah. - seems case way really know
meant early bird call it, early person late person,
somewhere get morning sunlight, figure whether not
makes feel better. - understand, educated measure


intensity. "How measure" put quotation 'cause either get measuring device,
cannot depend eye measure intensity. - Okay, that?
'Cause keep coming back this. So, tells important. -
important. - So, obviously, apps, free apps like Light Meter, can
walk around hold button see many lux environment. -
complicated point specific regions. - Right. So,
people start develop intuitive sense measurement intensity? -
Yeah, think one point posted Instagram, keep nighttime home.
found night vision strong. found I, especially
winter, need candle lights. literally use tea lights, put like 15 20
them- - romantic. - nice. see clearly doesn't affect
circadian system. - cats- - wife. - wife course. - just
great, right? don't expect people night vision me. So, mean,
tell people, experiment. put three four lights room, switch two,
sit 15 minutes. - Switch two off? - Switch two off. say using five. see,
15 minutes, will not recognize switched two off. gut feeling
people need least 10 times less light use night see.
problem people use time didn't see morning sunlight.
actually hungry light without knowledge. come switch
lights on, wrong time. woke late. - Okay, now understand.
So, morning light viewing goes way beyond- - Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting
clock. also way determine little light need later day. - Exactly. -
going talk moment, little light get later day
strong determinant things like will wake up, whether not
wake feeling refreshed, et cetera. move- - why, - Yeah? - going
break show, Andrew, going tell you, think something else
people need think about, tripartite model. model
incorporate three components talk details allows us humans
animals incorporate circadian clock, relation light, homeostatic
drive, direct effect environment, includes stress, light, kinds
stuff. incorporated together. think, think right now,
think one alone, will always miss something. think
whole, things really become clear. actually quite amazing. - Okay, well, will
definitely want hear tripartite theory go detail


homeostatic mechanisms. want make sure people thinking now,
sure light impacts them. morning light viewing behavior, like
think tacked clearly. - Absolutely. - thank
much information tried relay information. course,
primary source things circadian, well Jamie others,

00:42:16 Viewing Light Middle Day: Mood & “Light Hunger”

course, Matt Walker. think made very, clear. Now, say
gotten morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe bright artificial light,
throughout day said get lot light. So, working desk. Maybe go
day times, working computer, things.
anything light viewing middle day people keep mind?
can just sort freestyle depending doing? people not
dark room throughout day- - Yeah, gut feeling, got morning
sunlight, walk car slowly walk work, didn't wear sunglasses
lights still dim morning, freestyle it. even
don't get lot light, way just... day, don't just worry
getting lot bright light, personally, like that. go lunch
lunch outside well. reminds body even brighter now.
evidence literally help circadian clock giving lights
dawn dusk. again, think tripartite model, may important
circadian clock, important mood? think need,
homeostatic drive. need think it. So, clock,
entraining clock, literally can entrain dawn sunlight. actually
don't need dawn dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah appreciate
distinguishing circadian effects effects lights. - Yes. -
precise, appreciated. hear tripartite model,
will cover, sake discussion, treat light viewing behavior
benefits drawbacks viewing light biological purposes, not just
circadian settings? So, morning, clearly going set clock. then,
day, understand correctly, idea get much bright light can,
feeding, sounds like sort light hunger. - Exactly. - see. - love
way put it. think weird light hunger considering not


photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every

know frogs can change color depending light melanopsin drives
response. Ignacio Provencio first discovered opsins frogs, luckily
smart enough see expressed frog eye. expressed
frog eye appears retinal ganglion cells, told you, one
connects eye brain. insight go see
expressed monkey eye. found also expressed
appears retinal ganglion cells, really opened field wide open.
David Berson seminal experiment went brain
central oscillator, oscillator drives circadian rhythm brain called
suprachiasmatic nucleus, known many years receive retinal input.
labeled cells project there. found even destroy
rods cones, get light responses cells. imagine
nearly fainted saw cells can respond independent, completely
absence rod cone input. - Yeah, never forget reading papers 2000,
2001. meeting DC Ignacio, Iggy, call Iggy, showed
image basically frog melanophores human eye. - Yes. - [Andrew]
everyone like, "oh goodness, thing." - Yeah. - want get
light

00:18:55 Blind People See

actually can control circadian rhythms. moment. - Absolutely. - think worth
mentioning now people pattern vision blind, people cannot see
no conscious vision, eyes, many still cells;
melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive cells, can essentially match entrain,
say, onto light-dark cycle. - fact, possibly no problems circadian
photoentrainment, normal sleep-wake cycle. - totally blind? -
totally image blind. really interesting that, story
heard Chuck Czeisler, give credit, people
image blind, usually get dry eyes give lot pain. doctors used
think, oh, since image blind getting dry eye, don't just
remove eyes? not using anymore. minute remove
eyes, start cyclical sleep problems indicating now not
entraining light-dark cycle cyclical jet lags clock shifts


light-dark cycle. - really interesting. hear number blind
people various aspects job, lot issues sleep. think,
part don't realize

00:20:15 When, & Long View Light Optimal Sleep & Wakefulness

need see light particular times day night order match schedule. -
Absolutely. - Well, think perfect segue us talk light viewing
light can impact sleep-wake rhythms. move
ways light can impact forms bodily function. - Yeah, love way
set one interesting difficult aspect trying educate
people light effect subconscious vision subconscious.
aware think intensity see room, talk people
know take photographs stuff like that, know intensities
varies greatly. system, see way bright
conditions dim conditions, not good estimating intensity
consciously. try tell people intensity, really struggle
think know intensity, really don't. - mean light intensity? - Light
intensity. - Yeah. - cones incredible ability adapt
different light conditions. can see different conditions. Otherwise it'd
disaster. don't change setting camera go inside room
outside, becomes completely white, don't see anything. cones
don't adapt environment, not going able see room
beach, right? problem ipRCGs, cells talked about,
measure intensity pretty well. really know intensity is. good
linear measurement intensity. don't adapt well. don't adapt actually
much, honest. tells subconsciously system used
measuring light intensity natural environment, now
natural environment, don't industrialized lighting, system
functioning well. now change environments, really
mess ourselves. teach people understand intensity.
something explain people. think love myself.
called lowest amount light required allow see comfortably.
fun experiment. - Okay, explain goes.


maybe break day three four parts. say assuming
people wake morning- - Mm hm. - opposed night shift workers, et
cetera, talk later. - Right. - wake morning,
divide day quarters. proper way interact light first part
day? - So, honestly think easiest thing waking up, get much light
can. - eyes? - Yeah, really nice. system prime. entrained,
prime get light, sun out. animals wild, actually seem
track sun. sun huge influence life earth. actually life earth
sun. So, easy. morning wake up, need light. Just
get light. - Okay, behavioral practice recommend? say
somebody condition lot cloud cover. - Yeah. - important
get outside? - So, tell you, cloudiest day going much brighter
room. ask photographer. cloudy day, unless really dark,
dark clouds, usually cloudy days much light outside inside room,
even good lighting inside room. think outside usually
even cloudy, going get enough intensity help adjust
cycle day-night cycle. - So, long you... general rules thumb,
long recommend people go outside? - So, daily, possibly
need few. daily, remember thing going happen
daily matter. So, say 15 minutes. - So, clock tracking regular basis? -
Absolutely. photon counting, tracking. say 15 minutes. don't
daily, may want increase it. talk travel,
do, yeah, 15 minutes fine. more, doesn't hurt. -
window, understanding window, dramatically decreases
amount light energy coming in. - depends thick windows
dark are. So, also nice go outside feel seasons. - Sunglasses
off? - don't use sunglasses. - Yeah, Jordanian photopigment. - Yeah,
yeah, right. - know, so, yeah. Whereas eyes sensitive, right? -
No, personally, shade not incredibly bright, try to, especially
morning, also early person. differentiate early- -
time wake up? - wake 4:30 morning. - sun isn't yet.
- not yet, it's- - So, do? turn artificial lights? - usually
don't turn artificial light know sun going come eventually,
don't like change timing do. - Wait,


4:30 a.m. 7:00 a.m.? - mean, look computer, phone. - Oh,
see. - possibly get enough light, reality, mean long let body
get morning sunlight, think really, no evidence this,
me, look animals, plants, morning sunlight seems
important. don't experiments show it, gut feeling
huge impact humans. - Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab Stanford Sleep Lab
shown early morning light flashes can adjust total amount sleep- -
Absolutely. - one will get. makes easier get sleep. - Absolutely,
absolutely. Ken Wright also beautiful camping experiments showed
that- - Maybe describe 'cause beautiful experiments. - Oh,
yeah, beautiful experiments. took college students late
onset sleep late waking time, said, go camping just don't
use artificial light go sleep late early want,
wake late early. found huge shift sleep pattern just
exposing light-dark cycle. mean, so- - lasted. - lasted,
yeah. - Even came back. - Exactly. - two days camping reset
circadian clock? - Seven days, lasted. Yeah, pretty amazing. Yeah, really
incredible. - Okay, get bright light sort early day, ideally sunlight, even
cloudy day, going be- - Absolutely. - Brighter indoor light. -
easy. - Okay, then- - thing like mention people,
think dim outside, say cloudy, stay longer. remember intensity
one component. Duration also important remember circadian
system not like image system. image system change every
second looking different objects. change perception.
circadian system trying figure day-night cycle?
give information, better are. So, bright,
don't need lot clearly going make fire like crazy. not bright,
stay longer, stay one hour. know, coffee outside something like
that. just going help. - think said something extremely important,
circadian system trying figure time. - Exactly. - Not
space. - Sorry, said, time. - Yeah. - mean are. -
Oh no, no, wasn't correcting you. just meant think fundamentally
incredible thing system. - Absolutely. - clock, 24 hour
clock brain, needs synchronized outside. go little


deeper circadian setting behavior come general rules
thumb? So, say bright day. - Mm hm, mm hm. - Extremely bright. No
clouds, sun's out. said 10 minutes, 15 minutes. - tell
sensitive, don't even go sun. shade. going
many photons shade. going perfect. don't even
see sun. don't sun. know, great vitamin D,
different story. skin protect skin. not
area expertise, effect circadian system, long
outside shade sunny day, 10 15 minutes ample amount. -
Okay say kind overcast. know, not particularly bright
solid cloud cover, obviously sun out, not bright. long
think take set clock? - 10 15 sufficient. Stay half
hour. Stay 45 minutes. darker out, stay longer. - Okay
reason, one finds far north, very, dense cloud cover.
long point somebody consider using artificial light source mimic
sunlight? - Yeah, honestly, don't lot information still,
going discuss maybe detail, put
humans artificial conditions, circadian system sensitive light,
reality, real environment, light also affecting aspects independent
setting circadian pacemaker. - Okay. - call direct
effect light mood, example. So, hard figure intensity
need use. haven't done enough experiments 'cause system
discovered just recently. say use bright light morning,
mean, hard give numbers.

00:30:20 Sunlight Simulators, Afternoon Light Viewing, Naps

can get complicated. yeah, mean, honestly, far north
winter make sure don't, use light boxes. suggest
personally, it. - use, actually not designed circadian setting,
930 lux light pad bought bought it, affordable compared
dawn simulating lights. - Yeah, don't need them. - quite expensive,
frankly. - Yeah. - put there. so, just basically, wake morning,
use sun comes out, make sure sun out, go


outside. keep thing day. don't know good bad. good
bad? - I, honestly, don't think exposed bright light day going ever
bad really outside day... Unless, know, worst
going happen temperature high, body's going say don't dehydrate
go sleep. tell actually sometimes hot,
get exposed bright light, sleepier feel afternoon, counter-
intuitive. - Mm hm. protect us, think, dehydration? - think
think human evolution near equator noon certain
time afternoon, hard maintain physiological
homeostatic function, active high temperature time. think napping
way, think major function still... Napping way
somehow take away dangerous zone. maybe people
north say, winter can't wake morning 'cause don't
long light. So, sleep night. summer say, feel like can't
go sleep. put dark curtains. So, think, venturing much
north been... Came problem evolution used certain light
environment completely changed human. animals, think
lived longer, come interesting adaptation actually
measuring even small changes light intensities still occur. so, even
near poles, even though always light, change light
intensity across day-night cycle. So, system, linear, remember told
ipRCGs incredibly linear, can still measure, oh, lower light higher
light organism ability that. - see, yeah, interesting. spent
much time learning fortunately cells, yet never really
appreciated now one hand tracking amount light
understand time relative 24 hour cycle, also keep
mentioning linear measurement intensity; really trying figure
time measuring intensity light. course sun
intense source light available us. So, okay, think nailed
first part day. - Exactly. - Basically get 10 30 minutes depending
bright is, try often possible give system regular source- -
Daily best. system really about, see even effect
depression, multiple days is. don't worry missed one
day,



00:33:48 Jetlagged Home? Chronotypes & Early Risers Succeed

stay longer want. hurry want stuff,
great recommendation. - Mm hm, might want compensate extra
time missed day two. - Absolutely. - heard say before,
entirely possible get severely jet lagged without traveling. - Absolutely. - Simply
staying in, phone much, not getting sunlight. - Absolutely.
saw pandemic. lot people mentioned sleep-wake cycles
suffered lot. not going staying home
don't big windows waking late, waking late, using
bright light late night, body going shift. now, day going
start instead like really sun comes up, say six o'clock
morning, day going start 11 o'clock morning.
body's going think beginning day. So, not going able
sleep 10 o'clock night, now really body, completely
different timing. see happen pandemic high
scale. People get delayed sleep-wake cycle lot. - idea
chronotypes, intrinsically best rhythm either morning
person. - Absolutely. - called early person, night owl,
kind standard bed around 10:30, around 7:00 type thing. think
now good data, correct wrong, National Institutes Mental Health
elsewhere showing deviate intrinsic rhythm, mental
health issues physical health issues start crop up. - So, great data this,
couple things complicate this. first people usually
late, tell society doesn't accommodate. - late,
mean? People wake late go sleep late? - Go sleep late wake
late. overwhelmingly higher level depression failures. mean,
clearly, mean, reason people say sleep early, wake early, better
human notice people go sleep early wake early,
better life. notice that. - just perform better? - perform,
question is, intrinsic system society society start things
usually early late? hard question ask- - discriminate late risers.
- way, discriminate, right? explanation Ken Wright's experiment.


late riser, truly chronotypically late, shift easily
put the... really chronotypically late, phase
relation light-dark environment circadian clock,
camping experiment not caused much changes not light
going affect certain way, relationship body
decided late sleeper, late waking. So, honestly, still unable figure
much late waking controlled light environment much
intrinsic. sure differences, big see
environment? people go off sleep 7:00 p.m. wake
1:00 a.m.. clearly advanced phase- - people go sleep 7:00 p.m.
wake 1:00 a.m.? - Yeah. - feel good that? - not sure feel
good, lot time talk people, say high achievers,
suffer go 7:00 p.m., wake advanced phase sleep syndrome.
call syndrome, people not able sleep till 5:00
a.m., not able wake till 3:00 p.m., right? not sure
circadian system variable human population. mean, clearly
maybe genetic factors make small percentage like everything bell
shape. think time, light environment may play role. once,
talked about, long-term effect light. get rhythm,
don't mean pun, reality, get rhythm, hard break
rhythm start sleeping late waking late, not getting
morning sunlight. - Right. - so, just going late. like
waking early, getting morning sunlight. getting Zeitzer said...
said last name wrong. one Stanford the- - Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah. -
Zeitzer, yeah. - [Andrew] actually worked for- - Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer. So, Zeitzer
Czeisler. - Yeah, confusing.

00:38:33 Decide Best Sleep-Wake Schedule; Minimal Light Test

- Yeah, lot zz's i's names. - Yeah. - phenomenal
scientists. - Yeah. - seems case way really know
meant early bird call it, early person late person,
somewhere get morning sunlight, figure whether not
makes feel better. - understand, educated measure


intensity. "How measure" put quotation 'cause either get measuring device,
cannot depend eye measure intensity. - Okay, that?
'Cause keep coming back this. So, tells important. -
important. - So, obviously, apps, free apps like Light Meter, can
walk around hold button see many lux environment. -
complicated point specific regions. - Right. So,
people start develop intuitive sense measurement intensity? -
Yeah, think one point posted Instagram, keep nighttime home.
found night vision strong. found I, especially
winter, need candle lights. literally use tea lights, put like 15 20
them- - romantic. - nice. see clearly doesn't affect
circadian system. - cats- - wife. - wife course. - just
great, right? don't expect people night vision me. So, mean,
tell people, experiment. put three four lights room, switch two,
sit 15 minutes. - Switch two off? - Switch two off. say using five. see,
15 minutes, will not recognize switched two off. gut feeling
people need least 10 times less light use night see.
problem people use time didn't see morning sunlight.
actually hungry light without knowledge. come switch
lights on, wrong time. woke late. - Okay, now understand.
So, morning light viewing goes way beyond- - Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting
clock. also way determine little light need later day. - Exactly. -
going talk moment, little light get later day
strong determinant things like will wake up, whether not
wake feeling refreshed, et cetera. move- - why, - Yeah? - going
break show, Andrew, going tell you, think something else
people need think about, tripartite model. model
incorporate three components talk details allows us humans
animals incorporate circadian clock, relation light, homeostatic
drive, direct effect environment, includes stress, light, kinds
stuff. incorporated together. think, think right now,
think one alone, will always miss something. think
whole, things really become clear. actually quite amazing. - Okay, well, will
definitely want hear tripartite theory go detail


homeostatic mechanisms. want make sure people thinking now,
sure light impacts them. morning light viewing behavior, like
think tacked clearly. - Absolutely. - thank
much information tried relay information. course,
primary source things circadian, well Jamie others,

00:42:16 Viewing Light Middle Day: Mood & “Light Hunger”

course, Matt Walker. think made very, clear. Now, say
gotten morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe bright artificial light,
throughout day said get lot light. So, working desk. Maybe go
day times, working computer, things.
anything light viewing middle day people keep mind?
can just sort freestyle depending doing? people not
dark room throughout day- - Yeah, gut feeling, got morning
sunlight, walk car slowly walk work, didn't wear sunglasses
lights still dim morning, freestyle it. even
don't get lot light, way just... day, don't just worry
getting lot bright light, personally, like that. go lunch
lunch outside well. reminds body even brighter now.
evidence literally help circadian clock giving lights
dawn dusk. again, think tripartite model, may important
circadian clock, important mood? think need,
homeostatic drive. need think it. So, clock,
entraining clock, literally can entrain dawn sunlight. actually
don't need dawn dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah appreciate
distinguishing circadian effects effects lights. - Yes. -
precise, appreciated. hear tripartite model,
will cover, sake discussion, treat light viewing behavior
benefits drawbacks viewing light biological purposes, not just
circadian settings? So, morning, clearly going set clock. then,
day, understand correctly, idea get much bright light can,
feeding, sounds like sort light hunger. - Exactly. - see. - love
way put it. think weird light hunger considering not


photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.

Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also

light-dark cycle. - really interesting. hear number blind
people various aspects job, lot issues sleep. think,
part don't realize

00:20:15 When, & Long View Light Optimal Sleep & Wakefulness

need see light particular times day night order match schedule. -
Absolutely. - Well, think perfect segue us talk light viewing
light can impact sleep-wake rhythms. move
ways light can impact forms bodily function. - Yeah, love way
set one interesting difficult aspect trying educate
people light effect subconscious vision subconscious.
aware think intensity see room, talk people
know take photographs stuff like that, know intensities
varies greatly. system, see way bright
conditions dim conditions, not good estimating intensity
consciously. try tell people intensity, really struggle
think know intensity, really don't. - mean light intensity? - Light
intensity. - Yeah. - cones incredible ability adapt
different light conditions. can see different conditions. Otherwise it'd
disaster. don't change setting camera go inside room
outside, becomes completely white, don't see anything. cones
don't adapt environment, not going able see room
beach, right? problem ipRCGs, cells talked about,
measure intensity pretty well. really know intensity is. good
linear measurement intensity. don't adapt well. don't adapt actually
much, honest. tells subconsciously system used
measuring light intensity natural environment, now
natural environment, don't industrialized lighting, system
functioning well. now change environments, really
mess ourselves. teach people understand intensity.
something explain people. think love myself.
called lowest amount light required allow see comfortably.
fun experiment. - Okay, explain goes.


maybe break day three four parts. say assuming
people wake morning- - Mm hm. - opposed night shift workers, et
cetera, talk later. - Right. - wake morning,
divide day quarters. proper way interact light first part
day? - So, honestly think easiest thing waking up, get much light
can. - eyes? - Yeah, really nice. system prime. entrained,
prime get light, sun out. animals wild, actually seem
track sun. sun huge influence life earth. actually life earth
sun. So, easy. morning wake up, need light. Just
get light. - Okay, behavioral practice recommend? say
somebody condition lot cloud cover. - Yeah. - important
get outside? - So, tell you, cloudiest day going much brighter
room. ask photographer. cloudy day, unless really dark,
dark clouds, usually cloudy days much light outside inside room,
even good lighting inside room. think outside usually
even cloudy, going get enough intensity help adjust
cycle day-night cycle. - So, long you... general rules thumb,
long recommend people go outside? - So, daily, possibly
need few. daily, remember thing going happen
daily matter. So, say 15 minutes. - So, clock tracking regular basis? -
Absolutely. photon counting, tracking. say 15 minutes. don't
daily, may want increase it. talk travel,
do, yeah, 15 minutes fine. more, doesn't hurt. -
window, understanding window, dramatically decreases
amount light energy coming in. - depends thick windows
dark are. So, also nice go outside feel seasons. - Sunglasses
off? - don't use sunglasses. - Yeah, Jordanian photopigment. - Yeah,
yeah, right. - know, so, yeah. Whereas eyes sensitive, right? -
No, personally, shade not incredibly bright, try to, especially
morning, also early person. differentiate early- -
time wake up? - wake 4:30 morning. - sun isn't yet.
- not yet, it's- - So, do? turn artificial lights? - usually
don't turn artificial light know sun going come eventually,
don't like change timing do. - Wait,


4:30 a.m. 7:00 a.m.? - mean, look computer, phone. - Oh,
see. - possibly get enough light, reality, mean long let body
get morning sunlight, think really, no evidence this,
me, look animals, plants, morning sunlight seems
important. don't experiments show it, gut feeling
huge impact humans. - Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab Stanford Sleep Lab
shown early morning light flashes can adjust total amount sleep- -
Absolutely. - one will get. makes easier get sleep. - Absolutely,
absolutely. Ken Wright also beautiful camping experiments showed
that- - Maybe describe 'cause beautiful experiments. - Oh,
yeah, beautiful experiments. took college students late
onset sleep late waking time, said, go camping just don't
use artificial light go sleep late early want,
wake late early. found huge shift sleep pattern just
exposing light-dark cycle. mean, so- - lasted. - lasted,
yeah. - Even came back. - Exactly. - two days camping reset
circadian clock? - Seven days, lasted. Yeah, pretty amazing. Yeah, really
incredible. - Okay, get bright light sort early day, ideally sunlight, even
cloudy day, going be- - Absolutely. - Brighter indoor light. -
easy. - Okay, then- - thing like mention people,
think dim outside, say cloudy, stay longer. remember intensity
one component. Duration also important remember circadian
system not like image system. image system change every
second looking different objects. change perception.
circadian system trying figure day-night cycle?
give information, better are. So, bright,
don't need lot clearly going make fire like crazy. not bright,
stay longer, stay one hour. know, coffee outside something like
that. just going help. - think said something extremely important,
circadian system trying figure time. - Exactly. - Not
space. - Sorry, said, time. - Yeah. - mean are. -
Oh no, no, wasn't correcting you. just meant think fundamentally
incredible thing system. - Absolutely. - clock, 24 hour
clock brain, needs synchronized outside. go little


deeper circadian setting behavior come general rules
thumb? So, say bright day. - Mm hm, mm hm. - Extremely bright. No
clouds, sun's out. said 10 minutes, 15 minutes. - tell
sensitive, don't even go sun. shade. going
many photons shade. going perfect. don't even
see sun. don't sun. know, great vitamin D,
different story. skin protect skin. not
area expertise, effect circadian system, long
outside shade sunny day, 10 15 minutes ample amount. -
Okay say kind overcast. know, not particularly bright
solid cloud cover, obviously sun out, not bright. long
think take set clock? - 10 15 sufficient. Stay half
hour. Stay 45 minutes. darker out, stay longer. - Okay
reason, one finds far north, very, dense cloud cover.
long point somebody consider using artificial light source mimic
sunlight? - Yeah, honestly, don't lot information still,
going discuss maybe detail, put
humans artificial conditions, circadian system sensitive light,
reality, real environment, light also affecting aspects independent
setting circadian pacemaker. - Okay. - call direct
effect light mood, example. So, hard figure intensity
need use. haven't done enough experiments 'cause system
discovered just recently. say use bright light morning,
mean, hard give numbers.

00:30:20 Sunlight Simulators, Afternoon Light Viewing, Naps

can get complicated. yeah, mean, honestly, far north
winter make sure don't, use light boxes. suggest
personally, it. - use, actually not designed circadian setting,
930 lux light pad bought bought it, affordable compared
dawn simulating lights. - Yeah, don't need them. - quite expensive,
frankly. - Yeah. - put there. so, just basically, wake morning,
use sun comes out, make sure sun out, go


outside. keep thing day. don't know good bad. good
bad? - I, honestly, don't think exposed bright light day going ever
bad really outside day... Unless, know, worst
going happen temperature high, body's going say don't dehydrate
go sleep. tell actually sometimes hot,
get exposed bright light, sleepier feel afternoon, counter-
intuitive. - Mm hm. protect us, think, dehydration? - think
think human evolution near equator noon certain
time afternoon, hard maintain physiological
homeostatic function, active high temperature time. think napping
way, think major function still... Napping way
somehow take away dangerous zone. maybe people
north say, winter can't wake morning 'cause don't
long light. So, sleep night. summer say, feel like can't
go sleep. put dark curtains. So, think, venturing much
north been... Came problem evolution used certain light
environment completely changed human. animals, think
lived longer, come interesting adaptation actually
measuring even small changes light intensities still occur. so, even
near poles, even though always light, change light
intensity across day-night cycle. So, system, linear, remember told
ipRCGs incredibly linear, can still measure, oh, lower light higher
light organism ability that. - see, yeah, interesting. spent
much time learning fortunately cells, yet never really
appreciated now one hand tracking amount light
understand time relative 24 hour cycle, also keep
mentioning linear measurement intensity; really trying figure
time measuring intensity light. course sun
intense source light available us. So, okay, think nailed
first part day. - Exactly. - Basically get 10 30 minutes depending
bright is, try often possible give system regular source- -
Daily best. system really about, see even effect
depression, multiple days is. don't worry missed one
day,



00:33:48 Jetlagged Home? Chronotypes & Early Risers Succeed

stay longer want. hurry want stuff,
great recommendation. - Mm hm, might want compensate extra
time missed day two. - Absolutely. - heard say before,
entirely possible get severely jet lagged without traveling. - Absolutely. - Simply
staying in, phone much, not getting sunlight. - Absolutely.
saw pandemic. lot people mentioned sleep-wake cycles
suffered lot. not going staying home
don't big windows waking late, waking late, using
bright light late night, body going shift. now, day going
start instead like really sun comes up, say six o'clock
morning, day going start 11 o'clock morning.
body's going think beginning day. So, not going able
sleep 10 o'clock night, now really body, completely
different timing. see happen pandemic high
scale. People get delayed sleep-wake cycle lot. - idea
chronotypes, intrinsically best rhythm either morning
person. - Absolutely. - called early person, night owl,
kind standard bed around 10:30, around 7:00 type thing. think
now good data, correct wrong, National Institutes Mental Health
elsewhere showing deviate intrinsic rhythm, mental
health issues physical health issues start crop up. - So, great data this,
couple things complicate this. first people usually
late, tell society doesn't accommodate. - late,
mean? People wake late go sleep late? - Go sleep late wake
late. overwhelmingly higher level depression failures. mean,
clearly, mean, reason people say sleep early, wake early, better
human notice people go sleep early wake early,
better life. notice that. - just perform better? - perform,
question is, intrinsic system society society start things
usually early late? hard question ask- - discriminate late risers.
- way, discriminate, right? explanation Ken Wright's experiment.


late riser, truly chronotypically late, shift easily
put the... really chronotypically late, phase
relation light-dark environment circadian clock,
camping experiment not caused much changes not light
going affect certain way, relationship body
decided late sleeper, late waking. So, honestly, still unable figure
much late waking controlled light environment much
intrinsic. sure differences, big see
environment? people go off sleep 7:00 p.m. wake
1:00 a.m.. clearly advanced phase- - people go sleep 7:00 p.m.
wake 1:00 a.m.? - Yeah. - feel good that? - not sure feel
good, lot time talk people, say high achievers,
suffer go 7:00 p.m., wake advanced phase sleep syndrome.
call syndrome, people not able sleep till 5:00
a.m., not able wake till 3:00 p.m., right? not sure
circadian system variable human population. mean, clearly
maybe genetic factors make small percentage like everything bell
shape. think time, light environment may play role. once,
talked about, long-term effect light. get rhythm,
don't mean pun, reality, get rhythm, hard break
rhythm start sleeping late waking late, not getting
morning sunlight. - Right. - so, just going late. like
waking early, getting morning sunlight. getting Zeitzer said...
said last name wrong. one Stanford the- - Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah. -
Zeitzer, yeah. - [Andrew] actually worked for- - Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer. So, Zeitzer
Czeisler. - Yeah, confusing.

00:38:33 Decide Best Sleep-Wake Schedule; Minimal Light Test

- Yeah, lot zz's i's names. - Yeah. - phenomenal
scientists. - Yeah. - seems case way really know
meant early bird call it, early person late person,
somewhere get morning sunlight, figure whether not
makes feel better. - understand, educated measure


intensity. "How measure" put quotation 'cause either get measuring device,
cannot depend eye measure intensity. - Okay, that?
'Cause keep coming back this. So, tells important. -
important. - So, obviously, apps, free apps like Light Meter, can
walk around hold button see many lux environment. -
complicated point specific regions. - Right. So,
people start develop intuitive sense measurement intensity? -
Yeah, think one point posted Instagram, keep nighttime home.
found night vision strong. found I, especially
winter, need candle lights. literally use tea lights, put like 15 20
them- - romantic. - nice. see clearly doesn't affect
circadian system. - cats- - wife. - wife course. - just
great, right? don't expect people night vision me. So, mean,
tell people, experiment. put three four lights room, switch two,
sit 15 minutes. - Switch two off? - Switch two off. say using five. see,
15 minutes, will not recognize switched two off. gut feeling
people need least 10 times less light use night see.
problem people use time didn't see morning sunlight.
actually hungry light without knowledge. come switch
lights on, wrong time. woke late. - Okay, now understand.
So, morning light viewing goes way beyond- - Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting
clock. also way determine little light need later day. - Exactly. -
going talk moment, little light get later day
strong determinant things like will wake up, whether not
wake feeling refreshed, et cetera. move- - why, - Yeah? - going
break show, Andrew, going tell you, think something else
people need think about, tripartite model. model
incorporate three components talk details allows us humans
animals incorporate circadian clock, relation light, homeostatic
drive, direct effect environment, includes stress, light, kinds
stuff. incorporated together. think, think right now,
think one alone, will always miss something. think
whole, things really become clear. actually quite amazing. - Okay, well, will
definitely want hear tripartite theory go detail


homeostatic mechanisms. want make sure people thinking now,
sure light impacts them. morning light viewing behavior, like
think tacked clearly. - Absolutely. - thank
much information tried relay information. course,
primary source things circadian, well Jamie others,

00:42:16 Viewing Light Middle Day: Mood & “Light Hunger”

course, Matt Walker. think made very, clear. Now, say
gotten morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe bright artificial light,
throughout day said get lot light. So, working desk. Maybe go
day times, working computer, things.
anything light viewing middle day people keep mind?
can just sort freestyle depending doing? people not
dark room throughout day- - Yeah, gut feeling, got morning
sunlight, walk car slowly walk work, didn't wear sunglasses
lights still dim morning, freestyle it. even
don't get lot light, way just... day, don't just worry
getting lot bright light, personally, like that. go lunch
lunch outside well. reminds body even brighter now.
evidence literally help circadian clock giving lights
dawn dusk. again, think tripartite model, may important
circadian clock, important mood? think need,
homeostatic drive. need think it. So, clock,
entraining clock, literally can entrain dawn sunlight. actually
don't need dawn dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah appreciate
distinguishing circadian effects effects lights. - Yes. -
precise, appreciated. hear tripartite model,
will cover, sake discussion, treat light viewing behavior
benefits drawbacks viewing light biological purposes, not just
circadian settings? So, morning, clearly going set clock. then,
day, understand correctly, idea get much bright light can,
feeding, sounds like sort light hunger. - Exactly. - see. - love
way put it. think weird light hunger considering not


photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

maybe break day three four parts. say assuming
people wake morning- - Mm hm. - opposed night shift workers, et
cetera, talk later. - Right. - wake morning,
divide day quarters. proper way interact light first part
day? - So, honestly think easiest thing waking up, get much light
can. - eyes? - Yeah, really nice. system prime. entrained,
prime get light, sun out. animals wild, actually seem
track sun. sun huge influence life earth. actually life earth
sun. So, easy. morning wake up, need light. Just
get light. - Okay, behavioral practice recommend? say
somebody condition lot cloud cover. - Yeah. - important
get outside? - So, tell you, cloudiest day going much brighter
room. ask photographer. cloudy day, unless really dark,
dark clouds, usually cloudy days much light outside inside room,
even good lighting inside room. think outside usually
even cloudy, going get enough intensity help adjust
cycle day-night cycle. - So, long you... general rules thumb,
long recommend people go outside? - So, daily, possibly
need few. daily, remember thing going happen
daily matter. So, say 15 minutes. - So, clock tracking regular basis? -
Absolutely. photon counting, tracking. say 15 minutes. don't
daily, may want increase it. talk travel,
do, yeah, 15 minutes fine. more, doesn't hurt. -
window, understanding window, dramatically decreases
amount light energy coming in. - depends thick windows
dark are. So, also nice go outside feel seasons. - Sunglasses
off? - don't use sunglasses. - Yeah, Jordanian photopigment. - Yeah,
yeah, right. - know, so, yeah. Whereas eyes sensitive, right? -
No, personally, shade not incredibly bright, try to, especially
morning, also early person. differentiate early- -
time wake up? - wake 4:30 morning. - sun isn't yet.
- not yet, it's- - So, do? turn artificial lights? - usually
don't turn artificial light know sun going come eventually,
don't like change timing do. - Wait,


4:30 a.m. 7:00 a.m.? - mean, look computer, phone. - Oh,
see. - possibly get enough light, reality, mean long let body
get morning sunlight, think really, no evidence this,
me, look animals, plants, morning sunlight seems
important. don't experiments show it, gut feeling
huge impact humans. - Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab Stanford Sleep Lab
shown early morning light flashes can adjust total amount sleep- -
Absolutely. - one will get. makes easier get sleep. - Absolutely,
absolutely. Ken Wright also beautiful camping experiments showed
that- - Maybe describe 'cause beautiful experiments. - Oh,
yeah, beautiful experiments. took college students late
onset sleep late waking time, said, go camping just don't
use artificial light go sleep late early want,
wake late early. found huge shift sleep pattern just
exposing light-dark cycle. mean, so- - lasted. - lasted,
yeah. - Even came back. - Exactly. - two days camping reset
circadian clock? - Seven days, lasted. Yeah, pretty amazing. Yeah, really
incredible. - Okay, get bright light sort early day, ideally sunlight, even
cloudy day, going be- - Absolutely. - Brighter indoor light. -
easy. - Okay, then- - thing like mention people,
think dim outside, say cloudy, stay longer. remember intensity
one component. Duration also important remember circadian
system not like image system. image system change every
second looking different objects. change perception.
circadian system trying figure day-night cycle?
give information, better are. So, bright,
don't need lot clearly going make fire like crazy. not bright,
stay longer, stay one hour. know, coffee outside something like
that. just going help. - think said something extremely important,
circadian system trying figure time. - Exactly. - Not
space. - Sorry, said, time. - Yeah. - mean are. -
Oh no, no, wasn't correcting you. just meant think fundamentally
incredible thing system. - Absolutely. - clock, 24 hour
clock brain, needs synchronized outside. go little


deeper circadian setting behavior come general rules
thumb? So, say bright day. - Mm hm, mm hm. - Extremely bright. No
clouds, sun's out. said 10 minutes, 15 minutes. - tell
sensitive, don't even go sun. shade. going
many photons shade. going perfect. don't even
see sun. don't sun. know, great vitamin D,
different story. skin protect skin. not
area expertise, effect circadian system, long
outside shade sunny day, 10 15 minutes ample amount. -
Okay say kind overcast. know, not particularly bright
solid cloud cover, obviously sun out, not bright. long
think take set clock? - 10 15 sufficient. Stay half
hour. Stay 45 minutes. darker out, stay longer. - Okay
reason, one finds far north, very, dense cloud cover.
long point somebody consider using artificial light source mimic
sunlight? - Yeah, honestly, don't lot information still,
going discuss maybe detail, put
humans artificial conditions, circadian system sensitive light,
reality, real environment, light also affecting aspects independent
setting circadian pacemaker. - Okay. - call direct
effect light mood, example. So, hard figure intensity
need use. haven't done enough experiments 'cause system
discovered just recently. say use bright light morning,
mean, hard give numbers.

00:30:20 Sunlight Simulators, Afternoon Light Viewing, Naps

can get complicated. yeah, mean, honestly, far north
winter make sure don't, use light boxes. suggest
personally, it. - use, actually not designed circadian setting,
930 lux light pad bought bought it, affordable compared
dawn simulating lights. - Yeah, don't need them. - quite expensive,
frankly. - Yeah. - put there. so, just basically, wake morning,
use sun comes out, make sure sun out, go


outside. keep thing day. don't know good bad. good
bad? - I, honestly, don't think exposed bright light day going ever
bad really outside day... Unless, know, worst
going happen temperature high, body's going say don't dehydrate
go sleep. tell actually sometimes hot,
get exposed bright light, sleepier feel afternoon, counter-
intuitive. - Mm hm. protect us, think, dehydration? - think
think human evolution near equator noon certain
time afternoon, hard maintain physiological
homeostatic function, active high temperature time. think napping
way, think major function still... Napping way
somehow take away dangerous zone. maybe people
north say, winter can't wake morning 'cause don't
long light. So, sleep night. summer say, feel like can't
go sleep. put dark curtains. So, think, venturing much
north been... Came problem evolution used certain light
environment completely changed human. animals, think
lived longer, come interesting adaptation actually
measuring even small changes light intensities still occur. so, even
near poles, even though always light, change light
intensity across day-night cycle. So, system, linear, remember told
ipRCGs incredibly linear, can still measure, oh, lower light higher
light organism ability that. - see, yeah, interesting. spent
much time learning fortunately cells, yet never really
appreciated now one hand tracking amount light
understand time relative 24 hour cycle, also keep
mentioning linear measurement intensity; really trying figure
time measuring intensity light. course sun
intense source light available us. So, okay, think nailed
first part day. - Exactly. - Basically get 10 30 minutes depending
bright is, try often possible give system regular source- -
Daily best. system really about, see even effect
depression, multiple days is. don't worry missed one
day,



00:33:48 Jetlagged Home? Chronotypes & Early Risers Succeed

stay longer want. hurry want stuff,
great recommendation. - Mm hm, might want compensate extra
time missed day two. - Absolutely. - heard say before,
entirely possible get severely jet lagged without traveling. - Absolutely. - Simply
staying in, phone much, not getting sunlight. - Absolutely.
saw pandemic. lot people mentioned sleep-wake cycles
suffered lot. not going staying home
don't big windows waking late, waking late, using
bright light late night, body going shift. now, day going
start instead like really sun comes up, say six o'clock
morning, day going start 11 o'clock morning.
body's going think beginning day. So, not going able
sleep 10 o'clock night, now really body, completely
different timing. see happen pandemic high
scale. People get delayed sleep-wake cycle lot. - idea
chronotypes, intrinsically best rhythm either morning
person. - Absolutely. - called early person, night owl,
kind standard bed around 10:30, around 7:00 type thing. think
now good data, correct wrong, National Institutes Mental Health
elsewhere showing deviate intrinsic rhythm, mental
health issues physical health issues start crop up. - So, great data this,
couple things complicate this. first people usually
late, tell society doesn't accommodate. - late,
mean? People wake late go sleep late? - Go sleep late wake
late. overwhelmingly higher level depression failures. mean,
clearly, mean, reason people say sleep early, wake early, better
human notice people go sleep early wake early,
better life. notice that. - just perform better? - perform,
question is, intrinsic system society society start things
usually early late? hard question ask- - discriminate late risers.
- way, discriminate, right? explanation Ken Wright's experiment.


late riser, truly chronotypically late, shift easily
put the... really chronotypically late, phase
relation light-dark environment circadian clock,
camping experiment not caused much changes not light
going affect certain way, relationship body
decided late sleeper, late waking. So, honestly, still unable figure
much late waking controlled light environment much
intrinsic. sure differences, big see
environment? people go off sleep 7:00 p.m. wake
1:00 a.m.. clearly advanced phase- - people go sleep 7:00 p.m.
wake 1:00 a.m.? - Yeah. - feel good that? - not sure feel
good, lot time talk people, say high achievers,
suffer go 7:00 p.m., wake advanced phase sleep syndrome.
call syndrome, people not able sleep till 5:00
a.m., not able wake till 3:00 p.m., right? not sure
circadian system variable human population. mean, clearly
maybe genetic factors make small percentage like everything bell
shape. think time, light environment may play role. once,
talked about, long-term effect light. get rhythm,
don't mean pun, reality, get rhythm, hard break
rhythm start sleeping late waking late, not getting
morning sunlight. - Right. - so, just going late. like
waking early, getting morning sunlight. getting Zeitzer said...
said last name wrong. one Stanford the- - Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah. -
Zeitzer, yeah. - [Andrew] actually worked for- - Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer. So, Zeitzer
Czeisler. - Yeah, confusing.

00:38:33 Decide Best Sleep-Wake Schedule; Minimal Light Test

- Yeah, lot zz's i's names. - Yeah. - phenomenal
scientists. - Yeah. - seems case way really know
meant early bird call it, early person late person,
somewhere get morning sunlight, figure whether not
makes feel better. - understand, educated measure


intensity. "How measure" put quotation 'cause either get measuring device,
cannot depend eye measure intensity. - Okay, that?
'Cause keep coming back this. So, tells important. -
important. - So, obviously, apps, free apps like Light Meter, can
walk around hold button see many lux environment. -
complicated point specific regions. - Right. So,
people start develop intuitive sense measurement intensity? -
Yeah, think one point posted Instagram, keep nighttime home.
found night vision strong. found I, especially
winter, need candle lights. literally use tea lights, put like 15 20
them- - romantic. - nice. see clearly doesn't affect
circadian system. - cats- - wife. - wife course. - just
great, right? don't expect people night vision me. So, mean,
tell people, experiment. put three four lights room, switch two,
sit 15 minutes. - Switch two off? - Switch two off. say using five. see,
15 minutes, will not recognize switched two off. gut feeling
people need least 10 times less light use night see.
problem people use time didn't see morning sunlight.
actually hungry light without knowledge. come switch
lights on, wrong time. woke late. - Okay, now understand.
So, morning light viewing goes way beyond- - Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting
clock. also way determine little light need later day. - Exactly. -
going talk moment, little light get later day
strong determinant things like will wake up, whether not
wake feeling refreshed, et cetera. move- - why, - Yeah? - going
break show, Andrew, going tell you, think something else
people need think about, tripartite model. model
incorporate three components talk details allows us humans
animals incorporate circadian clock, relation light, homeostatic
drive, direct effect environment, includes stress, light, kinds
stuff. incorporated together. think, think right now,
think one alone, will always miss something. think
whole, things really become clear. actually quite amazing. - Okay, well, will
definitely want hear tripartite theory go detail


homeostatic mechanisms. want make sure people thinking now,
sure light impacts them. morning light viewing behavior, like
think tacked clearly. - Absolutely. - thank
much information tried relay information. course,
primary source things circadian, well Jamie others,

00:42:16 Viewing Light Middle Day: Mood & “Light Hunger”

course, Matt Walker. think made very, clear. Now, say
gotten morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe bright artificial light,
throughout day said get lot light. So, working desk. Maybe go
day times, working computer, things.
anything light viewing middle day people keep mind?
can just sort freestyle depending doing? people not
dark room throughout day- - Yeah, gut feeling, got morning
sunlight, walk car slowly walk work, didn't wear sunglasses
lights still dim morning, freestyle it. even
don't get lot light, way just... day, don't just worry
getting lot bright light, personally, like that. go lunch
lunch outside well. reminds body even brighter now.
evidence literally help circadian clock giving lights
dawn dusk. again, think tripartite model, may important
circadian clock, important mood? think need,
homeostatic drive. need think it. So, clock,
entraining clock, literally can entrain dawn sunlight. actually
don't need dawn dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah appreciate
distinguishing circadian effects effects lights. - Yes. -
precise, appreciated. hear tripartite model,
will cover, sake discussion, treat light viewing behavior
benefits drawbacks viewing light biological purposes, not just
circadian settings? So, morning, clearly going set clock. then,
day, understand correctly, idea get much bright light can,
feeding, sounds like sort light hunger. - Exactly. - see. - love
way put it. think weird light hunger considering not


photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.

4:30 a.m. 7:00 a.m.? - mean, look computer, phone. - Oh,
see. - possibly get enough light, reality, mean long let body
get morning sunlight, think really, no evidence this,
me, look animals, plants, morning sunlight seems
important. don't experiments show it, gut feeling
huge impact humans. - Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab Stanford Sleep Lab
shown early morning light flashes can adjust total amount sleep- -
Absolutely. - one will get. makes easier get sleep. - Absolutely,
absolutely. Ken Wright also beautiful camping experiments showed
that- - Maybe describe 'cause beautiful experiments. - Oh,
yeah, beautiful experiments. took college students late
onset sleep late waking time, said, go camping just don't
use artificial light go sleep late early want,
wake late early. found huge shift sleep pattern just
exposing light-dark cycle. mean, so- - lasted. - lasted,
yeah. - Even came back. - Exactly. - two days camping reset
circadian clock? - Seven days, lasted. Yeah, pretty amazing. Yeah, really
incredible. - Okay, get bright light sort early day, ideally sunlight, even
cloudy day, going be- - Absolutely. - Brighter indoor light. -
easy. - Okay, then- - thing like mention people,
think dim outside, say cloudy, stay longer. remember intensity
one component. Duration also important remember circadian
system not like image system. image system change every
second looking different objects. change perception.
circadian system trying figure day-night cycle?
give information, better are. So, bright,
don't need lot clearly going make fire like crazy. not bright,
stay longer, stay one hour. know, coffee outside something like
that. just going help. - think said something extremely important,
circadian system trying figure time. - Exactly. - Not
space. - Sorry, said, time. - Yeah. - mean are. -
Oh no, no, wasn't correcting you. just meant think fundamentally
incredible thing system. - Absolutely. - clock, 24 hour
clock brain, needs synchronized outside. go little


deeper circadian setting behavior come general rules
thumb? So, say bright day. - Mm hm, mm hm. - Extremely bright. No
clouds, sun's out. said 10 minutes, 15 minutes. - tell
sensitive, don't even go sun. shade. going
many photons shade. going perfect. don't even
see sun. don't sun. know, great vitamin D,
different story. skin protect skin. not
area expertise, effect circadian system, long
outside shade sunny day, 10 15 minutes ample amount. -
Okay say kind overcast. know, not particularly bright
solid cloud cover, obviously sun out, not bright. long
think take set clock? - 10 15 sufficient. Stay half
hour. Stay 45 minutes. darker out, stay longer. - Okay
reason, one finds far north, very, dense cloud cover.
long point somebody consider using artificial light source mimic
sunlight? - Yeah, honestly, don't lot information still,
going discuss maybe detail, put
humans artificial conditions, circadian system sensitive light,
reality, real environment, light also affecting aspects independent
setting circadian pacemaker. - Okay. - call direct
effect light mood, example. So, hard figure intensity
need use. haven't done enough experiments 'cause system
discovered just recently. say use bright light morning,
mean, hard give numbers.

00:30:20 Sunlight Simulators, Afternoon Light Viewing, Naps

can get complicated. yeah, mean, honestly, far north
winter make sure don't, use light boxes. suggest
personally, it. - use, actually not designed circadian setting,
930 lux light pad bought bought it, affordable compared
dawn simulating lights. - Yeah, don't need them. - quite expensive,
frankly. - Yeah. - put there. so, just basically, wake morning,
use sun comes out, make sure sun out, go


outside. keep thing day. don't know good bad. good
bad? - I, honestly, don't think exposed bright light day going ever
bad really outside day... Unless, know, worst
going happen temperature high, body's going say don't dehydrate
go sleep. tell actually sometimes hot,
get exposed bright light, sleepier feel afternoon, counter-
intuitive. - Mm hm. protect us, think, dehydration? - think
think human evolution near equator noon certain
time afternoon, hard maintain physiological
homeostatic function, active high temperature time. think napping
way, think major function still... Napping way
somehow take away dangerous zone. maybe people
north say, winter can't wake morning 'cause don't
long light. So, sleep night. summer say, feel like can't
go sleep. put dark curtains. So, think, venturing much
north been... Came problem evolution used certain light
environment completely changed human. animals, think
lived longer, come interesting adaptation actually
measuring even small changes light intensities still occur. so, even
near poles, even though always light, change light
intensity across day-night cycle. So, system, linear, remember told
ipRCGs incredibly linear, can still measure, oh, lower light higher
light organism ability that. - see, yeah, interesting. spent
much time learning fortunately cells, yet never really
appreciated now one hand tracking amount light
understand time relative 24 hour cycle, also keep
mentioning linear measurement intensity; really trying figure
time measuring intensity light. course sun
intense source light available us. So, okay, think nailed
first part day. - Exactly. - Basically get 10 30 minutes depending
bright is, try often possible give system regular source- -
Daily best. system really about, see even effect
depression, multiple days is. don't worry missed one
day,



00:33:48 Jetlagged Home? Chronotypes & Early Risers Succeed

stay longer want. hurry want stuff,
great recommendation. - Mm hm, might want compensate extra
time missed day two. - Absolutely. - heard say before,
entirely possible get severely jet lagged without traveling. - Absolutely. - Simply
staying in, phone much, not getting sunlight. - Absolutely.
saw pandemic. lot people mentioned sleep-wake cycles
suffered lot. not going staying home
don't big windows waking late, waking late, using
bright light late night, body going shift. now, day going
start instead like really sun comes up, say six o'clock
morning, day going start 11 o'clock morning.
body's going think beginning day. So, not going able
sleep 10 o'clock night, now really body, completely
different timing. see happen pandemic high
scale. People get delayed sleep-wake cycle lot. - idea
chronotypes, intrinsically best rhythm either morning
person. - Absolutely. - called early person, night owl,
kind standard bed around 10:30, around 7:00 type thing. think
now good data, correct wrong, National Institutes Mental Health
elsewhere showing deviate intrinsic rhythm, mental
health issues physical health issues start crop up. - So, great data this,
couple things complicate this. first people usually
late, tell society doesn't accommodate. - late,
mean? People wake late go sleep late? - Go sleep late wake
late. overwhelmingly higher level depression failures. mean,
clearly, mean, reason people say sleep early, wake early, better
human notice people go sleep early wake early,
better life. notice that. - just perform better? - perform,
question is, intrinsic system society society start things
usually early late? hard question ask- - discriminate late risers.
- way, discriminate, right? explanation Ken Wright's experiment.


late riser, truly chronotypically late, shift easily
put the... really chronotypically late, phase
relation light-dark environment circadian clock,
camping experiment not caused much changes not light
going affect certain way, relationship body
decided late sleeper, late waking. So, honestly, still unable figure
much late waking controlled light environment much
intrinsic. sure differences, big see
environment? people go off sleep 7:00 p.m. wake
1:00 a.m.. clearly advanced phase- - people go sleep 7:00 p.m.
wake 1:00 a.m.? - Yeah. - feel good that? - not sure feel
good, lot time talk people, say high achievers,
suffer go 7:00 p.m., wake advanced phase sleep syndrome.
call syndrome, people not able sleep till 5:00
a.m., not able wake till 3:00 p.m., right? not sure
circadian system variable human population. mean, clearly
maybe genetic factors make small percentage like everything bell
shape. think time, light environment may play role. once,
talked about, long-term effect light. get rhythm,
don't mean pun, reality, get rhythm, hard break
rhythm start sleeping late waking late, not getting
morning sunlight. - Right. - so, just going late. like
waking early, getting morning sunlight. getting Zeitzer said...
said last name wrong. one Stanford the- - Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah. -
Zeitzer, yeah. - [Andrew] actually worked for- - Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer. So, Zeitzer
Czeisler. - Yeah, confusing.

00:38:33 Decide Best Sleep-Wake Schedule; Minimal Light Test

- Yeah, lot zz's i's names. - Yeah. - phenomenal
scientists. - Yeah. - seems case way really know
meant early bird call it, early person late person,
somewhere get morning sunlight, figure whether not
makes feel better. - understand, educated measure


intensity. "How measure" put quotation 'cause either get measuring device,
cannot depend eye measure intensity. - Okay, that?
'Cause keep coming back this. So, tells important. -
important. - So, obviously, apps, free apps like Light Meter, can
walk around hold button see many lux environment. -
complicated point specific regions. - Right. So,
people start develop intuitive sense measurement intensity? -
Yeah, think one point posted Instagram, keep nighttime home.
found night vision strong. found I, especially
winter, need candle lights. literally use tea lights, put like 15 20
them- - romantic. - nice. see clearly doesn't affect
circadian system. - cats- - wife. - wife course. - just
great, right? don't expect people night vision me. So, mean,
tell people, experiment. put three four lights room, switch two,
sit 15 minutes. - Switch two off? - Switch two off. say using five. see,
15 minutes, will not recognize switched two off. gut feeling
people need least 10 times less light use night see.
problem people use time didn't see morning sunlight.
actually hungry light without knowledge. come switch
lights on, wrong time. woke late. - Okay, now understand.
So, morning light viewing goes way beyond- - Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting
clock. also way determine little light need later day. - Exactly. -
going talk moment, little light get later day
strong determinant things like will wake up, whether not
wake feeling refreshed, et cetera. move- - why, - Yeah? - going
break show, Andrew, going tell you, think something else
people need think about, tripartite model. model
incorporate three components talk details allows us humans
animals incorporate circadian clock, relation light, homeostatic
drive, direct effect environment, includes stress, light, kinds
stuff. incorporated together. think, think right now,
think one alone, will always miss something. think
whole, things really become clear. actually quite amazing. - Okay, well, will
definitely want hear tripartite theory go detail


homeostatic mechanisms. want make sure people thinking now,
sure light impacts them. morning light viewing behavior, like
think tacked clearly. - Absolutely. - thank
much information tried relay information. course,
primary source things circadian, well Jamie others,

00:42:16 Viewing Light Middle Day: Mood & “Light Hunger”

course, Matt Walker. think made very, clear. Now, say
gotten morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe bright artificial light,
throughout day said get lot light. So, working desk. Maybe go
day times, working computer, things.
anything light viewing middle day people keep mind?
can just sort freestyle depending doing? people not
dark room throughout day- - Yeah, gut feeling, got morning
sunlight, walk car slowly walk work, didn't wear sunglasses
lights still dim morning, freestyle it. even
don't get lot light, way just... day, don't just worry
getting lot bright light, personally, like that. go lunch
lunch outside well. reminds body even brighter now.
evidence literally help circadian clock giving lights
dawn dusk. again, think tripartite model, may important
circadian clock, important mood? think need,
homeostatic drive. need think it. So, clock,
entraining clock, literally can entrain dawn sunlight. actually
don't need dawn dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah appreciate
distinguishing circadian effects effects lights. - Yes. -
precise, appreciated. hear tripartite model,
will cover, sake discussion, treat light viewing behavior
benefits drawbacks viewing light biological purposes, not just
circadian settings? So, morning, clearly going set clock. then,
day, understand correctly, idea get much bright light can,
feeding, sounds like sort light hunger. - Exactly. - see. - love
way put it. think weird light hunger considering not


photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.

deeper circadian setting behavior come general rules
thumb? So, say bright day. - Mm hm, mm hm. - Extremely bright. No
clouds, sun's out. said 10 minutes, 15 minutes. - tell
sensitive, don't even go sun. shade. going
many photons shade. going perfect. don't even
see sun. don't sun. know, great vitamin D,
different story. skin protect skin. not
area expertise, effect circadian system, long
outside shade sunny day, 10 15 minutes ample amount. -
Okay say kind overcast. know, not particularly bright
solid cloud cover, obviously sun out, not bright. long
think take set clock? - 10 15 sufficient. Stay half
hour. Stay 45 minutes. darker out, stay longer. - Okay
reason, one finds far north, very, dense cloud cover.
long point somebody consider using artificial light source mimic
sunlight? - Yeah, honestly, don't lot information still,
going discuss maybe detail, put
humans artificial conditions, circadian system sensitive light,
reality, real environment, light also affecting aspects independent
setting circadian pacemaker. - Okay. - call direct
effect light mood, example. So, hard figure intensity
need use. haven't done enough experiments 'cause system
discovered just recently. say use bright light morning,
mean, hard give numbers.

00:30:20 Sunlight Simulators, Afternoon Light Viewing, Naps

can get complicated. yeah, mean, honestly, far north
winter make sure don't, use light boxes. suggest
personally, it. - use, actually not designed circadian setting,
930 lux light pad bought bought it, affordable compared
dawn simulating lights. - Yeah, don't need them. - quite expensive,
frankly. - Yeah. - put there. so, just basically, wake morning,
use sun comes out, make sure sun out, go


outside. keep thing day. don't know good bad. good
bad? - I, honestly, don't think exposed bright light day going ever
bad really outside day... Unless, know, worst
going happen temperature high, body's going say don't dehydrate
go sleep. tell actually sometimes hot,
get exposed bright light, sleepier feel afternoon, counter-
intuitive. - Mm hm. protect us, think, dehydration? - think
think human evolution near equator noon certain
time afternoon, hard maintain physiological
homeostatic function, active high temperature time. think napping
way, think major function still... Napping way
somehow take away dangerous zone. maybe people
north say, winter can't wake morning 'cause don't
long light. So, sleep night. summer say, feel like can't
go sleep. put dark curtains. So, think, venturing much
north been... Came problem evolution used certain light
environment completely changed human. animals, think
lived longer, come interesting adaptation actually
measuring even small changes light intensities still occur. so, even
near poles, even though always light, change light
intensity across day-night cycle. So, system, linear, remember told
ipRCGs incredibly linear, can still measure, oh, lower light higher
light organism ability that. - see, yeah, interesting. spent
much time learning fortunately cells, yet never really
appreciated now one hand tracking amount light
understand time relative 24 hour cycle, also keep
mentioning linear measurement intensity; really trying figure
time measuring intensity light. course sun
intense source light available us. So, okay, think nailed
first part day. - Exactly. - Basically get 10 30 minutes depending
bright is, try often possible give system regular source- -
Daily best. system really about, see even effect
depression, multiple days is. don't worry missed one
day,



00:33:48 Jetlagged Home? Chronotypes & Early Risers Succeed

stay longer want. hurry want stuff,
great recommendation. - Mm hm, might want compensate extra
time missed day two. - Absolutely. - heard say before,
entirely possible get severely jet lagged without traveling. - Absolutely. - Simply
staying in, phone much, not getting sunlight. - Absolutely.
saw pandemic. lot people mentioned sleep-wake cycles
suffered lot. not going staying home
don't big windows waking late, waking late, using
bright light late night, body going shift. now, day going
start instead like really sun comes up, say six o'clock
morning, day going start 11 o'clock morning.
body's going think beginning day. So, not going able
sleep 10 o'clock night, now really body, completely
different timing. see happen pandemic high
scale. People get delayed sleep-wake cycle lot. - idea
chronotypes, intrinsically best rhythm either morning
person. - Absolutely. - called early person, night owl,
kind standard bed around 10:30, around 7:00 type thing. think
now good data, correct wrong, National Institutes Mental Health
elsewhere showing deviate intrinsic rhythm, mental
health issues physical health issues start crop up. - So, great data this,
couple things complicate this. first people usually
late, tell society doesn't accommodate. - late,
mean? People wake late go sleep late? - Go sleep late wake
late. overwhelmingly higher level depression failures. mean,
clearly, mean, reason people say sleep early, wake early, better
human notice people go sleep early wake early,
better life. notice that. - just perform better? - perform,
question is, intrinsic system society society start things
usually early late? hard question ask- - discriminate late risers.
- way, discriminate, right? explanation Ken Wright's experiment.


late riser, truly chronotypically late, shift easily
put the... really chronotypically late, phase
relation light-dark environment circadian clock,
camping experiment not caused much changes not light
going affect certain way, relationship body
decided late sleeper, late waking. So, honestly, still unable figure
much late waking controlled light environment much
intrinsic. sure differences, big see
environment? people go off sleep 7:00 p.m. wake
1:00 a.m.. clearly advanced phase- - people go sleep 7:00 p.m.
wake 1:00 a.m.? - Yeah. - feel good that? - not sure feel
good, lot time talk people, say high achievers,
suffer go 7:00 p.m., wake advanced phase sleep syndrome.
call syndrome, people not able sleep till 5:00
a.m., not able wake till 3:00 p.m., right? not sure
circadian system variable human population. mean, clearly
maybe genetic factors make small percentage like everything bell
shape. think time, light environment may play role. once,
talked about, long-term effect light. get rhythm,
don't mean pun, reality, get rhythm, hard break
rhythm start sleeping late waking late, not getting
morning sunlight. - Right. - so, just going late. like
waking early, getting morning sunlight. getting Zeitzer said...
said last name wrong. one Stanford the- - Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah. -
Zeitzer, yeah. - [Andrew] actually worked for- - Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer. So, Zeitzer
Czeisler. - Yeah, confusing.

00:38:33 Decide Best Sleep-Wake Schedule; Minimal Light Test

- Yeah, lot zz's i's names. - Yeah. - phenomenal
scientists. - Yeah. - seems case way really know
meant early bird call it, early person late person,
somewhere get morning sunlight, figure whether not
makes feel better. - understand, educated measure


intensity. "How measure" put quotation 'cause either get measuring device,
cannot depend eye measure intensity. - Okay, that?
'Cause keep coming back this. So, tells important. -
important. - So, obviously, apps, free apps like Light Meter, can
walk around hold button see many lux environment. -
complicated point specific regions. - Right. So,
people start develop intuitive sense measurement intensity? -
Yeah, think one point posted Instagram, keep nighttime home.
found night vision strong. found I, especially
winter, need candle lights. literally use tea lights, put like 15 20
them- - romantic. - nice. see clearly doesn't affect
circadian system. - cats- - wife. - wife course. - just
great, right? don't expect people night vision me. So, mean,
tell people, experiment. put three four lights room, switch two,
sit 15 minutes. - Switch two off? - Switch two off. say using five. see,
15 minutes, will not recognize switched two off. gut feeling
people need least 10 times less light use night see.
problem people use time didn't see morning sunlight.
actually hungry light without knowledge. come switch
lights on, wrong time. woke late. - Okay, now understand.
So, morning light viewing goes way beyond- - Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting
clock. also way determine little light need later day. - Exactly. -
going talk moment, little light get later day
strong determinant things like will wake up, whether not
wake feeling refreshed, et cetera. move- - why, - Yeah? - going
break show, Andrew, going tell you, think something else
people need think about, tripartite model. model
incorporate three components talk details allows us humans
animals incorporate circadian clock, relation light, homeostatic
drive, direct effect environment, includes stress, light, kinds
stuff. incorporated together. think, think right now,
think one alone, will always miss something. think
whole, things really become clear. actually quite amazing. - Okay, well, will
definitely want hear tripartite theory go detail


homeostatic mechanisms. want make sure people thinking now,
sure light impacts them. morning light viewing behavior, like
think tacked clearly. - Absolutely. - thank
much information tried relay information. course,
primary source things circadian, well Jamie others,

00:42:16 Viewing Light Middle Day: Mood & “Light Hunger”

course, Matt Walker. think made very, clear. Now, say
gotten morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe bright artificial light,
throughout day said get lot light. So, working desk. Maybe go
day times, working computer, things.
anything light viewing middle day people keep mind?
can just sort freestyle depending doing? people not
dark room throughout day- - Yeah, gut feeling, got morning
sunlight, walk car slowly walk work, didn't wear sunglasses
lights still dim morning, freestyle it. even
don't get lot light, way just... day, don't just worry
getting lot bright light, personally, like that. go lunch
lunch outside well. reminds body even brighter now.
evidence literally help circadian clock giving lights
dawn dusk. again, think tripartite model, may important
circadian clock, important mood? think need,
homeostatic drive. need think it. So, clock,
entraining clock, literally can entrain dawn sunlight. actually
don't need dawn dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah appreciate
distinguishing circadian effects effects lights. - Yes. -
precise, appreciated. hear tripartite model,
will cover, sake discussion, treat light viewing behavior
benefits drawbacks viewing light biological purposes, not just
circadian settings? So, morning, clearly going set clock. then,
day, understand correctly, idea get much bright light can,
feeding, sounds like sort light hunger. - Exactly. - see. - love
way put it. think weird light hunger considering not


photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.

outside. keep thing day. don't know good bad. good
bad? - I, honestly, don't think exposed bright light day going ever
bad really outside day... Unless, know, worst
going happen temperature high, body's going say don't dehydrate
go sleep. tell actually sometimes hot,
get exposed bright light, sleepier feel afternoon, counter-
intuitive. - Mm hm. protect us, think, dehydration? - think
think human evolution near equator noon certain
time afternoon, hard maintain physiological
homeostatic function, active high temperature time. think napping
way, think major function still... Napping way
somehow take away dangerous zone. maybe people
north say, winter can't wake morning 'cause don't
long light. So, sleep night. summer say, feel like can't
go sleep. put dark curtains. So, think, venturing much
north been... Came problem evolution used certain light
environment completely changed human. animals, think
lived longer, come interesting adaptation actually
measuring even small changes light intensities still occur. so, even
near poles, even though always light, change light
intensity across day-night cycle. So, system, linear, remember told
ipRCGs incredibly linear, can still measure, oh, lower light higher
light organism ability that. - see, yeah, interesting. spent
much time learning fortunately cells, yet never really
appreciated now one hand tracking amount light
understand time relative 24 hour cycle, also keep
mentioning linear measurement intensity; really trying figure
time measuring intensity light. course sun
intense source light available us. So, okay, think nailed
first part day. - Exactly. - Basically get 10 30 minutes depending
bright is, try often possible give system regular source- -
Daily best. system really about, see even effect
depression, multiple days is. don't worry missed one

00:33:48 Jetlagged Home? Chronotypes & Early Risers Succeed

stay longer want. hurry want stuff,
great recommendation. - Mm hm, might want compensate extra
time missed day two. - Absolutely. - heard say before,
entirely possible get severely jet lagged without traveling. - Absolutely. - Simply
staying in, phone much, not getting sunlight. - Absolutely.
saw pandemic. lot people mentioned sleep-wake cycles
suffered lot. not going staying home
don't big windows waking late, waking late, using
bright light late night, body going shift. now, day going
start instead like really sun comes up, say six o'clock
morning, day going start 11 o'clock morning.
body's going think beginning day. So, not going able
sleep 10 o'clock night, now really body, completely
different timing. see happen pandemic high
scale. People get delayed sleep-wake cycle lot. - idea
chronotypes, intrinsically best rhythm either morning
person. - Absolutely. - called early person, night owl,
kind standard bed around 10:30, around 7:00 type thing. think
now good data, correct wrong, National Institutes Mental Health
elsewhere showing deviate intrinsic rhythm, mental
health issues physical health issues start crop up. - So, great data this,
couple things complicate this. first people usually
late, tell society doesn't accommodate. - late,
mean? People wake late go sleep late? - Go sleep late wake
late. overwhelmingly higher level depression failures. mean,
clearly, mean, reason people say sleep early, wake early, better
human notice people go sleep early wake early,
better life. notice that. - just perform better? - perform,
question is, intrinsic system society society start things
usually early late? hard question ask- - discriminate late risers.
- way, discriminate, right? explanation Ken Wright's experiment.


late riser, truly chronotypically late, shift easily
put the... really chronotypically late, phase
relation light-dark environment circadian clock,
camping experiment not caused much changes not light
going affect certain way, relationship body
decided late sleeper, late waking. So, honestly, still unable figure
much late waking controlled light environment much
intrinsic. sure differences, big see
environment? people go off sleep 7:00 p.m. wake
1:00 a.m.. clearly advanced phase- - people go sleep 7:00 p.m.
wake 1:00 a.m.? - Yeah. - feel good that? - not sure feel
good, lot time talk people, say high achievers,
suffer go 7:00 p.m., wake advanced phase sleep syndrome.
call syndrome, people not able sleep till 5:00
a.m., not able wake till 3:00 p.m., right? not sure
circadian system variable human population. mean, clearly
maybe genetic factors make small percentage like everything bell
shape. think time, light environment may play role. once,
talked about, long-term effect light. get rhythm,
don't mean pun, reality, get rhythm, hard break
rhythm start sleeping late waking late, not getting
morning sunlight. - Right. - so, just going late. like
waking early, getting morning sunlight. getting Zeitzer said...
said last name wrong. one Stanford the- - Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah. -
Zeitzer, yeah. - [Andrew] actually worked for- - Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer. So, Zeitzer
Czeisler. - Yeah, confusing.

00:38:33 Decide Best Sleep-Wake Schedule; Minimal Light Test

- Yeah, lot zz's i's names. - Yeah. - phenomenal
scientists. - Yeah. - seems case way really know
meant early bird call it, early person late person,
somewhere get morning sunlight, figure whether not
makes feel better. - understand, educated measure


intensity. "How measure" put quotation 'cause either get measuring device,
cannot depend eye measure intensity. - Okay, that?
'Cause keep coming back this. So, tells important. -
important. - So, obviously, apps, free apps like Light Meter, can
walk around hold button see many lux environment. -
complicated point specific regions. - Right. So,
people start develop intuitive sense measurement intensity? -
Yeah, think one point posted Instagram, keep nighttime home.
found night vision strong. found I, especially
winter, need candle lights. literally use tea lights, put like 15 20
them- - romantic. - nice. see clearly doesn't affect
circadian system. - cats- - wife. - wife course. - just
great, right? don't expect people night vision me. So, mean,
tell people, experiment. put three four lights room, switch two,
sit 15 minutes. - Switch two off? - Switch two off. say using five. see,
15 minutes, will not recognize switched two off. gut feeling
people need least 10 times less light use night see.
problem people use time didn't see morning sunlight.
actually hungry light without knowledge. come switch
lights on, wrong time. woke late. - Okay, now understand.
So, morning light viewing goes way beyond- - Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting
clock. also way determine little light need later day. - Exactly. -
going talk moment, little light get later day
strong determinant things like will wake up, whether not
wake feeling refreshed, et cetera. move- - why, - Yeah? - going
break show, Andrew, going tell you, think something else
people need think about, tripartite model. model
incorporate three components talk details allows us humans
animals incorporate circadian clock, relation light, homeostatic
drive, direct effect environment, includes stress, light, kinds
stuff. incorporated together. think, think right now,
think one alone, will always miss something. think
whole, things really become clear. actually quite amazing. - Okay, well, will
definitely want hear tripartite theory go detail


homeostatic mechanisms. want make sure people thinking now,
sure light impacts them. morning light viewing behavior, like
think tacked clearly. - Absolutely. - thank
much information tried relay information. course,
primary source things circadian, well Jamie others,

00:42:16 Viewing Light Middle Day: Mood & “Light Hunger”

course, Matt Walker. think made very, clear. Now, say
gotten morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe bright artificial light,
throughout day said get lot light. So, working desk. Maybe go
day times, working computer, things.
anything light viewing middle day people keep mind?
can just sort freestyle depending doing? people not
dark room throughout day- - Yeah, gut feeling, got morning
sunlight, walk car slowly walk work, didn't wear sunglasses
lights still dim morning, freestyle it. even
don't get lot light, way just... day, don't just worry
getting lot bright light, personally, like that. go lunch
lunch outside well. reminds body even brighter now.
evidence literally help circadian clock giving lights
dawn dusk. again, think tripartite model, may important
circadian clock, important mood? think need,
homeostatic drive. need think it. So, clock,
entraining clock, literally can entrain dawn sunlight. actually
don't need dawn dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah appreciate
distinguishing circadian effects effects lights. - Yes. -
precise, appreciated. hear tripartite model,
will cover, sake discussion, treat light viewing behavior
benefits drawbacks viewing light biological purposes, not just
circadian settings? So, morning, clearly going set clock. then,
day, understand correctly, idea get much bright light can,
feeding, sounds like sort light hunger. - Exactly. - see. - love
way put it. think weird light hunger considering not


photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,

00:33:48 Jetlagged Home? Chronotypes & Early Risers Succeed

stay longer want. hurry want stuff,
great recommendation. - Mm hm, might want compensate extra
time missed day two. - Absolutely. - heard say before,
entirely possible get severely jet lagged without traveling. - Absolutely. - Simply
staying in, phone much, not getting sunlight. - Absolutely.
saw pandemic. lot people mentioned sleep-wake cycles
suffered lot. not going staying home
don't big windows waking late, waking late, using
bright light late night, body going shift. now, day going
start instead like really sun comes up, say six o'clock
morning, day going start 11 o'clock morning.
body's going think beginning day. So, not going able
sleep 10 o'clock night, now really body, completely
different timing. see happen pandemic high
scale. People get delayed sleep-wake cycle lot. - idea
chronotypes, intrinsically best rhythm either morning
person. - Absolutely. - called early person, night owl,
kind standard bed around 10:30, around 7:00 type thing. think
now good data, correct wrong, National Institutes Mental Health
elsewhere showing deviate intrinsic rhythm, mental
health issues physical health issues start crop up. - So, great data this,
couple things complicate this. first people usually
late, tell society doesn't accommodate. - late,
mean? People wake late go sleep late? - Go sleep late wake
late. overwhelmingly higher level depression failures. mean,
clearly, mean, reason people say sleep early, wake early, better
human notice people go sleep early wake early,
better life. notice that. - just perform better? - perform,
question is, intrinsic system society society start things
usually early late? hard question ask- - discriminate late risers.
- way, discriminate, right? explanation Ken Wright's experiment.


late riser, truly chronotypically late, shift easily
put the... really chronotypically late, phase
relation light-dark environment circadian clock,
camping experiment not caused much changes not light
going affect certain way, relationship body
decided late sleeper, late waking. So, honestly, still unable figure
much late waking controlled light environment much
intrinsic. sure differences, big see
environment? people go off sleep 7:00 p.m. wake
1:00 a.m.. clearly advanced phase- - people go sleep 7:00 p.m.
wake 1:00 a.m.? - Yeah. - feel good that? - not sure feel
good, lot time talk people, say high achievers,
suffer go 7:00 p.m., wake advanced phase sleep syndrome.
call syndrome, people not able sleep till 5:00
a.m., not able wake till 3:00 p.m., right? not sure
circadian system variable human population. mean, clearly
maybe genetic factors make small percentage like everything bell
shape. think time, light environment may play role. once,
talked about, long-term effect light. get rhythm,
don't mean pun, reality, get rhythm, hard break
rhythm start sleeping late waking late, not getting
morning sunlight. - Right. - so, just going late. like
waking early, getting morning sunlight. getting Zeitzer said...
said last name wrong. one Stanford the- - Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah. -
Zeitzer, yeah. - [Andrew] actually worked for- - Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer. So, Zeitzer
Czeisler. - Yeah, confusing.

00:38:33 Decide Best Sleep-Wake Schedule; Minimal Light Test

- Yeah, lot zz's i's names. - Yeah. - phenomenal
scientists. - Yeah. - seems case way really know
meant early bird call it, early person late person,
somewhere get morning sunlight, figure whether not
makes feel better. - understand, educated measure


intensity. "How measure" put quotation 'cause either get measuring device,
cannot depend eye measure intensity. - Okay, that?
'Cause keep coming back this. So, tells important. -
important. - So, obviously, apps, free apps like Light Meter, can
walk around hold button see many lux environment. -
complicated point specific regions. - Right. So,
people start develop intuitive sense measurement intensity? -
Yeah, think one point posted Instagram, keep nighttime home.
found night vision strong. found I, especially
winter, need candle lights. literally use tea lights, put like 15 20
them- - romantic. - nice. see clearly doesn't affect
circadian system. - cats- - wife. - wife course. - just
great, right? don't expect people night vision me. So, mean,
tell people, experiment. put three four lights room, switch two,
sit 15 minutes. - Switch two off? - Switch two off. say using five. see,
15 minutes, will not recognize switched two off. gut feeling
people need least 10 times less light use night see.
problem people use time didn't see morning sunlight.
actually hungry light without knowledge. come switch
lights on, wrong time. woke late. - Okay, now understand.
So, morning light viewing goes way beyond- - Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting
clock. also way determine little light need later day. - Exactly. -
going talk moment, little light get later day
strong determinant things like will wake up, whether not
wake feeling refreshed, et cetera. move- - why, - Yeah? - going
break show, Andrew, going tell you, think something else
people need think about, tripartite model. model
incorporate three components talk details allows us humans
animals incorporate circadian clock, relation light, homeostatic
drive, direct effect environment, includes stress, light, kinds
stuff. incorporated together. think, think right now,
think one alone, will always miss something. think
whole, things really become clear. actually quite amazing. - Okay, well, will
definitely want hear tripartite theory go detail


homeostatic mechanisms. want make sure people thinking now,
sure light impacts them. morning light viewing behavior, like
think tacked clearly. - Absolutely. - thank
much information tried relay information. course,
primary source things circadian, well Jamie others,

00:42:16 Viewing Light Middle Day: Mood & “Light Hunger”

course, Matt Walker. think made very, clear. Now, say
gotten morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe bright artificial light,
throughout day said get lot light. So, working desk. Maybe go
day times, working computer, things.
anything light viewing middle day people keep mind?
can just sort freestyle depending doing? people not
dark room throughout day- - Yeah, gut feeling, got morning
sunlight, walk car slowly walk work, didn't wear sunglasses
lights still dim morning, freestyle it. even
don't get lot light, way just... day, don't just worry
getting lot bright light, personally, like that. go lunch
lunch outside well. reminds body even brighter now.
evidence literally help circadian clock giving lights
dawn dusk. again, think tripartite model, may important
circadian clock, important mood? think need,
homeostatic drive. need think it. So, clock,
entraining clock, literally can entrain dawn sunlight. actually
don't need dawn dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah appreciate
distinguishing circadian effects effects lights. - Yes. -
precise, appreciated. hear tripartite model,
will cover, sake discussion, treat light viewing behavior
benefits drawbacks viewing light biological purposes, not just
circadian settings? So, morning, clearly going set clock. then,
day, understand correctly, idea get much bright light can,
feeding, sounds like sort light hunger. - Exactly. - see. - love
way put it. think weird light hunger considering not


photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

late riser, truly chronotypically late, shift easily
put the... really chronotypically late, phase
relation light-dark environment circadian clock,
camping experiment not caused much changes not light
going affect certain way, relationship body
decided late sleeper, late waking. So, honestly, still unable figure
much late waking controlled light environment much
intrinsic. sure differences, big see
environment? people go off sleep 7:00 p.m. wake
1:00 a.m.. clearly advanced phase- - people go sleep 7:00 p.m.
wake 1:00 a.m.? - Yeah. - feel good that? - not sure feel
good, lot time talk people, say high achievers,
suffer go 7:00 p.m., wake advanced phase sleep syndrome.
call syndrome, people not able sleep till 5:00
a.m., not able wake till 3:00 p.m., right? not sure
circadian system variable human population. mean, clearly
maybe genetic factors make small percentage like everything bell
shape. think time, light environment may play role. once,
talked about, long-term effect light. get rhythm,
don't mean pun, reality, get rhythm, hard break
rhythm start sleeping late waking late, not getting
morning sunlight. - Right. - so, just going late. like
waking early, getting morning sunlight. getting Zeitzer said...
said last name wrong. one Stanford the- - Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah. -
Zeitzer, yeah. - [Andrew] actually worked for- - Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer. So, Zeitzer
Czeisler. - Yeah, confusing.

00:38:33 Decide Best Sleep-Wake Schedule; Minimal Light Test

- Yeah, lot zz's i's names. - Yeah. - phenomenal
scientists. - Yeah. - seems case way really know
meant early bird call it, early person late person,
somewhere get morning sunlight, figure whether not
makes feel better. - understand, educated measure


intensity. "How measure" put quotation 'cause either get measuring device,
cannot depend eye measure intensity. - Okay, that?
'Cause keep coming back this. So, tells important. -
important. - So, obviously, apps, free apps like Light Meter, can
walk around hold button see many lux environment. -
complicated point specific regions. - Right. So,
people start develop intuitive sense measurement intensity? -
Yeah, think one point posted Instagram, keep nighttime home.
found night vision strong. found I, especially
winter, need candle lights. literally use tea lights, put like 15 20
them- - romantic. - nice. see clearly doesn't affect
circadian system. - cats- - wife. - wife course. - just
great, right? don't expect people night vision me. So, mean,
tell people, experiment. put three four lights room, switch two,
sit 15 minutes. - Switch two off? - Switch two off. say using five. see,
15 minutes, will not recognize switched two off. gut feeling
people need least 10 times less light use night see.
problem people use time didn't see morning sunlight.
actually hungry light without knowledge. come switch
lights on, wrong time. woke late. - Okay, now understand.
So, morning light viewing goes way beyond- - Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting
clock. also way determine little light need later day. - Exactly. -
going talk moment, little light get later day
strong determinant things like will wake up, whether not
wake feeling refreshed, et cetera. move- - why, - Yeah? - going
break show, Andrew, going tell you, think something else
people need think about, tripartite model. model
incorporate three components talk details allows us humans
animals incorporate circadian clock, relation light, homeostatic
drive, direct effect environment, includes stress, light, kinds
stuff. incorporated together. think, think right now,
think one alone, will always miss something. think
whole, things really become clear. actually quite amazing. - Okay, well, will
definitely want hear tripartite theory go detail


homeostatic mechanisms. want make sure people thinking now,
sure light impacts them. morning light viewing behavior, like
think tacked clearly. - Absolutely. - thank
much information tried relay information. course,
primary source things circadian, well Jamie others,

00:42:16 Viewing Light Middle Day: Mood & “Light Hunger”

course, Matt Walker. think made very, clear. Now, say
gotten morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe bright artificial light,
throughout day said get lot light. So, working desk. Maybe go
day times, working computer, things.
anything light viewing middle day people keep mind?
can just sort freestyle depending doing? people not
dark room throughout day- - Yeah, gut feeling, got morning
sunlight, walk car slowly walk work, didn't wear sunglasses
lights still dim morning, freestyle it. even
don't get lot light, way just... day, don't just worry
getting lot bright light, personally, like that. go lunch
lunch outside well. reminds body even brighter now.
evidence literally help circadian clock giving lights
dawn dusk. again, think tripartite model, may important
circadian clock, important mood? think need,
homeostatic drive. need think it. So, clock,
entraining clock, literally can entrain dawn sunlight. actually
don't need dawn dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah appreciate
distinguishing circadian effects effects lights. - Yes. -
precise, appreciated. hear tripartite model,
will cover, sake discussion, treat light viewing behavior
benefits drawbacks viewing light biological purposes, not just
circadian settings? So, morning, clearly going set clock. then,
day, understand correctly, idea get much bright light can,
feeding, sounds like sort light hunger. - Exactly. - see. - love
way put it. think weird light hunger considering not


photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

intensity. "How measure" put quotation 'cause either get measuring device,
cannot depend eye measure intensity. - Okay, that?
'Cause keep coming back this. So, tells important. -
important. - So, obviously, apps, free apps like Light Meter, can
walk around hold button see many lux environment. -
complicated point specific regions. - Right. So,
people start develop intuitive sense measurement intensity? -
Yeah, think one point posted Instagram, keep nighttime home.
found night vision strong. found I, especially
winter, need candle lights. literally use tea lights, put like 15 20
them- - romantic. - nice. see clearly doesn't affect
circadian system. - cats- - wife. - wife course. - just
great, right? don't expect people night vision me. So, mean,
tell people, experiment. put three four lights room, switch two,
sit 15 minutes. - Switch two off? - Switch two off. say using five. see,
15 minutes, will not recognize switched two off. gut feeling
people need least 10 times less light use night see.
problem people use time didn't see morning sunlight.
actually hungry light without knowledge. come switch
lights on, wrong time. woke late. - Okay, now understand.
So, morning light viewing goes way beyond- - Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting
clock. also way determine little light need later day. - Exactly. -
going talk moment, little light get later day
strong determinant things like will wake up, whether not
wake feeling refreshed, et cetera. move- - why, - Yeah? - going
break show, Andrew, going tell you, think something else
people need think about, tripartite model. model
incorporate three components talk details allows us humans
animals incorporate circadian clock, relation light, homeostatic
drive, direct effect environment, includes stress, light, kinds
stuff. incorporated together. think, think right now,
think one alone, will always miss something. think
whole, things really become clear. actually quite amazing. - Okay, well, will
definitely want hear tripartite theory go detail


homeostatic mechanisms. want make sure people thinking now,
sure light impacts them. morning light viewing behavior, like
think tacked clearly. - Absolutely. - thank
much information tried relay information. course,
primary source things circadian, well Jamie others,

00:42:16 Viewing Light Middle Day: Mood & “Light Hunger”

course, Matt Walker. think made very, clear. Now, say
gotten morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe bright artificial light,
throughout day said get lot light. So, working desk. Maybe go
day times, working computer, things.
anything light viewing middle day people keep mind?
can just sort freestyle depending doing? people not
dark room throughout day- - Yeah, gut feeling, got morning
sunlight, walk car slowly walk work, didn't wear sunglasses
lights still dim morning, freestyle it. even
don't get lot light, way just... day, don't just worry
getting lot bright light, personally, like that. go lunch
lunch outside well. reminds body even brighter now.
evidence literally help circadian clock giving lights
dawn dusk. again, think tripartite model, may important
circadian clock, important mood? think need,
homeostatic drive. need think it. So, clock,
entraining clock, literally can entrain dawn sunlight. actually
don't need dawn dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah appreciate
distinguishing circadian effects effects lights. - Yes. -
precise, appreciated. hear tripartite model,
will cover, sake discussion, treat light viewing behavior
benefits drawbacks viewing light biological purposes, not just
circadian settings? So, morning, clearly going set clock. then,
day, understand correctly, idea get much bright light can,
feeding, sounds like sort light hunger. - Exactly. - see. - love
way put it. think weird light hunger considering not


photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

homeostatic mechanisms. want make sure people thinking now,
sure light impacts them. morning light viewing behavior, like
think tacked clearly. - Absolutely. - thank
much information tried relay information. course,
primary source things circadian, well Jamie others,

00:42:16 Viewing Light Middle Day: Mood & “Light Hunger”

course, Matt Walker. think made very, clear. Now, say
gotten morning sunlight. Okay, great. Maybe bright artificial light,
throughout day said get lot light. So, working desk. Maybe go
day times, working computer, things.
anything light viewing middle day people keep mind?
can just sort freestyle depending doing? people not
dark room throughout day- - Yeah, gut feeling, got morning
sunlight, walk car slowly walk work, didn't wear sunglasses
lights still dim morning, freestyle it. even
don't get lot light, way just... day, don't just worry
getting lot bright light, personally, like that. go lunch
lunch outside well. reminds body even brighter now.
evidence literally help circadian clock giving lights
dawn dusk. again, think tripartite model, may important
circadian clock, important mood? think need,
homeostatic drive. need think it. So, clock,
entraining clock, literally can entrain dawn sunlight. actually
don't need dawn dusk. People usually forget that. - Yeah appreciate
distinguishing circadian effects effects lights. - Yes. -
precise, appreciated. hear tripartite model,
will cover, sake discussion, treat light viewing behavior
benefits drawbacks viewing light biological purposes, not just
circadian settings? So, morning, clearly going set clock. then,
day, understand correctly, idea get much bright light can,
feeding, sounds like sort light hunger. - Exactly. - see. - love
way put it. think weird light hunger considering not


photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

photosynthetic organisms. weird light hungers animals need
measure. think relates season whole reproduction cycle
animals going depend availability food environment. don't
know season going happen, don't calendars, going
hard survive. think light hunger.

00:44:55 Evening Sunlight; Blueblocker Warning

major hypothesis. not tested. - Interesting. So, afternoon
evening start approach. So, weird experience. Maybe can
psychologically biologically diagnosed now, Samer. So, go movie
afternoon, like matinee. - Uh huh. - come dark, notice
significant drop mood ability go sleep. Whereas get view
light evening, doesn't sunset, although sunsets nice,
get light pulse afternoon no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. -
happens single time watch them? - Yeah, less. - Wow,
interesting. - mentioned camping experiment went
camping, seeing sunrise sunset. - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. -
people afternoon slash evening time terms light viewing
behavior? - mean, best thing let natural light creep darkness,
right? best, clearly inefficient. want go home,
want read, want talk kids, want talk family. So, think
nice extend day. don't think wrong. somehow can block light
affecting circadian clock. - So, people use blue blockers
evening? - personally not like blockers take single wavelength light.
again, think holistic approach, yes, blue blocker going
prevent affecting circadian clock much. vision going
distorted always see full spectrum, sun beautiful
spectrum, right? start seeing without blue, things look yellow
can get really weird, right? mean, personally, tried blue blocker
couldn't even wear them. thought just really horrendous honest. - Well,
along lines blue blockers, think lot people mistakenly wear day long.
- Oh God, bad. - lot people that. - bad.
- lot people that. think blue light bad. think the- - No, no, no. -


concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop

fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.

concept blue light bad led lot product development. lot
people just assuming viewing blue light giving headaches.
fact might've just looking screens close distance day. - So,
problem, right? mean, blue light got bad reputation people
gave pure blue light showed 'caused huge retinal damage. again,
using blue light pure form, lot energy shorter
wavelength, talking full spectrum light. ways now
change spectrum light keep white day night
change content color without noticing. don't even affect
vision. - go that? - So, just lower level
blue light. don't eliminate it. - just dim lights? - Dim blue,
increase yellow, keep colors certain white. So, know,
different warmness white. people know this. Physicist know
this. People work light know this. - Well, maybe somebody
wellness slash, don't like word, biohacking, optical community will this.
think really important, see many people wearing blue blockers. -
meetings now. don't know block- - Well, think just uninformed. think,
frankly- - Yeah honest, easy, right? easier explain somebody
ipRCGs respond mostly blue, remove blue, fine. - Right, right. - Right?
not simple also receive rod cone input. want
actually... go details, boring listeners, also affect
adaptation properties whole retina. don't want something
drastic

00:48:57 Blue Light Not Issue; Samer’s Cave; Complete Darkness

take just one color spectrum. just seems counter intuitive me,
honest. - told well, just intrinsically
photosensitive circadian setting ganglion cells respond best blue light, light
bright enough also get input components eye, doesn't
matter block blues. - Yeah. - looking bright light night,
going disrupt circadian cycle. - Absolutely didn't want go
boring details, themselves, photoreceptors wide range
responsiveness. sensitive blue light, doesn't mean


don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

don't respond green light shorter blue light. respond very, wide
spectrum different sensitivity. unless understand system just removing
480, don't think going do- - 480 nanometers, yeah. So, home cave
night basically some- - nice cave. - nice cave. - Yeah. - candles. -
right. - Right cats- - watch TV dim it. - lovely
wife. - Yeah. - know, also phenomenal scientist right. - Thank
you, yeah, is. - is. keep home quite dim dark night? -
Yeah. fact, go meetings friends work
really struggled me. said broken legs living
light environment do. extreme, measured myself.
asked, Rejji, wife, okay it. also liked dimness. us can see
well dim conditions. helps us lot, think measure
yourself. really to... simple experiment. Just try dim light
much can. call minimum amount light require see comfortably. -
want environment ideally night? - night. think
game changer. reach level just barely, literally
cusp seeing uncomfortably versus seeing comfortably, going
much better don't like make completely dark. think complete darkness induce
anxiety humans, honest. don't like complete darkness. - Kids don't like
complete darkness. like nightlight. - Even animal, even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness. mean, studies animals nocturnal,
put complete darkness several weeks, severe anxiety
depression like effect. keep light dim, use red light dim, want
keep room sleeping. Red light dim small effect
circadian clock. 10 lux red light, literally doesn't affect sleep all.
ways it. just need educate public. feel like literally need
whole lecture just explain people deal light not
simple people think. - Well, here. - Yeah. - stepping
piece piece reason not simple
saying, just block blue light get lot light day, minimal night. -
mean, just put perspective tell three different cones
retina respond three different colors. call red cones simplicity, green
cones blue cones. Yet three these, see massive
palette colors. tells something. system just simply


single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions

single color us just removing 480 just blue sufficient, see
red, yellow, blue. shouldn't see different hues color,
system not that, see different colors. important
remind people white light made many different colors. actually like
rainbow. see rainbow, made many colors. White light never
truly white. made lot different colors. - like Pink Floyd album cover. -
Exactly. - light coming prism. - Exactly, exactly. - So, dim night,
maybe dim red light ideally, candle light. Find minimum required light level. - Test
it, just make sure lower lights, sit least 10 15 minutes, let
system adapt. bright light switch off, surely going
suffer system didn't adapt yet; used bright light.
want engage rods, take long time dark adapt. tell you,
just wait little bit. Don't just switch off now don't see, put on. Put off, sit
down, wait 10 minutes, ideally 15 minutes see see.

00:53:58 Screens Night

that, will notice actually, yeah, see quite well even
much less light. - regarding screens? - Yeah, hardest
thing. Again, mean, beautiful programs change whole intensity
color screen. help dim screen night lowest part. mean,
yes, won't see wake morning, can increase
intensity. So, try decrease. mean, just talking about. Think light
intensity, duration, color, time day. really keep four things
together, right? - roomed together couple meetings time time, no
longer, one us not named severe snoring issue made
one pseudo-homicidal. [Samer laughing] can guess was.
seen check phone dark twice. - Mm hm. - sort
pointing phone away you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. - actually
sort half joking, dim quite bit. - Yeah, dim quite lot. - sort half
joking, actually makes sense shine flashlight eye, much
brighter shine flashlight- - Light go direct line, just look
side, light going go way, seeing way. -
Okay, so, silly might seem people listening, mean means


getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

getting bright light eyes night something really want avoid.
reality that- - even check sometimes something,
check fast switch off fast. also aware duration- - Not
messages. - also aware duration, right? duration, intensity, color, time
day. Ideally not check iPhones iPads. don't use iPad night
hard lower enough 'cause huge. even iPhone, try not use night.
like becomes 8:30 9:00, don't look all. - Unless World Cup
Euro Cup, case Samer's 24 hours, everybody.

00:56:03 Dangers Bright Light 10 pm 4 am: Mood & Learning

- Right, every four years. - big soccer fan. right,
incredibly, no pun, illuminating. talk relationship light
non-circadian pseudo-circadian effects. will try link those.
consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published "Nature"
years ago, showing disrupt exposure light timing
exposure light dramatic effects stress system learning
memory system. Maybe talk separately together.
effects stress effects learning light viewing behavior
sleep-wake cycles disrupted? - Yeah, just remind you, know that,
remind listeners trained circadian biologist. really
indoctrinated thinking light affect clock, caused
different effects. So, believe. dogma. made
really happy. Tara LeGates Cara Altimus joined lab started
discussing lot data. said, direct effect light
missing, independent circadian clock? not easy question us
answer, talking along, light affects circadian clock.
give light different times day not mess circadian
clock? Luckily, came way, important
experiments way them. proved light-dark cycle not
disrupt clock, still circadian rhythm, not cause sleep deprivation.
yet, surprisingly, give light wrong time day, even without
disrupting circadian clock without causing sleep deprivation, mentioned
get huge mood changes organisms get learning deficit. So,


really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

really, time people really hit us hard. mean, really hard publish
work could, yeah. - Well, came "Nature." - Yeah. - end
prevailed, want make sure understand. So, saying yes,
effects light circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep
wakefulness. - Yes. - timing. However, direct effects light mood
can dissociated effects sleep waking. - Absolutely. -
interpret correctly, mean view light much light,
make us feel happier less happy even depressed, stressed, learning, et
cetera. - Bingo. - Even sleeping waking appropriate time? - Bingo.
mean, eventually talking whole system, eventually
start problems, also develop sleep problems, absolutely
right. fact, now, research Diego Fernandez lab found now
know actually require different brain regions. don't
theory, don't light environment showed can dissociated,
know use completely different brain regions. So, SCN told
earlier, place central pacemaker is, one receives direct input
retina ipRCGs adjust circadian clock not area receives
light input mood regulation. completely different brain region. -
brain region called? - brain region, called perihabenular nucleus. not
sure good bad name, doesn't matter, PHb. really
amazing, region also receives direct input ipRCGs, projects areas
brain known regulate mood, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
studied many years impacted human depression. just
amazing serendipity find region deep advanced brain,
like prefrontal cortex executive brain, one elaborated humans,
see receive inputs ancient photoreceptor stunning us,
told us much didn't understand importance light human behavior. -
So, finding inform daily protocols people? realize
can't leap always one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - daily protocol. light
indeed control prefrontal cortex,

01:01:05 Tripartite Model: Circadian, Sleep Drive, Feeding Schedules

executive function, learning, stress mood, say waking morning


sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

sleeping. different? - came tripartite
model yes, think just adjusting clock lights
dark throughout day. may not important whole physiological
function. So, now, include effects light, prefer still get
lot light day. don't want dim light condition throughout day. -
see. - So, even though doesn't affect clock, beautifully said, Andrew,
may affect mood learning memory. may affect alertness level,
going allow learn better. may affect homeostatic drive, maybe
homeostatic factor go higher sleep earlier. important think
light stimulating brain regions, means producing activity,
reality people think homeostatic drive, active
are, homeostatic drive built up, better sleep.
came tripartite model circadian biologist, thought
light circadian clock affecting behavior. sleep biologist,
thought homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. people
study light vision form, thought environmental input.
now put together, get tripartite model really mind
boggling. makes much sense. organism doesn't want depend
single component, incorporate three together,
beautiful system well adapted. let tell sleep-wake cycle, right?
know homeostatic drive affect sleep. beautiful talks
that. - basically longer awake, want asleep.
- So, homeostatic drive. talked circadian influence sleep
fact light-dark cycle affect circadian system, eventually affects
sleep. two components well understood. Now third factor direct
light environmental input. much stress, much light get also
can highly impact sleep. even good circadian homeostatic drive,
getting light wrong time day, stressed thinking
lot, sleep going suffer. think three together
beautiful sleep-wake cycle. - see. - came tripartite
model. thing happens feeding. beautifully put people.
hunger, energy level measured arcuate nucleus. daily intake food
again, dependent SCN light-dark input. found food not
available, yet third input not depending SCN, not depend


arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions

arcuate, depending completely different brain regions. animal can actually
start looking human can start looking food scarce, even time
not supposed active. So, organism think,
evaluate multiple inputs decide best physiological outcome
moment, season? - see. So, want get arcuate feeding, just
make sure can keep hands around tripartite model. So, understand
correctly, got circadian influence, also got drive sleep. -
Right. - Actually, one ways think can best understood somebody
ever pulls all-nighter, get tired around 11:00 12:00 so, tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m., even stay sometime right around 7:00 8:00
a.m., normal wake time, start feel alert again. - Exactly. -
sleep drive extremely strong, circadian rhythm drives
wakefulness morning. - Exactly. - Okay, two components. -
[Samer] Right. - get feeding component, want talk
direct effects light mood. - Mm hm.

01:05:05 Using Light Enhance Mood; & Hattar-Hernandez Nucleus

- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. perihabenular thing. - Sure. - So, just
moment set aside tri part tripartite model just focus
direct effects light mood? way interpret said far
protocol emerges one trying optimize mood is, yes, see light,
view light say, early day, order set circadian clock. Maybe also
evening well. course, avoid light night, get dim possible.
However, said, also good idea get much bright light day
safely can, order improve mood independently regulating sleep-wake
cycle. - hypothesis. problem not going
satisfying circadian know, brain region discovered
recently. - Habenula? - perihabenular region. - Well, known
long time, nobody knew did. - So, knew habenula,
name confusing. actually not habenula itself. perihabenular. - Oh,
near habenula. - near habenula. - don't just call Samer Hattar
nucleus? - have. don't know haven't done that. - Maybe 'cause
that, not okay. Okay, ever perihabenular nucleus,


probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

probably call Hattar- - Hattar-Fernandez. - Hattar-Fernandez-
Berson nucleus. - Yeah, should- - Okay, like nerdy science attribution stuff,
just going call Hattar nucleus. Wikipedia, line up. Okay, structure
taking light, independent sleep rhythms circadian rhythms, driving
changes mood. - Something. - that? dopamine
system? serotonin system? - still recently, haven't identified region
well. don't know light it. don't know interacts.
area ripe discoveries working right now. said,
not satisfying. like function sleep. sleep? know sleep
important us, still don't satisfying function sleep,
right? - see questions- - hypothesis. - questions, think
good friend colleague University Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
always says, somebody asks why, best answer just say, wasn't
consulted design phase. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, none us really know why. - No,
point

01:07:19 Sleep?

maybe shouldn't said why, function sleep? still hard
know. reason organisms go offline long? know, people
assume repair, assume learning memory, assume kind stuff,
really no clear function sleeping. no clear function sleeping.
mean, talk people, hypotheses. - mean, know
don't sleep- - Exactly. - sleep fractured, get messed up. -
die even, right? mean, really bad don't sleep, don't know
function? sleep done organisms couldn't done
rest? just rest without sleeping? Just sit rest. - Well, lab
trying figure whether not non-sleep deep rest protocols can
compensate sleep. - interesting. - mean, obviously sleep better,
many people not getting

01:08:17 Effects Light Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times

sleep need. - Right. - But, okay. So, people sensing Samer


start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

start talking arguing, always goal
talk, right? - right. - Unlike scientists interact with, Samer
get together, considered successful conversation get big fight,
go big meal- - right. - pick restaurant. [Samer chuckling] Okay,
talk food eating appetite. yet another, yes, greatly
admire success way, yet another incredible discovery showing
direct effects light appetite feeding behavior. Okay, maybe just
summarize results people. - Honestly, paper one allowed us
come tripartite model, thinking completely wrong it.
wanted, experiment, it'd fun audience hear started
experiment. Remember discovered ipRCGs, figured
relay entrain circadian clock, kill animal
opposite one spoke human opposite one spoke
earlier. instead no pattern vision circadian photoentrainment,
produce animal pattern vision, no circadian photoentrainment.
- Hm, circadian blind. - Circadian blind, pattern sighted. succeeded
that. problem animals, told many times already
don't adjust day-night cycle. experiments become
complicated. - behavior like don't cells?
awake asleep, awake asleep? - just drift like humans
talked about. - think Las Vegas no clocks watch- - drift,
exactly. - stay later every night go sleep- - can either, depend
clock. clock shorter, come earlier. clock longer, come
later. - really messed up? - really don't adjust it.
wild, eliminated second, right? no way survive. So,
Diego started talking like, use non-light training agent?
strongest non-light training agent? Food. thought light defective
animals will sensitivity food entrainment know
me, area worked really well on, vision, image blind,
hearing somatosensory get improved, right? lack vision improves
hearing sensation. found actually don't light system,
actually food ability entrain animal goes completely ground. Completely
opposite predicted. - light viewing feeding behavior interacting
ways support one another. - came tripartite model.


figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

figured different sensation environment. sense vision,
vision hearing interact, vision real full modality. want see.
vision wants do. want hear. hearing wants do. want
sense. sensing want do. circadian system, light, food,
entraining agent, somehow interact keep coherent system. don't
just assume remove light, one going stronger. No, need know
others. light informs animal going eat. - Well, like
much world outside science, don't really exist in,
see lot of, kind wellness stuff mind-body integration stuff.
interesting people view body system, right? system
organs interact, opposed way standard science medical
profession like, work liver ear, nose throat, heart lung,
brain or- - Wow, great way thinking it. - biology integrated. -
Yeah. - so, somebody interested effecting eating behavior,
something familiar with, will talk experiences
moment, use light order adjust eating behavior? -
Right. So, now told interaction different inputs
circadian clock, just think engineer, best
thing? best thing know food times happen day,
get light, circadian clock system, right? So, eat
specific times day, another signal telling body, clock,
certain time day. lunch correct time every
day, getting bright light, now two systems informing
clock, clock going better. - regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes
fit circadian clock. So, fact, that, started this,
helped lose weight, exposing right amount light-dark cycle,
eating regular time. amazing. not hungry, say eat
noon, will not feel hunger 11:45. sudden hunger jumps.
clearly not energy issue not drastic. - No, desire
eat mainly driven cues, hormone cues exquisitely timed
to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, also light. - Exactly. know, wild,
imagine energy level arcuate nucleus- - explain
people arcuate 'cause don't think done adequately. arcuate
nucleus area hypothalamus drives hunger feeding behavior.


talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

talking fact taking cues viewing light, believe
not, impacting level hunger. non-trivial way
timing hunger amount hunger regulated much light
view. So, let ask couple practical- - can just, really,
asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. said going fight, me,
interesting thing think it, wild didn't availability food
have, arcuate plays huge important role weren't successful
getting food, arcuate going tell you, look, take risks go
get food energy level low. great, tons great
research that. think missing fact humans, not getting
situation... us, not getting situation low energy
levels. time actually eat not really low energy,
want eat. think feel timing important
us always enough energy level us eat. - Well, mean, enjoy
eating much eat just sensation chewing. - True, true. - mean,
enjoy taste too. - True, absolutely. - enjoy social aspects
part it. - Absolutely. - literally enjoyed physical act chewing. - [Samer]
Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - explains lot. Okay, regular
recommend people mealtimes? hearing light
viewing behavior pretty straightforward. Get lot light morning
throughout day, minimize evening night, generally speaking, sake
mood circadian rhythm. sake regulating timing quality also
say food intake, people clearly make better choices food intake
anticipating meal aren't constantly hungry. so, ability
regulate hunger particular phases circadian cycle quite valuable
people. Not just people trying lose weight, people. talking
minute? - Absolutely not. - right, 12:00 noon normal lunch, say plus
minus? - Half hour. - Okay. eat around 11:30 12:30. -
time. depends also multiple meals. Remember three meals,
decision somebody came with, don't know why. - nowadays, fewer people
think. - Yeah. - Given friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. mean,
two meals, multiple meals distributed
across active time. agree Satchin Panda's work try avoid eating
system supposed relaxing, supposed non-active times.


So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

So, limit eating active time cycle. seemed be, Joe
Takashi beautiful stuff this, seems incredibly important
aspect circadian. - health. - health. - Yeah, referring
Satchin Panda's work, wrote beautiful book called "The Circadian Code." Maybe
Samer, luck write book well. Meaning world will lucky
book, Satchin's data really strongly point fact liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors, endocrine factors various systems organs seem
benefit period 24 hour day not eating anything
eating regular mealtimes.

01:18:08 Samer’s Experience Adjusting Meal Timing

- [Samer] Absolutely. - talk eating mealtimes move little bit
away science moment, although will return it, talk little bit
experience eating mealtimes. So, looking good
shape lately. - Thank you. - know putting work it. - Yeah. - talk
lot exercising eating well, meaning quality food.
just came back Jordan assuming food amazing. - Yes, food
amazing honestly, usually gain lot weight Jordan, time didn't gain
weight, really nice, so. - Yeah, met you, probably
100 pounds heavier now. - Yeah, 275 pounds. 219 now. crazy,
yeah. - lot vigor then, lot vigor now, know
undertook specific protocol order lose weight, based
understanding circadian system- - Yes! - light, appetite mood.
Maybe just tell us little bit schedule looks like.
realize not prescriptive everybody, found worked you. -
Yeah. - maybe just describe changes. - mean, honestly, followed
circadian cycle, right? talked about, right? dimmed light night,
slept regular hours, ate major food breakfast lunch really active
really hungry. night avoid dinner, circadian system
really shuts off 3:00. early person. Like give anything eat
3:00, 3:00, nothing appeals anymore. system shut off. - Well,
time going sleep? time waking up? - Oh,
case, put up. mean, go sleep literally 9:00 p.m.. mean,


literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

literally five minutes 9:00 p.m., completely out. wake 4:30
5:00 a.m.. extend it, go 6:00 a.m., rarely. depends tired
was. - that, recall, important set changes able to- -
Absolutely. - Regulate food intake. - Absolutely big
breakfast, different people different, big breakfast 7:00 a.m.
maximum. big breakfast, coffee, stuff. simple
snack around 10:00. regularly lunch noon, noon 1:00.
another snack 3:00. hardest time regulate food 12:00
3:00. really feel hungry time. - equivalent kind
late evening people. - Yes! - me, probably 7:00
10:00 p.m.. - Exactly, exactly. - Got it. - night completely not hungry,
usually said, beauty enjoyment food, like wife cooks
really beautiful Indian food, eat, not hungry. notice eat that,
usually gain weight. regulate night, also lose weight.
combination things help adjust input food, input light,
input clock, drive hunger. - Yeah, appreciate sharing that.
want emphasize people not hungry early day. might
late shifted people. - Exactly. - case, eating later day will work well
them. - will work well long don't eat early morning. just,
work schedule, active schedule. - Yeah,
talking offline years. glad finally discussion publicly
now. talking really finding ideal sleep schedule. - Exactly,
exactly. - finding ideal eating schedule. - Exactly. - understanding
two things interact. - know nice thing, said, finding
going help understand interact know tripartite
model interconnected. person going
interconnected differently. So, person would... know, me,
exercise night, going mess whole system. - exercise? -
Morning. Morning works great me. mean, amazing. Morning exercise
works great. tried one time, easier exercise night
leave, traffic night. think messed
couldn't sleep well couldn't wake well. led changes food.
gained weight actually, believe not, even though exercising. think
really makes think think tripartite model see


best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

best times best interrelation different component,
beautifully said,

01:22:51 Using Light Align Sleep, Mood, Feeding, Exercise & Cognition

mealtimes, light exposure, sleep works you. - Well,
thanks that. Usually Samer's insulting me. Today, complimenting me. going
compliment right back saying, first time ever really
understood yes, light can control sleep. Yes, control mood. Yes, can impact
feeding, really self exploration align way
works best. hearing, tell wrong, hearing
understand gives best sleep-wake cycle, exercise
period time feel alert. works schedule,
ideally also eat time feel alert stop
eating stop light viewing behavior head towards sleep. - Right. So,
thing say complicates this, makes sad, light
exposure. - Mine personally? - Sorry. - No, just kidding. - people's light
exposure, right? complicates not going able figure
shifting comfort zone. - viewing- - viewing
light wrong time day. So, say ideal natural
conditions, person sleep later me. say sleep
midnight wake 8:00 a.m.. say don't eat anything till noon,
said, eat late evening. perfect you, now see
happens now include light component. Now, push sleep
midnight 4:00 a.m., now waking morning actually really not
morning... working, sorry, noon instead eight o'clock, time
not supposed hungry, now going start eating directly
noon something like that, even delay it. now shifting whole cycle.
don't know interaction sleep, feeding light-dark
environment still going maintained not. problem people
have. - So, hearing realizing us, probably included,
messing least one, two, three components. - Exactly, exactly. -
probe, way figure right oneself start manipulating light
exposure. - Right going honest, biased 'cause believe light


strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

strongest time giver. lot people disagree. people think feeding is. -
always thought light primary zeitgeber, primary light- - Yeah, lot
people think food. lot people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. -
read literature? - agree you. totally agree you. - mean,
understanding light powerful driver- - Absolutely. - things
talking about. - think need regulate first everything else fits.
know, nice thing sleep-wake cycle exercise tell really
bluntly right not. - Tell that. - tell more.
shifted exercise, honestly, things fell apart like never before. - moved
exercising early day late day? - morn, yeah. completely fell apart
me. didn't enjoy exercise night. pain tolerance exercise wasn't good.
talking N equals one aware this. never tested empirically,
least me, really messed everything. started problem body
temperature go will affect sleep. possibly running gym
lot lights. maybe light component, me, exercising
morning, much better me. lot people can't even think exercising
morning. depends feel comfortable sleep-wake cycle
exercise. think tells system synchrony one another. -
really interesting. good friends, friend, Pat Dossett, know. -
Mm hm, oh, absolutely. - nine years Seal Teams. one
people says, happy go run swim anytime 4:30 a.m.
6:00 a.m.. train afternoon 'cause Seal Team guy
whatever anytime, part phenotype, feels best that, right? like
exercise mid-morning. - Interesting. - happy skip eating 12 1:00. -
Great. - like go sleep around 11:30, 12:00, 'cause normal human
rather goes bed 9:00 p.m. - Pat actually? never
asked time. - Pat? So, Pat's ideal sleep time, asked this,
around 8:30 9:00 except now- - Oh, like Pat! - Yes, two young
children, two years old newborn. so, cycle disrupted, right? - Yeah,
known, right? mean effect childbearing. - Right. - think
talk this, complicated- - Right. - pretty much. - Yeah, mean,
think need come new name chronotype because- - agree, agree.
- Chronotype implies just sleep wake; early bird night
owl. also talking exercise eating match onto those. -


phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation

thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

phase relation them. - Right. - phases different
components, said. - 'Cause interact. - interact. - Right. -
don't phase. Like say light food
close other. light food different, right? phases don't
be, can plastic. find yourself. maybe
person eats late night, exercises late night, may person
exercise early, eat later. So, long phase good, find
out. - Okay understand correctly, talking phase relationship,
means want lump exercise, feeding light for- - sleep. - sleep
way coherent total system makes feel really good. - Temporally
great order. - Uh uh. - Absolutely. - think that- - tell literally
getting exposed sun clearly morning, clearly noon, go out, keep
windows office completely open, eating mostly early time day
exercising. literally end part day, not really thoughtful
vegetative state. Like really can't like 5:00, tell students, want tell
anything complicated, wasting time. brain just doesn't function. even
though sleep night, really starting shut off, ramp down. Really mean,
send email, talk brainless stuff, power, energy powerful
stuff really drop tremendously. students know well, put
meetings early morning 'cause know I'm... So,
everything me, tight. different for...
clustered morning. tied together. literally remaining part seems
just vegetative state. - Mm hm. Yeah, bulldog, Costello,
unfortunately passed away recently. - Oh no. - Yeah. - not, sad. - Yeah,
Samer Costello good friends. Yeah, sorry break here. Yeah,
good long life went easy, circadian clock basically just
sleep around 24 hours day,

01:30:15 Age-Related Changes Timing Mental & Physical Vigor

minimal activity interspersed every third day so. morning vigor. -
Yes. - think people going afternoon vigor.
think can change across lifespan? rumor teenagers naturally
want sleep later stay later. think social rhythm?


think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied

allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

think actually biological? - Yeah, tough question. mean,
both. One thing worries seems anything, age morning
rigor gets stronger. - mean, want people become morning people. -
morning people. - Well, worry you? think good. -
me, already shifted morning. don't want one 7:00 p.m. 1:00
a.m. sleepers point. - hand, also kind nice quiet
can get work done. - Yeah, honestly 4:30 till 7:30 wife wake
up, can long. Yes, achieved lot, quiet outside. So, don't want
1:00 a.m., put way. - can tell Samer social am. -
right, true. - touch actually. So, wife, follows
different schedule. - Yeah. - So, social rhythm- - honestly... - important
think. do? conceptualize adjust
according social rhythm? - honestly love hypothesis

01:31:44 “Chrono-Attraction” Relationships; Social-Rhythms

people came Pat's kids reminded of. kids really going
disrupt sleep-wake cycle, seems like chrono attraction. usually
people attract others actually different sleep-wake schedule.
idea allows take care kids throughout day-night
cycle. - peaceful marriage. - peaceful marriage way, right?
So, mean, didn't kids, Rejji. maybe is, seems like
evolutionary makes sense want protect kids, don't want
everybody morning vigor, kids don't have. want distributed
across. mean, makes sense. - reasonable argument. - Yeah. - heard
one reasons people think clock not exactly 24 hours, 24
hours plus minus 20 minutes so, believe evolved clans
groups, villages, whatever, 100 200 people. order
protection around early morning hours- - Interesting, idea. -
vulnerable predation late night hours, want individuals
species naturally like night owls like early people.
theory parenting similar way. - Right. - social rhythm powerful
rhythm though. Meaning go tired, say tired like 9:30. don't
want go out, like need- - can just say something that? think


social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions

social rhythm powerful obvious levels. Like affects sleep, affects
much wake eat, not sure powerful people think
clock. Now, eventually will mess clock now lot
social night, getting enough light, eating wrong time day, eventually
going effect, don't think just social interactions
shown affect clock strongly

01:33:40 Re-setting Clock Schedule; Screen Devices Revisited

reason. - Yeah, good know. Well, people hearing this,
probably getting impression like night owl, Samer one
bed 9:00 wakes 4:00. attended many meetings Samer,
can tell party animal. talk that. mean, talk
fact partier, 2:00 dancing various meetings,
seen. - Yep. - actually good dancer told,
stay late, whatever reason; take
midnight trip hospital, unfortunate reason,
presence people don't see often go really nice night
town get sleep around 2:30 3:00 morning.
one get back schedule? force get view light
normal time get view light? allow sleep in?
optimal protocol? - allow sleep in, remember
long-term effect. something live long period.
remember told experiments mood, required two
weeks light schedule cause mood disturbances. don't happen just
single day. - way justify staying late every while. - Well,
meetings seen in, done five six days continuously,
didn't see came back home, took two weeks
jet lag. really suffer two weeks six crazy night staying
night, drinking wrong time day. not completely okay it.
go back, everything goes back. takes actually literally two weeks recover
circadian rhythm meeting seen partying point. -
kind ironic circadian rhythm- - know. - Meaning people totally
disrupting circadian cycle, scientists human beings too. - Right, think


little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

little occasions, think not worry much will
lasting impact. good news readjust schedule, come
back it. problem maintain wrong schedule prolonged time
becomes chronic, prolonged periods time, problems
accumulation problems. sleeping problem,
produce metabolic problem. metabolic problems, produce lack
exercise. see things can spiral quickly.
hard come back it. - Well, certainly sleep disruption symptom and- -
Yes. - cause almost all- - Absolutely. - Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. -
certainly metabolic syndromes people talking nowadays this,
funnels back light. remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. -
devices, use phone use computer. think
mere dimming screen not interacting screens, say 90 minutes two
hours bedtime, according saying today, profound
effect factors. - does. really believe does. And, again, think
Pat inventions get pouch put phone
pouch. - Mm hm, so, Samer's referring friend, Pat, former Seal Team
member, also impressive person landscape business family, et
cetera. real superhuman regard habit taking phone putting
sealed pouch evening. - Yeah. - basically walled off- -
program sends actually sealed pouches. think great idea
not will take away light you, also take away distraction
want repair recover, sleep that.
phone dinging time, light flashing it,

01:37:50 Samer Got Study Light

just not getting enough sleep causing major problems. -
never asked this, realized now long ago, ask now.
get stuff? - Yeah, mean, honestly, first all, wanted
study genetics knew wanted PhD genetics. got accepted
one university time. joined Learning Memory Lab. liked
learning memory beginning, worked snails Aplysia californica,
started looking learning memory. lab looking daily


variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep

depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light

will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like

Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like

Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.

go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not

blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

variation. really struck. Like never think outside science. really
struck organisms can measure day biologically. shocking me.
just really got attracted wanted see happen?
effect different times day? just stuck it. just, mind blowing
medical school, never heard before. know, really
amazing medicine, think still now good looking stuff spatially,
bad looking temporal aspects. always like see images, static
images, spatial information. - Right, take x-ray, measure temperature- - Yeah,
exactly. - Measure blood pressure. - don't think temporal. talk
John Hogenesch right now, telling importance chronomedicine
chromo pharma... Whatever word is. really just getting drugs right
time day going essential

01:39:33 Clock Gene mRNAs & Accurate Biomarkers

health. - think going come using better trackers, like Oura
rings, WHOOP straps, kinds things? - love trackers, think even
exciting discoveries. Now take single blood sample measure
many biological components figure circadian clock. Something
hard before. marker know
clock, actually understand effect everything; exercise, feeding,
light input. - marker? - papers name?
Phyllis Zee Achim Kramer measure multiple RNAs known
tell phase clock is, multiple proteins biological reactions.
depending combination factors, not single factor, tell
circadian clock. instead just measuring temperature melatonin,
just one measurement. melatonin specifically, also complicated fact
melatonin affected light. temperature, temperature sleep can
easily dissociable, right? travel different timezone, sleep
different times temperature cycle. multiple components measured will
give better determination circadian phase, understanding
circadian phase humans will telling effect giving certain drugs
certain times circadian phase. So, future, going studied



01:41:08 Light Medicine

much higher level can determine phase relation
stuff. - striking animals, besides humans, deviate much
appropriate exposure light light-dark cycle, essentially don't mate
and/or die and/or get killed off. humans, able override least
extent, ways suffer appear things like obesity, metabolic
syndromes, reproductive syndromes accompany syndromes,
know, endocrine syndromes, mood depressive disorders. effort
level nationally laboratories aware try use light order
improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps

improve mood mental health? - mean, honestly, mantra.
thing think people, say, don't take pill, take photon. not, mean,
take pills. important. just making really opportunity right
now incredible advances LED lights, changing spectrum light,
regulating intensities. just simple changes, really improve sleep-wake
cycle, productivity, still actually get done talked
about, messed up, now sleep more, sleep
fragmented. not good. - can't focus sit down- -
can't focus don't alertness need alertness.
allow even actually

01:42:48 ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)

end less. exciting part it. - One questions get asked
often ADHD. think lot self-prescribed well
clinically prescribed ADHD. People tremendously difficult time focusing
not just sleepy, just can't seem anchor attention.
multiple reasons this, now several clinical trials ongoing using
light try anchor people's attention mood wellbeing sake focus.
think love saying mentioned, "Take photon, not pill."
due respect need pharmacology certain people, think
people just haven't really dialed relationship light way allows
rule whether not need medication. - Absolutely, absolutely.



01:43:35 Beat Jetlag: Light, Temperature, Eating

best way put it. can't add that. - talk jet lag. - Mm hm. -
not context of, okay, somebody's traveling Europe Japan east
coast, varies tremendously, right? mean, many different
variations travel individuals roles- - Right. - jobs, et
cetera. rather, talk two three things people can
adjust schedule quickly? Yesterday, called said, "Look, know somebody
traveling six hours. won't even mention direction, 'cause don't want
people anchor example. described simple tools viewing
light little bit earlier normal getting local food schedule, et cetera,
allow shift quickly. - Exactly. - reason want
conversation yes, travelers, shift workers, mostly
fact proven people disrupted circadian
behavior home. So, aside already talked about, can one adjust
quickly new schedule? Like say, fall classes starting, start new job
baby puppy whatever, best way shift clock quickly?
- So, simple talked yesterday. imagine outside no
industrial light. body thinks early evening see bright light,
tell you? Oh, wait, not early evening yet. still early afternoon late
afternoon. delay clock go back late afternoon. get light
early evening, delays clock. that- - Meaning makes
want go sleep later? - Yes, delays clock. So, New York, right?
People Italy advanced clock six hours ahead us.
New York get light early evening, delay even
Italy. now delaying away Italy. Now thing happens. say,
thought dawn came thought already dawn, say three
o'clock morning four o'clock morning. get bright light
say, "Oh, wait minute. Dawn not yet." advance clock.
night, getting bright lights, run dawn already up.
later night, later night, actually just happens humans
get temperature nadir later night, low temperature body. that, lights
start advancing clock. want go Italy, instead getting light early
evening, want get light temperature low. advance


clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions

energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter
Instagram. - Right. - So, Twitter handle? - @SamerHattar. - will
provide link show notes. - Yes, Twitter @SamerHattar, think
Instagram. Yeah, actually. - Samer coaxed onto Instagram,
post time time, mostly pictures food incredibly spicy, also
information chronobiology. comes Instagram Live every
me. So, definitely give follow Twitter. sure
happy answer questions entertain discussions
chronobiology. - Absolutely, yeah. light, yeah.

clock even go Italy, catching Italians just using
light. simple that. - Great. - every region.
calculate much advanced you. know much light
shifts happen per day, can calculate need do, simple math,
adjust either direction delaying going New York California, want
delay clock advancing going New York Italy. - So, order
make visual lot people listening this, not looking
video, will put zero cost downloadable figure HubermanLab.com
website related episode. think can summarize language well.
understand correctly, saying typical wake time say, 7:00 a.m.,
low point temperature probably occurs somewhere around 5:00 a.m.. -
Yeah. - view light right around going essentially advance
clock. - Yeah. body thinks, oh, seven o'clock, advanced
clock one two hours. - view light, say 3:00 a.m.,
probably delay clock? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, so, say land new
schedule. want adjust new schedule. say didn't manage anything
light viewing went. didn't anticipate trip. Suddenly new
schedule, okay? told one ways help shift clock avoid
gastrointestinal issues eat local schedule. - Mm hm. - start basically
behaving like local. - Mm hm. - Even though circadian clock will take little bit
time catch up. - Right, absolutely. remember light, right? So, now
explained simply, take simple example, right? New York
Italy, simple example. New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
say fly New York night. reach Italy eight o'clock morning.
time New York time although you- - Six hours back. - Six hours back.
- 2:00 morning. - 2:00 a.m.. land Italy, want avoid light
like plague. Yeah, eat, really don't want get light. - Right,
'cause otherwise going delay you. - going delay you, going send
California instead sending Italy. - Right, key point.
anyone's confused this, will put diagrams up. Samer saying
crucial. Just getting bright light eyes early day really
beneficial home, travel new time zone, take
account body thinks. Excuse me, take account
body thinks are. - Exactly. - looking Italian sunrise,


just flown New York Italy didn't prepare trip waking
little bit earlier anticipation- - Multiple days, yeah. - view light 6:00 7:00
a.m. Italian time, beautiful Italian sunrise, going delay clock. going
basically throw back California, Italy. going throw
biology back California going middle Italian
night. going miserable- - Miserable. - tell brief anecdote 'cause
called Samer desperation. years ago, traveled Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi
give seminar, 12 hours phase. 12 hour flip. thought just
muscle it. thought get up, just view sunlight sun comes fell apart
mentally physically. Samer came rescue. called him, said, "I don't
know do." said, "Go gym local dawn, workout, eat
view sunlight starting next day." basically got schedule. used
food exercise adjust light viewing activity just completely
whack. - Yeah, mean, talked details, calculate
it, absolutely right. mean, important avoid getting wrong light
information trying

01:50:44 Vigor: Consequence Proper Timing

adjust body otherwise shifts cycle, absolutely right. -
Well, one people vigor. one things
known years, tremendous capacity work
soccer, arguing, respectful arguing. sometimes, know- - getting
worse age. - Yeah, well, talk offline, think lot
vigor lot ability work hard focus really many things
impressive level think issues think
going optimal focus, going optimal exercise,
key. - Right. - think lot people live landscape feeling
like something broken inside can't focus- - subconscious.
- get too- - subconscious, right? Remember subconscious.
effects and, Andrew, absolutely right. Now, honestly, joking aside age,
really agree think part reason continuing able this,
really think it. make sure keep everything aligned.
actually helps lot. Like don't suffer sleep. don't suffer waking up. never use


timer wake up. mean, people say, aren't scared? Like give
lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just

lecture 8:00 7:30. Honestly, like, no way going go beyond that.
just, even try, can't sleep beyond 6:00 a.m. regular times, just, not
going happen.

01:52:15 Waking Middle Night: Nightly Sleep Becomes Nap

4:30 eyes wide awake bed. just system aligned, works. -
lot times people will say, come go sleep, fall asleep fine, wake
3:00 4:00 morning can't fall back asleep. possible
people supposed go bed 8:00 p.m.? - possible. mean, possible.
also possible sometimes people will wake go back sleep. yeah,
mean, possible. possible clock completely misaligned,
getting maybe nap time night supposed... possibly
feel sleepy day. So, possible combination. - Well,
interesting idea hadn't considered. So, think sleep, body
whack light-dark cycle, actually nap. - nap. weaker
part sleep. mean, see traveled different time zone
adjust. go sleep really well, two hours later, fully up. Two hours.
tired regular sleep, no way going wake
two hours. So, feel sleepy later day something like that.
depends whole system aligned environment. -
interesting idea. think going resonate lot people. wake every
morning around 3:00 4:00, generally use bathroom fall back asleep
deeply. doesn't seem disrupt daytime wakefulness. think lot
people obsess waking worry something wrong. - Absolutely. -
Provided can go back sleep okay. - Exactly. can go use bathroom,
go back sleep, not problem. Maybe people, go
use bathroom, use bright light get alerting signal. So,
maybe simple that, affects you. Maybe wake up, put
tons light start reading iPad. combination still
don't know

01:54:10 Melatonin, Pineal Calcification



affecting sleep-wake rhythms sleep maintenance. -
take melatonin? - don't need honest. case, no reason use
guarantee maybe eight o'clock, melatonin already
started go up. time sleep, melatonin high don't use
lot lights sunset. - light inhibits melatonin release. - light really blocks
melatonin level. - hear myth pineal gland calcifies get older.
know anything that? - mean, heard that, don't know... mean,
not clear evidence affects sleep. don't know much it,
honest. - Yeah, evidence seen yes, calcification around
pineal, just sits brain. close bony structures. -
see. - don't think evidence negative effects. - mean,
still have, measure melatonin tell any,
easy thing do. - Yeah, think internet wellness thing got outside
cage. - possible. think absolutely right. - Yeah, sounds terrible,
calcification

01:55:25 Seasonal Rhythms: Mood, Depression, Lethargy & Reproduction

thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. Like heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. talk
seasonality little bit. learned, don't know still true,
suicides occur April, spring. think poem says, "April
cruelest month," think poem begins. data suicides
frequent particular times year? so, spring time year? - Yeah,
lot people talk this. one hypothesis winter month
bad mood, make people not wanting anything. get deep
level depression sun comes up, get actually energy act
depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.

depression, sounds really terrible. just terrible. - Sounds just terrible.
terrible. - idea lack light throughout winter caused
go depression don't feel like anything. light
comes rigor spring, gives depression suffered,
gives push take sad, final act guess. - seasonal effects
demonstrated humans? - Yeah, mean, think humans, not
clear don't think seasonality, start thinking us, think


go major seasonal changes. really do. think eating pattern changed
across year. tell thinking this, clear changes
happens across year. animals, really essential
animals time mating behavior deliver progeny
abundant amount food artificial light causing major disruption.
change way animals receiving light information,
either start mating much earlier much later numbers dwindle. get
dangers really completely getting eliminated extinct. - Well, human birth
rates definitely going down. - Right, some- - mean, US particular, yeah. -
areas, not others. - Not others, right. effects seasonality
humans aware of? - Honestly, see perfectly, think,
Scandinavia, mean, talk people live in- - Sure, get seasonal
depression. - Well, seasonal depression one, actually start asking
questions, tell like winter barely wake up. barely
energy, even depression. Even people don't get seasonal depression,
will tell energy level lower. ability go work not same.
summer, people actually sleep little. tell you, really can feel like
manic, energy not negative way, funny way, right?
mean, want sleep, put curtain. think situations,
really appreciate seasonality humans. think kind destroyed
seasonality don't get exposed much natural light.
artificial light, think honestly, one thing going happen follow
recommendations giving light time, giving food, giving exercise- -
Wait, clear, recommendations. - Well, mean- - No, mean just
fair attribution. - saying going cause also experience
changes across season,

01:59:08 Daylight Savings: Much Worse Might Seem

now going see sun differently. going go
morning summer, going get much brighter... don't like
change time. know people think, oh, biased, 'cause think- - Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Sorry, change time, talking daylight savings? -
Daylight savings. bad idea disrupts rhythm having.


'Cause think body, keep rhythm, will see whole seasonality.
look different aspect people. people say biased
morning person, may true, situation- - Secret conspiracy
morning people. - Yeah, think it, Andrew, situation
getting light perfectly well sudden delayed one
hour because... even though summer, body now, still not
adjusting think, "Oh wait, happened? kind happened?" - Well, glad
bringing always thought big deal, one hour? Right,
one hour shift. Spring forward, fall back. - hard adjust one hour actually. -
goes back beginning discussion. not just one hour. - Right. -
one hour across one day. - Right. - cumulative effect
clock three elements tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. - Right,
homeostatic, sleep light, direct effects mood. - Exactly close,
sometimes hard figure adjust perfectly already sleep
deprived society. shift by... just, accumulates
no benefit. - Well, work major government organization, National Institute
Mental Health. - Yeah. - don't campaign for- - Honestly, no idea. mean,
makes no sense. - No, saying don't go campaign? - Yeah, love to.
mean, makes no sense summer light goes 9:00 p.m., light goes
live Baltimore 9:00 p.m. sudden, really
want see light longer day, now shift way. now goes
sudden 6:00 p.m.. drastic changes? Let blend across
whole season, know? Yes, later, earlier night, least consistent. goes
consistent manner. just don't understand this. makes no sense. -
Well, think reason don't understand biology. -
Exactly, absolutely. - one hour seems trivial unless understand- - not. -
repercussions one hour shift, also clear now based
saying, one hour shift taking alignment natural
light-dark cycle exactly wrong direction. - pushing people get even later. -
Yeah. - summer, light going push later anyway. doesn't make
sense. put beautifully, just rambled really- - No, no, made clear.
- mean, like literally made people problem advanced
sleep rhythm delayed, now give hour make even
delayed. push even later day-night cycle. just doesn't make


sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
thinking this, said, write book. write book
call "The Tripartite Model." think put components together,
interesting point. - write book. probably
try change title like, "Food, Mood You," something. can put
little print Tripartite Model whatever, regardless called,
absolutely write book. like Samer write book, like
learn him, talk little bit people can find you.
laboratory National Institutes Mental Health. Head Chronobiology
Unit, things mentioned earlier, active Twitter

sense all. - think 2022 year abolish daylight savings. - Oh,
man. day honestly. - Well, also, positive effect
essentially epidemic mental health issues issues related
improper interactions light, think well worthwhile cause, can
explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. - [Andrew] going fight
another group. - Common, that. - [Andrew] common battle
opposed one another. - mean, circadian people honestly, give
credit, trying years abolish daylight saving. - Yeah, problem
go sleep 9:00 p.m. wake 4:00 a.m., never see them. -
right, right. - No, circadian community done amazing job figuring
need. - Right. - challenge course, making sure people
get need. - Right. - making sure societal level, not vaulting
wrong direction. - biggest problem late waking
people, think really, going try put better way now, think,
oh, morning person, want see sun early. want
suffer dropping late, not case. happens shift
back daylight saving, now going make suffer really badly
now going earlier. - Right, fall. - fall not
enough light. - Yeah, right. - keep way. try convince
actually end causes trouble need light
late schedule fall, shift back. say, keep daylight saving
time. proven bad. Like people done studies
literally two areas close others areas whole year daylight
saving much problems even cancer rates depression. don't
want that. trying convince people need prevent
switch, don't need daylight saving all. problem happens. -
Interesting. not thought that, yes, late risers fall,
fall back, say, spring forward, fall back, dial back clock, really
compounding problem already exists. - Exactly. really nice think,
keep consistent spring, get equinox day starts going
up, even summer start going down, fall get
equinox go back. symmetrical, right? goes short day, longer, long,
long, long, long, short day again. now getting bumps
sides spring fall. that? Something beautifully


symmetrical, beautifully smooth, putting bumps it. - Well, not just
beautiful there, evolved. mean, essentially system- -
natural. - evolved hundreds thousands years. - seasonality.
even apart exact equator,

02:05:27 Eye Color & Sensitivity Light, Bipolar Disorder

every part earth seasonality. - want briefly touch something
individual genetic variation sensitivity light. - Yeah. - not chronotype,
first all, basic question. people light eyes, light colored eyes,
sensitive light people darker pigmented eyes? - mean, honestly,
makes sense will think dark pupil, blocking
light. So, light pupil, yes, vision, may not obvious,
something measuring amount light, getting light me.
probably need less light effective somebody darker.
maybe explain sometimes lighter people say, don't want go
bright conditions really bright. - Yeah, can't even cafe one
reflective tables, like metal table. - Right. - Unless dark sunglasses
on. - Exactly. - bright painful me. - Right, right. - Whereas people like
you, sat outside meals like fine. assumed kind
Jordanian toughness versus- - No, no, no, really pupil blocks light.
think possible simple pupil blocking light can sensitivity,
question also goes deeper. sensitivity differences?
understanding think may be, depends effective cells
responding light, healthy ipRCGs are. not many studies
show that. really clear happening patients bipolar, seem
different sensitivities light. seems least people
psychological changes, may differences sensitivity light, so. -
differences particular direction? - don't remember exact data. - can
look up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - people heard say nauseum
point actually roll eyes, two pieces brain,
pointing eyes, folks, outside cranial vault. - Absolutely. -
two pieces brain basically inform brain whether not alert
asleep. - Absolutely. - can imagine two little pieces brain


call eyes genetic variations. - Right. - course eye color genetically
determined, genetic variations based whether not
ancestry evolved near equator equator, right? mean, see
blue eyes Scandinavia, equator. - Absolutely, mean,
lack light said need less inhibition not enough light, right?
idea changing color. So, yeah, totally agree you. mean, think
area will studied later will empirically determined. problem
field right now, think biggest problem, don't
way measure ipRCGs sensitivities humans. still like, easy measure
rod cone function go optometrist, measure details, right?
Contrast detection. - look chart, get Snellen Chart. - Yeah,
exactly. - look letters DMV. - Yeah. - Yeah. - non
subconscious, still don't good measuring systems figure
Andrew's sensitivity? Samer's sensitivity? person's sensitivity?
think starting work something like hopefully develop techniques.
till develop them, going hard figure sensitivity
difference? relate? men woman? Dark light? that,
normal versus psychologically affect, stuff like that. - Fascinating. every time
talk, learn much.

02:09:28 Spicy Food, Genetic Variations Sensory Sensitivity

best way, best sense term, waterfall knowledge. final
question, question sensitivity whole kind,
sensitivity spicy food. Now, reason asking question, seemingly
blue made mistake Samer cook me. said, "Not
spicy." said, "Okay, not spicy." actually said, "Okay, not spicy."
almost killed me. Like like two three days. know lot
biology outside visual system, light, et cetera. around while.
known genetic inherited kind sensitivities spicy food? things like red
peppers capsaicin? call mild, friend, almost put
hospital. - think similar swimming ocean need go develop
pain tolerance it. - Okay, true, true, like cold water swims Samer's not
fan. - Yeah. - going change. adaptable. - adaptable. -


going change. - belief. met Rejji, like you. started
eating lot spicy food, lost touch spicy food is. nearly killed you,
Andrew, apologize that. - forgive you. So, basically saying
marriage toughened up? - Toughened up, exactly.

02:10:52 Synthesizing Information, Samer Twitter, Instagram

- [Andrew] Maybe solution. - need, yeah. - Samer,
amazing march importance light, not just regulating sleep
wakefulness, also food timing, interactions mood, interactions
exercise. certain people going start thinking change
relationship light way anchor everything do. important
health. just behalf them, just directly friend
colleague many years now, just want say, thank incredible
work sharing us. - Thank much. actually now
