00:05:00 Emotions: Aligning Mind & Body

vitamin D3K2. give five free travel packs. Today talking
emotions, emotions central entire experience life. Whether not
happy sad depressed angry life experience. yet think
importance placed emotions. people actually understand
emotions arise brain body. mentioned brain body
see today emotions really capture brain body relationship. cannot say
emotions arise just happens head. also involves events, biological
events chemical events within body. thing emotions
no real agreement good emotion bad emotion. Today gonna
talk biology chemicals pathways give rise emotions.
going equip several, not many tools will allow regulate
change steer emotions want, not using typical advice.
know, everyone's probably heard thing. Oh feeling depressed, just smile,
know, impossible depressed smiling. Look, true
wouldn't depressed people depressed people don't want
depressed. not case simply smiling will reverse depression sadness.
simply not case smiling can inhibit sadness. just doesn't work
way. However, case certain things happening body influence
brain functions chemicals released. today gonna talk


lot brain

00:06:41 Nutrients, Neurochemicals Mood

body interact create things called emotions context food
nutrition. reason not beating drum
particular diet regimens anything. fact, not gonna that.
gonna gonna review important scientific data point
ingesting certain nutrients, macro nutrients like proteins, fats,
carbohydrates, well micronutrients can impact chemicals brain give
rise feelings happy sad sleepy alert want sleepy
sleepy want alert. sure broad discussion yet
gonna get specific emotions are, arise body, tools
one can use order better control emotions, tools people can use
believe not feel happier feel calmer. last 20 years
explosion scientific studies exploring brain body interact
support certain neurochemicals give us feelings alert happy
depressed certain life gonna terrible certain life going
great. mysterious might sound confusing might sound
gonna make clear today. gonna come away
conversation lot tools can act immediately. tools
grounded scientific data. gonna provide links several studies,
gonna mention several studies go along. overall, goal today
understand moods emotions arise different pathways
brain body allow happen can use pathways
change emotions tools can rely specific ways shift
being, say, slightly depressed, feeling happier. actually ways
that, feeling alert anxious feeling calmer.

00:08:39 Primitive Expressions Actions

tools distinct tools talked previous episodes.
discussion around emotions long rich history going back Darwin.
even long Darwin, conversation philosophers scientists


hundreds not thousands years. idea Darwin put forth
really attractive last hundred years emotions
universal facial expressions around emotion universal
people capitalized idea. extent true. mean, think
two robust examples see something smell
something taste something like, tend postural leaning
in. tend inhale air time, tend bring whatever chemical
substances is. tend mm's kind lean closer things
attractive us. see experience things don't like sometimes
mild aversion. just kind lean back look away. times intensive
version disgust tend cringe face. tend avoid inhaling
chemicals. probably roots ancient biological mechanisms prevent
us ingesting things bad us, chemical compounds tastes might
poisonous. much foundation discussion emotion center
around kind push pull attraction things aversion things. Now
basic way thinking emotions think it, works lot
different circumstances brain everywhere deep circuits brain
kind call higher order evolved centers brain.
push pull thing either previous episode, talked go, circuits allow
emphasize action no go circuits, circuits basal ganglia
allow de-emphasize action prevent action. talked push
pull. aversion attraction push pull too. Delight happiness excitement
attractions certain things ideas, songs, people, places, foods aversion leaning
out. disgust, avoidance. can break discussion
emotions simpler versions themselves, core attraction
aversion important theme might realize already. people tend
overlook action either moving forward
moving away something. time talking action nervous
system, talking motor behaviors. talking literally
contraction muscles move toward away things. time
talking nerve muscle action, talking brain body,
brain can't move brain body organism can
move. body brain organism, you, can move toward away
things deem good bad you. Now, things


attracted avoid call innate hardwired.
know, taste bitter compounds, not saying bitter like little bit
bitters drink something like that, really bitter compounds. tend avoid
associated poisons. taste things sweet
savory tend pursue those. tend lean toward
speak tend not avoid them. circuits brain aversion
attraction toward things.

00:12:30 Vagus Nerve: Truth, Fiction, Function

body governing lot that. immediately conversation want
raise important point nerve pathway many, many people
heard gets discussed time. one kind oversold
wrong reasons undersold, unfortunately, real power, vagus
nerve. vagus nerve one, not only, one way brain body
connected regulates emotional states. Now, many probably
heard polyvagal theory. gonna talk today. Polyvagal theory
popularized Stephen Porges interesting theory, certain aspects it,
frankly, hold science, doesn't. gonna discuss
today. lot vagus excitement vagus, V-A-G-U-S,
somehow got mind public vagus involved calming us down.
vagus nerve? Okay, gonna make really simple, particular
just listening, can just imagine this, watching point
various areas, basically vagus 10th cranial nerve basically means
neurons, control center neurons vagus lives just kind
near neck, right? branch vagus goes brain. send little
wire brain. branch goes periphery not just gut. goes
stomach, intestines heart, lungs, immune system.
vagus nerve incredible taking information body two
directions. first call sensory. sensing things happening
gut lungs, everything, example, lungs lungs distended,
vagus nerve senses sends information brain. also
consents things gut like distended empty stomach happens be,
can sense heart rate. can sense immune system, whether not


bacteria things invading body. sends information brain.
two-way street sensory information going brain.
vagus. like super highway sensory information going one way
direction motor control. vagus not just sensing things. actually
controlling things. got sensory pathway motor pathway. first
thing think everyone know vagus. fact, important feel
like important people knowing walking involves flexors extensors.
don't think important, important walking, frankly,
vagus way can govern brain body connection.
can steer various aspects mood wellbeing, people just don't
understand use it. first got understand is. got sensory
information coming different organs body brain. got
motor information going brain back body. got super
highway within you. Now actually regulates vagus. Oftentimes hear things
like, oh particular behavior

00:15:45 “Vagus Stimulation”: Terrible Concept

rubbing face particular location breathing particular way, warm bath
something stimulates vagus. Well, right now, want everyone know that, quote
unquote, stimulating vagus broadly speaking terrible way think
vagus know what, contaminant inside body vagus
senses projects information brain, start generate fever
start try kill contaminant body. don't know want
stimulate vagus just general theme today, going get specific
can activate particular circuits, certain pathways certain organs brain
order feel better relieve certain conditions. certainly don't want just
stimulate vagus.

00:16:35 Polyvagal Theory

Now excitement vagus part quite honestly, fairly
pioneering theory vagus polyvagal theory. polyvagal, word
poly means many, cool acknowledges vagus lot different


branches. not just one thing. really liked that. liked naming polyvagal.
idea Porges put forward dorsal vagus, kind
runs back spinal cord, involved alertness activation kind
fight flight type stuff. ventral pathway involved
kind empathic behaviors. not quite agreement modern
anatomy, best time. So, okay. problem
polyvagal theory way discussed people often say, oh
dorsal vagus active tend someone little keyed
people kind state freeze kind flacid kind like just not really
active just lethargic. Well, pathway hypoactive.
active. lot theories psychology maps onto vagus.
far know, don't map real physiology. Now, problem kind
way polyvagal theory discussed probably not real experts,
lot people people start diagnose different psychological physical
manifestations vagus. say things like, Oh person hyper
flexible joints therefore dorsal vagus isn't active enough something like
that. really kind gone way outside lane lines. today gonna clean
lot that. make really simple

00:18:27 Vagus Senses Many Things, & Moves Organs

vagus actually works. least understand today 2021. First
all, mentioned, sensory information way detect light
eyes hear sounds ears, sensors gut sense
full empty gut is. can also sense acidic gut is. can sense
various things within gut. heart same. informing brain
fast heart beating, full lungs communicated
status immune system. way think vagus way
think eyes. eyes looking colors, looking motion
looking bright is. one things, features telling
brain something different. brain can decide awake asleep whether
not looking somebody's attractive unattractive. vagus nerve also
analyzing many features within body informing brain feel
do. really good example think exciting one relates


sugar. know sweet things generally tastes good.

00:19:35 Sugar Sensing Without Perception Sweetness

not particularly fan sweet things. know, much rather cheese
pizza hamburger steak. like savory fatty foods, like sweet foods.
people find sweet foods attractive. want them, might might not
able regulate behavior around them, want them. really
interesting hundreds years people thought
way sweet foods taste. makes sense, right? eat something tastes
sweet. want it. Well, turns much interesting that.
eat something sweet within stomach, cells, neurons,
sense presence sugary foods independent taste signal brain.
sensors, neurons send information vagus brain goes
series stations. release dopamine. molecule makes
want whatever just ingested. fact, pathway
powerful done experiments completely numb taste
feeling somebody's mouth blindfolded. don't know eating
eating food. either sugary not sugary. find
even though people can't taste sugary food crave food contains
sugar sensors gut, sense sugar. put differently,
actually sensors within body make crave sugar independent
sweet taste things. Now incredible. does, tells us
circuits body driving us towards certain behaviors
making us feel good even though can't perceive them. Now,
really interested gut intuition kind gut feelings gut feeling except
chemical gut feeling. particular set neurons detecting something
body particular feature, case presence sugars, sending
information brain essentially control behavior. find remarkable,
means call attractive isn't always coming
thoughts feelings, even perception. drawn particular
foods drawn perhaps also particular people, places things
information coming body. gonna talk
one can information. know many people thoughtful concerned


sugars days thinking ingest much sugar. sugar snuck
things eat. indeed, true. mean, completely reframe way
think sort so-called hidden sugars foods. means
even food savory like piece pizza piece bread even like salad
dressing sugar snuck can't taste will still crave
thing without knowing crave sugar. words,
might find wanting certain foods not knowing want foods.
find fascinating aspect biology yes, relates mood
emotion. talk moment.

00:23:00 Eating-Induced Anxiety

just back bit ask question eat certain things?
certain foods make us feel good? foods actually make us feel anxious.
think people may familiar this. people might not, people
don't realize approach eating anxiety associated that.
alertness. Remember previous discussions, even don't haven't
seen those, moods feelings wellbeing anchored continuum
alertness versus calmness. hear often rest digest. know
that, oh, eat, feel really nice full, hopefully comfortably full not
full. relaxing. feel satiated, associated serotonin molecule
satiation. true. people don't know area
hypothalamus. deepen brain kind middle deep portion brain called
lateral hypothalamus. lateral hypothalamus really interesting
controls feeding, inhibits feeding. stops us feeding. another area
brain. want names, give you. don't want names, just ignore
them, delete memory awareness, called locus coeruleus, now
locus coeruleus sits back brainstem releases norepinephrine
essentially adrenaline. makes us feel alert. Now, locus coeruleus lot
different functions brain, going eat say walk
restaurant, sit preparing meal, locus coeruleus known release
noradrenaline brain. creating kind alertness. ancient utility,
creating alertness. many people, experience approach food
stress anxiety. interesting approach food locus coeruleus


releasing molecules make us feel anxious alert sometimes
felt excitement. asks probably feel food generally,
happy relationship food? trying restrict relationship
food, people coming dinner, will play course,
certain stress anxiety upon approach food. approach food feel
anxiety locus coeruleus activates lateral hypothalamus way inhibits
feeding makes us not want eat. lot people kind pre-meal
anxiety anxiety around food can't seem just calm good
meal access later rest digest. lot heightened
stress upon approach food lot tools there, eating
disorders just kind general public isn't suffering eating disorders,
things like mindfulness around meals. know, always tell never
eat stressed. sorry, life not organized way can that.
never eat. Right eat awake don't know stressed,
don't think tend run around lot day. don't generally take
time two three deep breaths eat. generally will just eat. can
healthy unhealthy depending quality digestion. think using digestion
guide good, lot people aren't aware interaction locus
coeruleus lateral hypothalamus basic mechanism supposed
get little bit alert anxious around mealtime. eat, mechanisms
calming satiation supposed kick mechanisms involve
mentioned earlier, two things. One things taste, digestion starts mouth.
course, taste food. Everyone tells us chew food more. Yes,
can improve digestion. not supposed drink many fluids eat.
true too, lot feel eat eat vagus
sensing gut. sending information time. sugar?
fats? contaminants? lot information. so-called
parallel pathways going brain regulate whether not want
eat something not. accelerators, things make us want
eat more, like sugar fats nutrient dense. helps
generally, least short term

00:27:30 Eat Brain Perceives “Amino Acid Threshold”



support survival animals, also amino acids. important.
lot data, much comes data people eat
much eat subconscious detection many amino acids
array, meaning constellation amino acids given food. fair say
sum total studies pointing direction people will basically eat, not
stomach full brain perceives adequate intake
amino acids. Now, conversation comes context know,
meat, keto, kind zone diet, Mediterranean diet, vegan diet.
largely going ignore kind strict camps today. will talk little bit it,
think one actually taps something important brain
body relationship ones don't. don't want get discussion
ethics different foods animal based non animal based. 'Cause not
topic today. really nutrient sensing amino acid sensing. generally
will eat gut tells brain adequate amounts amino acids.
Amino acids course important building blocks sure,
muscle, things body need repair. people don't
realize amino acids neurochemicals brain made from.
Now, vitally important. Okay, heard dopamine molecule
makes feel good. Actually dopamine molecule makes feel good.
released within brain. feel good dopamine release,
dopamine releases caused surprise, excitement, events looking forward
turnout well, inhibited events looking forward don't work
someone says going call really really excited talk to,
don't, thought movie gonna really great not,
expect meal really delicious. kind of, eh, actually

00:29:45 Reward Prediction Error: Buildup, Letdown Wanting

name that. called reward prediction error. can actually use
context meals plans way useful people
know, essentially expect something really terrific really place higher
expectation chemical level. don't get much dopamine
expecting something, hear really great restaurant place
really, case, have, wouldn't call addiction. call


affliction croissants. best vegetable course, croissant. get really
excited fact someone will tell me, oh place
incredible croissants. gotta go there. get really excited, go. just
telling gonna really terrific raises expectation, dopamine
expectation. unless croissants amazing chances going
experience less good, less satisfying. will truly release less dopamine
just said, oh yeah, think croissants street.
just tried one random, reward prediction error
expectation something releases dopamine actual event releases dopamine.
event related dopamine not exceed expectation least match it,
much higher tendency won't pursue thing again. dopamine
really powerful not just molecule reward. molecule desire.
molecule wanting not just molecule having. book, since people often
ask book recommendations. don't know author personally, love book.
called "The Molecule More". terrific book. wish written it, frankly,
want learn dopamine reward prediction error dopamine
regulates various aspects emotional motivational life, terrific read.
Dopamine going lead us want eat something not want
something, dopamine really craving. motivation
desire. mentioned, amino acid sensors gut detecting
many amino acids

00:32:01 L-Tyrosine, Dopamine, Motivation, Mood, & Movement

also detecting amino acids. particular amino acid called
L-tyrosine comes food. can look online, foods contain L-
tyrosine. meats. nuts. also plant-based foods. L-tyrosine
precursor couple molecules like L-DOPA, et cetera, make dopamine.
misconception serotonin gut.
dopamine gut. therefore mood gut. not quite way
works. Okay. talk serotonin moment dopamine synthesized
amino acids eat. However, dopamine neurons give rise
feelings good wanting desire motivation, reside brain.
don't want get confused. want respect honor power gut


vagal pathway, really neurons within brain drive pursuit
decision-making, mean? Well, people make little dopamine.
people make little dopamine need prescription dopamine. need
L-DOPA, people Parkinson's take L-DOPA compounds increase
dopamine Parkinson's associated deficits movement, starts
tremor, actually starts things interesting. talk
moment, Parkinson's depression. blunting motivation mood
effect, tremor. eventually severe conditions challenges
speaking walking famous examples Muhammad Ali, Michael
J. Fox, great boxing trainer, Freddie Roach, like people Parkinson's
least later life challenges speaking. Now not just fighters
develop Parkinson's far know, Michael J. Fox wasn't fighter. People can
develop Parkinson's Parkinson's depletion dopamine neurons brain.
not just movement challenges.

00:34:04 Supplementing L-Tyrosine, Drugs Abuse, Wellbutrin

challenges mood. Now, hopefully don't Parkinson's,
clear dietary L-tyrosine supports healthy production things like
dopamine well factors within brain. Now, people immediately
ask, well supplement L-tyrosine? just talk
gonna come up. Full disclosure, sometimes take L-tyrosine. not taking right now,
take occasionally, can buy capsule form. increase kind
mood elevation alertness. counter. check
doctor. not responsible healthcare not doctor, whether not
safe you, people preexisting hyper dopaminergic conditions like mania
probably not take L-tyrosine. thing taking L-tyrosine crash,
okay? not massive crash take appropriate doses right
can produce crash lethargy kind brain fog next day so.
L-tyrosine however can ingested foods supplementation
increase dopamine levels. well-known, taken chronically however, can disrupt
dopamine pathways. Now drugs will increase L-tyrosine
dopamine well. severe enough generally tend
addictive properties. things like methamphetamine, things like cocaine terrible


really ramp dopamine system much people really can't
achieve dopamine release mechanisms. food ingestion
L-tyrosine profound effect levels dopamine. takes little
really will impact level mood. Certain antidepressants fall category
dopaminergic antidepressants. One famous ones course Wellbutrin.
Wellbutrin developed lot antidepressants tend make
people feel kind lethargic side effect profiles people didn't like.
developed thing that, generic name different, generally called
Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin activates dopamine epinephrin, substrate
dopamine. involved motivation alertness effort.
might say, wow, sounds like great drug. However, drug, side effect profile
tends things associated elevated mood alertness. isn't
like taking L-tyrosine. isn't like eating tyrosine rich foods. really
much greater release dopamine epinephrin, increases things like anxiety,
sweating, pupils dilate. certain effects on, particular people epilepsy,
used somewhat successfully smoking cessation, again, not
everybody not encourage use things. just describing
biology rationale drugs developed. back
second. just kind take stock at. brain body connection.
many them, one main ones vagus nerve. vagus
collects information lot things, breathing, heart rate stuff happening
gut, et cetera, gut way, includes stomach intestines, sends
information brain. brain using information decide one two
things, move toward something move away. can also pause, essentially pausing
not moving toward. dopamine pathway foods rich L-tyrosine
generally give us elevated mood make us want whatever
happen well things, motivation, generalizes things
not unique just ingesting foods foods give us big pulse dopamine will
make us crave food. will make us crave activity led
ingestion food. mentioned earlier, lot happening
subconscious level not even aware of. think concern
hidden sugars ingestion sugars serious not just
sugars impacting blood glucose negative ways. Although often is, not just
obesity crisis happening. also fact disrupting dopamine

00:38:29 Serotonin: Gut, Brain, Satiety Prozac

neurochemicals subconsciously. like talk
pathways brain body regulate moods emotions also
actionable. neuromodulator really interesting context
vagus serotonin. Serotonin, just remind neuromodulator therefore creates
bias neural circuits neurons brain body going active
makes less likely ones going active. think fair say
without ever measured bulldog Costello, just brain body must
swimming serotonin, calm eats lot generally
feels pretty sated. kind animal obsessed comforts. bit
hedonist, serotonin elevated tends make us feel really comfortable
kind blissed wherever are. contrast dopamine epinephrin
mainly put us pursuit things. Motivation pursuit. Serotonin
feeling really comfy are. conversation around brain body relationship
mood serotonin many years was, well, eat big meal. gut
distended. got nutrients need rest digest serotonin
released. sorta true, lot going lot
interesting actionable going on. First all, you, perhaps not
heard 90% serotonin make gut. indeed
lot serotonin gut. neurons gut makes serotonin.
neurons brain make serotonin, deal.
serotonin impacts mood mental state not gut.
neurons brain area called raphae nucleus brain,
locations too, neurons control whether not feel
satiated not. Whether not feel happy calm. can't discussion
serotonin without discussion antidepressants.
late eighties early nineties explosion number prescription
drugs released. Things like first one famous one Prozac, Zoloft
Paxil, number ones so-called SSRI selective serotonin re-uptake


inhibitors. long acronym, basically drugs work preventing
gobbling serotonin re-uptake serotonin neurons released
leads serotonin overall means elevate serotonin. indeed
drugs can useful certain people feel better cases
depression clinical disorders well. really don't want dismiss
useless dangerous everybody. can quite useful many people.
Not everyone responds well sure heard. side effect
profile affects like blunting affect. can make people feel kind flat, kinda meh,
can reduce appetite food. can reduce appetite sex. can sorts things,
can work really well. Sometimes dose-related issue, et cetera. Serotonin
fascinating however, well neurons raphe work impacted
events within gut. Although might surprised find
events are. go little bit deeper gut. again, gut includes
stomach small intestine large intestine ask like, going
serotonin gut? impacting serotonin brain? think
context us might want increase decrease serotonin
levels. far know, aren't really good home blood tests things
like serotonin dopamine. commercial products there. me,
just me, not particularly impressed. know, not getting
hormones levels measured metabolic factors measured, can daunting.
can done rigorously. tests there. even some, believe
not. questionnaires that, think actually last year made
bigger newspapers, dopamine serotonin? that?
find stuff little silly although appreciate, like fact people
thinking talking neuromodulators aren't really great ways
measure things outside clinic. great clinical tools can
get inside hospital proper endocrinologist neurologist, no great at-
home tool. maybe call arms entrepreneurial folks
create tests, accurate tests please, done home.
people feel like anxious always motivated state
trying adjust serotonin. Many people adjust serotonin just eating
food

00:43:38 Eating Promote Dopamine (Daytime) & Serotonin (Night Time)



carbohydrate rich foods will increase serotonin. talked previous
podcast personally big fan least usually fast exercise
early part day eat relatively high protein moderate fat zero carb low carb
meal lunch afternoon stay alert foods tend favor dopamine
production acetylcholine production, epinephrin production alertness. mood
generally pretty good time. evening comes around
concerned sleep good night's sleep, not concerned anxious way,
want get good night's sleep. will ingest foods promote serotonin release
contain lot tryptophan. eat meat, like white
meat, turkey meat. don't tend to, never liked turkey. don't mind animal

00:44:30 Supplementing Serotonin: Sleep, & Caution Sleep Disruptions

don't like ingesting meat, starchy carbohydrates will increase serotonin.
people also will take serotonin. can now buy 5-HTP supplements.
little bit tricky. 5-HTP supplements can course increase 5-HTP. 5-HTP
serotonin sometimes can create problems endogenous self-made
production serotonin. never fan taking things close chemical

00:51:00 Emotional Context Book Recommendation: “How Emotions Made”

going relates emotions. last episode said
something gonna repeat now briefly, much talk


good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman
Podcast. discussions Instagram Live, Northeastern
University, world expert emotions. first book "How Emotions Made"
not book sent me. paid money years ago, bought it, read
it, loved long met Lisa, just delighted got known
little bit. really interesting read psychology emotions
subjectivity emotions. So, whereas talking mainly biology emotions
gets little bit psychology biology well. Lisa's just
terrific. also putting lot information world emotion.
want learn check work, again, Lisa Feldman Barrett.
book "How Emotions Made" Hopefully continue write many
books. now understand relationship hope foods dopamine,
foods serotonin communicated brain via
vagus, right? ingest foods, supplements things people take,
don't put directly brain. put gut. yes, gut
brain connection not serotonin gut makes feel calm
placid. not dopamine gut. just oversold way
think something really attractive. understand idea
certain things experience life emotions happening body.
maybe little control, right? thing hard container.
can't just stuff dopamine there. probably take Mucuna pruriens
bean stuff ear, please don't that. It'd make ear itchy
serotonin outside. can't get stuff there. ingest
things metabolized certain ways communicate brain maybe
pass brain across called blood brain barrier. talk
blood brain barrier minute. actually called BBB. ends


sounding like baby, BBB. guess like BB, anyway, BBB, also nerves
gut sensing nutrient contents food saying, oh,
feel better want more. Oh, got lot bitterness acid taste it.
want less that. transitioned discussion dopamine
serotonin gut hopefully got actionable items belt,
pun intended, can understand certain foods certain nutrients
can look up, might impact mood. somebody really anxious
really wired. Well, dopamine adrenaline pathway epinephrine pathway
probably not one want lean harder. tend someone
pretty passive trouble motivation. Well think ramping
dopamine pathway through, always think behaviors proper food choices
best way start. behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.

can actually say, ingest L-tyrosine high probability going
make dopamine. talking ingesting food

studio slow speech down. uncaffeinated, probably afford
little serotonin life. So, whereas Costello, can afford wake every

ways quantitative can regulate dosages can
regulate amounts can regulate timing. everyone play
things figure right terms feeding. everyone
explore understand safe right them. But, course, exercise


still important. talked social connection last episode super important

link too, study first published 2008 there've many others well.
First all, experiment done animals. found model learned
helplessness animals. not kind animals, put rats mice
jar. let swim swim, swim, swim try save life.
eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially
done humans although didn't swim point near drowning.
took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,
appetite, sorts negative health effects. comparison thousand
milligrams day EPA. EPA one elements contains high levels
omega-3's things like fish oil, talk sources little bit
wasn't thousand milligrams fish oil. thousand milligrams EPA. Compared
20 milligrams Fluoxetine Prozac, okay. Really increases serotonin.
study 60 individuals, again, provide links study. found
equally effective reducing depressive symptoms. imagine that,
food-based compound can't make without, right, not situation
can make omega-3s. get food sources
supplementation, effective 20 milligrams fluoxetine course eight


weeks. really interesting addition combination
thousand milligrams EPA Fluoxetine synergistic effect lowering
depressive symptoms. find remarkable. heard first came
wasn't sure make it. 'Cause lot studies come
generally like focus changes behavior around things large
center mass. lot information. couple years later, fact start taking
thousand milligrams per day EPA fish oil. Now side effects fish
oil. People blood, bleeders Factor V Leiden mutations
women taking birth control, can affect blood clotting things
sort really talk doctor make sure okay you. Fish oil also can give
people fishy breath pretty gross, frankly, now fish oils either
Encapsulations put lemon flavoring
doesn't effect. event, thousand milligrams per day EPA. started
ingesting regularly. just felt better. wasn't clinically depressed, generally,
feel least me, increase mood affect. number things
supposed reduce inflammation. cardiovascular effects controversial long
time everyone thought effects platelets really terrific.
articles came major newspapers saying maybe not much effects
mood really profound. now lots studies.

01:01:00 Fish Oil Antidepressant

go PubMed put EPA fish oil depression find
number really impressive results showing least
effective certain SSRI antidepressants dosages can amplify improve
effect low dosages SSRIs. feel like people
know this. nutrition, profoundly affecting mood depression
terrible, right? Depression can component anxiety cases
people feel lousy uncertain. kind talk depression
anxiety talk someone anxious can tell everything's
gonna okay. always concerned might not know.
don't really know plane isn't gonna crash. don't really know life gonna go
okay. sense, right, no one crystal ball can predict
future, tend perseverate fixate uncertainty. course


versions depression involve certainty. People lethargic
certain say, yeah, certain, never gonna get another job. certain,
never gonna meet anyone new. certain gonna fail. kind divide
sphere depression around certainty uncertainty. interesting
thousand milligrams per day EPA shown relieve forms
depression. Now, mean gonna work everybody? No, not
try play psychiatrist. want point direction manuscripts
can make informed choices yourself. can discuss doctor
family make choices right you. especially
interesting heart effects, heard omega-3s,

01:02:40 EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain

course can get sources too, can get fatty fish,
flax seeds, hemp seeds. number chia seeds, kinds things
levels EPA required quite high. thousand milligrams per day
pretty hard get food although can done depending
eating. interesting heart effects solid really stand
literature lot something talked previous episode.
mention again, heart rate variability. know heart rate
really high heart rate, really low. Neither good. lot people
think, oh just want low heart rate, big stroke volume. know, running
lot may 30 40 beats per minute. great shape still want
heart rate variability. lot tone autonomic nervous system
talked last time. How, inhale, speeds heart rate. exhale,
decreases heart rate. called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. basis
heart rate variability. maybe short post this. can get
mechanism behaviors spill might useful you.
point heart rate variability. HRV good. interesting
study 2009 showed people eat diet fail supplement
way high omega-6 three ratio, not enough omega-3s, not
markers inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 TNF-alpha,
tend non-responders antidepressants. Shifting omega-3 omega-6 ratio
couple things. First all, increasing amount EPA shifted ratio.


higher omega-3 omega-6 ratio, good, lowered inflammation markers,
allowed antidepressants effect, even low doses.
really interesting thing. worked increasing heart rate variability, think, well,
world happen? know mean, ton effects
way works way things impacting gut
autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, said, vagus includes connections
heart signaling sensory information fast heart beating
brain not just stuff lungs, information heart brain
adjusts heart rate heart rate variability. incredible way one
can use gut, ingestion EPA's, either food
supplementation increase rate variability thereby improve symptoms, meaning
reduce symptoms depression, even make low levels antidepressants
wouldn't otherwise work work. think like study much a, super
cool. bridges brain body access. incorporates nutrition micronutrients
brain also really points something hear time,
body whole system. working whole system brain isn't working
isolation skull. reacting things happening body
gut heart rate heart rate variability. things ingest can
profound effect them. Now, course, really want emphasize something
no one compound nutrient supplement drug behavior
matter going end shifting depression improving one's
mood improving sleep. constellation things. especially true
people start get excited supplements drugs kinds potential
various things. Right now, lot excitement psychedelics
therapeutic uses. think great, good friend mine physician
clinician says better living chemistry still requires better living. cannot
expect take compound regardless source potency completely shift
experience life without continue engage proper behaviors,
things know proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.
many others well. still find collection studies omega-3
omega-6 ratios profoundly important much completely changed
way think food, foods eat, supplement. don't necessarily think
everybody really think incredible compounds
robust effects feelings wellbeing.



01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either
food supplementation. acknowledge not everyone wants take fish oil.
couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment
makes not want ingest fish related products. krill oil. Krill still
organism. little tiny thing whales eat lot people generally eat little
of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.
preference. people really like krill oil source omega-3s. mention
sources like chia seeds flax seeds, notice
not things tend ingest lot regular basis. possible get omega-3s
meats. animals grazed grasses contain lot omega-3s.
ingest meat source meat gonna important
relates omega-3s. Even within category fish oil concern
sometimes mercury contaminants. want go brand
emphasizes gone really good sources decontaminate
regardless. search brands. test can


01:09:05 L-Carnitine Mood, Sperm Ovary Quality, Autism, Fibromyalgia,
Migraine

whether not fish oil rancid not. people take liquid form.
people take capsule form. liquid form gonna affordable. capsule
form little easier little portable. can actually just chew one
gel tablets. tastes really fishy kind rancid, know disgusting.
want spit out. doesn't tolerable know okay.
Unfortunately buy first order that. Although, don't know, maybe
can get open bottle store tell want try


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall
around brain barrier brain important.
feature neurons don't recreate injury, like
organs body. not lot turnover cells despite might've
heard. nature created BBB, blood brain barrier make sure
certain molecules particular, large molecules don't get across blood-brain barrier.
'Cause can damaging tissues. Incidentally, also rigid
stringent barrier around organs, gonads. ovaries
testes brain organs body nature gone way
protect, give additional layer blood-brain barrier might imagine
testes ovaries, going blood gonadal barrier. barriers
exist make just eat something, just ingest
doesn't mean going cross blood-brain barrier, L-carnitine taken
acetylated converted form gets across blood-brain barrier.
lot effects, involved mitochondrial activation long chain fatty acids
big mouthful, get time talking metabolic,
interesting effects neuro side. decide check
examine.com see really interesting things, lots effects ammonia, C-


reactive proteins, things sort, blood glucose lowered, et cetera. stuff
level blood periphery, slight effects lowering cholesterol.
interesting ones. Rates pregnancy go way people taking L-carnitine
father mother source sperm source egg affected
ways favors pregnancy. increase, go sperm quality
sperm motility males seems positive effects females
polycystic ovary syndrome. check out. know, effects strong.
three studies listed there. Again, not promoting this, people
take L-carnitine, especially trying get pregnant check
effects studies mentioned published peer reviewed rigorous
journals. terms neural effects. quite interesting. effects
depression still emerging seem exist people feel notable
decrease depressive symptoms. seven studies listed examine.com
notable benefit variety circumstances participants heightened
depression already. start taking L-carnitine start feeling better.
talk dosages various studies. also shown notable
decrease symptoms autism, find fascinating. Also again, things
ingest impact chemicals brain impact rest body.
things used treat certain forms alcohol dependence.
think going exciting emerging area. gonna whole month
addiction. got great guest lined month, now
emerging field people can take supplement help ease cravings
withdrawal trying quit drugs abuse, like cocaine, alcohol, heroin,
smoking things sort. really interesting area. is, like think
early days gonna discover lot more. huge list things here. Since
talked pain previous episode know lot people written
fibromyalgia. L carnitine shown reduce symptoms
fibromyalgia. Again, links studies examine.com, totally free site.
bulldog battering ram. nothing graceful bulldog.
decided wanted leave go get drink water. please forgive noise.
Okay. now turn another aspect gut-brain relationship will surprise
you, cases might shock you. really cool actionable
biology. gut microbiome, probiotics prebiotics. know today
talking emotions not pain remiss didn't mention another effect


acetylcarnitine reported can find listed link study
examine.com effect reducing symptoms migraine.
randomized controlled trial 133 participants frequent migraines.
taking 500 milligrams L-carnitine nothing 12 weeks. control little bit,

deal gut microbiome gut brain axis. Today actually
talking lot already gut brain axis nothing
microbiomes. talking vagus nerve connects providing
sensory information body brain. brain also sends
nerve motor information control motility got heart rate fast

oftentimes hear gut brain axis days, discussion
gut microbiome. again, situation incredible biology,
happy much discussion gut microbiome. somewhat
dismayed concerned hear either false partially
false. gonna clear misconceptions, first understanding

mainly changing conditions gut environment. addition
that, impact neurotransmitters neurons live gut.

just talk general rules thumb related research quality research
peer reviewed. future episode

01:21:55 Probiotics, Brain Fog, Autism, Fermentation

will go far deeper gut microbiome gut brain axis. things
think might find surprising. First all, supporting healthy gut microbiome
good mood, great digestion great immune system function. However,
not mean maxing taking probiotic prebiotic can
possibly manage. mentioned many times believe probiotics, take
probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case
better. things like brain fog can come that, brain fog just
inability focus. People feel really not well generally. studies
little bit controversial think fair say people really increase amount
probiotic taking beyond certain amount start feeling foggy
mind. Now much? Well get probiotics mentioned Athletic
Greens, can get fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,
different sources around world. Actually, love hear
sources people know foods around world. fascinated
way different cultures arrived foods provide support
healthy microbiomes fermented. colleague Stanford, Justin
Sonnenberg, talked this. don't want quote
inappropriately, discussions it, published
ingestion fermented foods one best ways support healthy levels gut
microbiota without exceeding threshold cause things like brain fog.
foods fermented foods going best source. number
different ways one that. people don't like fermented foods, however
people supplement it. isn't case better. know that.
true healthy gut microbiota shown improve symptoms
certain psychiatric illnesses well certain conditions like particular features along
autism spectrum, interesting. effects probably due not just
improvement immune system function, conditions neurons
sense nutrients convey information brain increase levels serotonin


dopamine. gut microbiome provides kind foundation healthy gut
healthy gut brain access much people report start eating
small bits 'cause doesn't require lot fermented foods, overall mood
better, not unlike effects EPA. Although don't think looked directly
context clinical depression yet. someone knows study please mention
comments. terrific. things can really
damage gut microbiome. huge misconception want
clear up. study published "Nature", among three
top journals science. know, "Nature", "Science"

01:25:20 Artificial Sweeteners & Gut Microbiome: NOT Bad; Depends!

"Cell" considered top tops, excellent journal showed artificial
sweeteners particular artificial sweetener saccharin can disrupt gut
microbiome ways detrimental number different health markers,
increasing inflammatory cytokines bad things happen gut
microbiome thrown off kilter. study widely discussed
things not mentioned really important. study
saccharin particular. Saccharin not typical artificial sweetener used,
typical artificial sweeteners used things like aspartame, so-called
NutraSweet Sucralose, days Stevia, monk fruits, knowledge
please correct anyone knows studies, knowledge, negative
effects artificial sweeteners gut microbiome restricted saccharin.
Now enough chemical similarity saccharin ones
mentioned, not them. instance, Stevia, monk fruit distinct
chemical makeup probably don't any, lower effects,
negative effects gut microbiome, still tested. saccharin
really, shown study several studies can really negatively impact
quality gut microbiome. Interestingly, narrative around artificial sweeteners
gut microbiome incorrect. people thought, oh, saccharin bad
microbiome. must kill microbiome. hear people saying, oh, artificial

certain artificial sweeteners particular saccharin disrupt microbiome make
environment within gut mucosal lining favorable bacteria microbiota
not good organism. important distinction. not just language
thing people say, oh, know, kills microbiome. doesn't kill
microbiome. shifts microbiome shifts microbiome can good
can bad. takes us another topic bit hot button topic

01:28:00 Ketogenic, Vegan, & Processed Food Effects, Individual Differences

willing go there. 'Cause think deserves conversation, nowadays
many examples people switched kind standard
diet even vegetarian diet vegan diet, keto diet. Now keto doesn't
necessarily mean ingestion meats, can. experience
positive effects themselves. Not everybody. talked previously
kind incorrect, believe incorrect marketing keto relates
cosmetic effects challenges sleep people
people love keto works great them. ketogenic diet interesting
one shifts ketogenic diet shift gut microbiome.
people end feeling better. people end feeling worse. Likewise,
people go ingesting animal products including meat vegetarian
go vegan experience positive shifts mood affect. know
transition plant-based diet especially enrichment fiber
present diets also creates dramatic shifts gut microbiome. people
feel better that. people feel worse. course, gonna depend
whether not ingesting lot processed foods not. paper
published "Cell", "Cell Press" journal obviously, excellent journal, showing
ingestion processed foods, regardless whether not come animal
sources non-animal sources processed foods tend create activity
within body surely roots nervous system lead over-
consumption calories weight gain. Even weight gain couldn't
explained increased calories. words, processed foods bad, regardless

advice. note fasting. colleague Yale, expert

01:33:20 Fasting-Based Depletion Microbiome

gut microbiome. told something really interesting,
fast, actually digest certain components within dietary tract. actually depletes
good amount gut microbiome. interesting. good results
guess call intermittent kind circadian type fasting never
done long fast, push first meal hours first meal
generally around lunchtime longer periods fasting go day
two three days known deplete gut microbiome major ways. not
always necessarily bad thing replenished, often replenished

mental effects returning eating feeding sometimes people don't
feel good start eating. really want food, start eating
again. don't feel good fast. may related
depletion microbiome occurs long fast. again, something
think talk doctor, idea fasting across board
good. may merits that, certainly cases,
deplete microbiome depletion microbiome significant
means return eating, actually not position digest

brain body way prior fast. is, think people
suggest kind gradual transition back consuming nutrients fast.
round up, want share results without question will impact

central theme studies tell about.

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues
experiment took housekeepers, essentially hotel workers,


divide two groups. watch short film. one case, film
work important help people feel comfortable hotel, et

group told activity good showed lower blood
pressure. lost significant amount body fat reported enjoying
work far group. work, simply biased mentally
information given, physiology followed information.
not just placebo effect. incredible set findings illustrate
extent whether not believe food gonna good us not good
us. Well, can't escape reality. can't tell poison gonna
good ingest poison expect not kill you, can tell
eating 12 croissants, confess done it, long run, long time
ago can't tell necessarily going good
gonna make lose weight. belief effects not lying
cases, experiments notice subjects didn't prior knowledge
grehlin effects daily routine weight loss blood

can't simply lie tell want believe
important, also important mind body fascinating
interplay. today talked mainly body things put

impacting cells, neurons, microbiota mucosal lining, heart, lungs
information feeding brain impact feel here.
also feel impacting body reacts levels core
physiology couldn't just tell gonna work,
believe certain substances, certain foods, certain nutrients profound

00:06:41 Nutrients, Neurochemicals Mood

body interact create things called emotions context food
nutrition. reason not beating drum
particular diet regimens anything. fact, not gonna that.
gonna gonna review important scientific data point
ingesting certain nutrients, macro nutrients like proteins, fats,
carbohydrates, well micronutrients can impact chemicals brain give
rise feelings happy sad sleepy alert want sleepy
sleepy want alert. sure broad discussion yet
gonna get specific emotions are, arise body, tools
one can use order better control emotions, tools people can use
believe not feel happier feel calmer. last 20 years
explosion scientific studies exploring brain body interact
support certain neurochemicals give us feelings alert happy
depressed certain life gonna terrible certain life going
great. mysterious might sound confusing might sound
gonna make clear today. gonna come away
conversation lot tools can act immediately. tools
grounded scientific data. gonna provide links several studies,
gonna mention several studies go along. overall, goal today
understand moods emotions arise different pathways
brain body allow happen can use pathways
change emotions tools can rely specific ways shift
being, say, slightly depressed, feeling happier. actually ways
that, feeling alert anxious feeling calmer.

00:08:39 Primitive Expressions Actions

tools distinct tools talked previous episodes.
discussion around emotions long rich history going back Darwin.
even long Darwin, conversation philosophers scientists


hundreds not thousands years. idea Darwin put forth
really attractive last hundred years emotions
universal facial expressions around emotion universal
people capitalized idea. extent true. mean, think
two robust examples see something smell
something taste something like, tend postural leaning
in. tend inhale air time, tend bring whatever chemical
substances is. tend mm's kind lean closer things
attractive us. see experience things don't like sometimes
mild aversion. just kind lean back look away. times intensive
version disgust tend cringe face. tend avoid inhaling
chemicals. probably roots ancient biological mechanisms prevent
us ingesting things bad us, chemical compounds tastes might
poisonous. much foundation discussion emotion center
around kind push pull attraction things aversion things. Now
basic way thinking emotions think it, works lot
different circumstances brain everywhere deep circuits brain
kind call higher order evolved centers brain.
push pull thing either previous episode, talked go, circuits allow
emphasize action no go circuits, circuits basal ganglia
allow de-emphasize action prevent action. talked push
pull. aversion attraction push pull too. Delight happiness excitement
attractions certain things ideas, songs, people, places, foods aversion leaning
out. disgust, avoidance. can break discussion
emotions simpler versions themselves, core attraction
aversion important theme might realize already. people tend
overlook action either moving forward
moving away something. time talking action nervous
system, talking motor behaviors. talking literally
contraction muscles move toward away things. time
talking nerve muscle action, talking brain body,
brain can't move brain body organism can
move. body brain organism, you, can move toward away
things deem good bad you. Now, things


attracted avoid call innate hardwired.
know, taste bitter compounds, not saying bitter like little bit
bitters drink something like that, really bitter compounds. tend avoid
associated poisons. taste things sweet
savory tend pursue those. tend lean toward
speak tend not avoid them. circuits brain aversion
attraction toward things.

00:12:30 Vagus Nerve: Truth, Fiction, Function

body governing lot that. immediately conversation want
raise important point nerve pathway many, many people
heard gets discussed time. one kind oversold
wrong reasons undersold, unfortunately, real power, vagus
nerve. vagus nerve one, not only, one way brain body
connected regulates emotional states. Now, many probably
heard polyvagal theory. gonna talk today. Polyvagal theory
popularized Stephen Porges interesting theory, certain aspects it,
frankly, hold science, doesn't. gonna discuss
today. lot vagus excitement vagus, V-A-G-U-S,
somehow got mind public vagus involved calming us down.
vagus nerve? Okay, gonna make really simple, particular
just listening, can just imagine this, watching point
various areas, basically vagus 10th cranial nerve basically means
neurons, control center neurons vagus lives just kind
near neck, right? branch vagus goes brain. send little
wire brain. branch goes periphery not just gut. goes
stomach, intestines heart, lungs, immune system.
vagus nerve incredible taking information body two
directions. first call sensory. sensing things happening
gut lungs, everything, example, lungs lungs distended,
vagus nerve senses sends information brain. also
consents things gut like distended empty stomach happens be,
can sense heart rate. can sense immune system, whether not


bacteria things invading body. sends information brain.
two-way street sensory information going brain.
vagus. like super highway sensory information going one way
direction motor control. vagus not just sensing things. actually
controlling things. got sensory pathway motor pathway. first
thing think everyone know vagus. fact, important feel
like important people knowing walking involves flexors extensors.
don't think important, important walking, frankly,
vagus way can govern brain body connection.
can steer various aspects mood wellbeing, people just don't
understand use it. first got understand is. got sensory
information coming different organs body brain. got
motor information going brain back body. got super
highway within you. Now actually regulates vagus. Oftentimes hear things
like, oh particular behavior

00:15:45 “Vagus Stimulation”: Terrible Concept

rubbing face particular location breathing particular way, warm bath
something stimulates vagus. Well, right now, want everyone know that, quote
unquote, stimulating vagus broadly speaking terrible way think
vagus know what, contaminant inside body vagus
senses projects information brain, start generate fever
start try kill contaminant body. don't know want
stimulate vagus just general theme today, going get specific
can activate particular circuits, certain pathways certain organs brain
order feel better relieve certain conditions. certainly don't want just
stimulate vagus.

00:16:35 Polyvagal Theory

Now excitement vagus part quite honestly, fairly
pioneering theory vagus polyvagal theory. polyvagal, word
poly means many, cool acknowledges vagus lot different


branches. not just one thing. really liked that. liked naming polyvagal.
idea Porges put forward dorsal vagus, kind
runs back spinal cord, involved alertness activation kind
fight flight type stuff. ventral pathway involved
kind empathic behaviors. not quite agreement modern
anatomy, best time. So, okay. problem
polyvagal theory way discussed people often say, oh
dorsal vagus active tend someone little keyed
people kind state freeze kind flacid kind like just not really
active just lethargic. Well, pathway hypoactive.
active. lot theories psychology maps onto vagus.
far know, don't map real physiology. Now, problem kind
way polyvagal theory discussed probably not real experts,
lot people people start diagnose different psychological physical
manifestations vagus. say things like, Oh person hyper
flexible joints therefore dorsal vagus isn't active enough something like
that. really kind gone way outside lane lines. today gonna clean
lot that. make really simple

00:18:27 Vagus Senses Many Things, & Moves Organs

vagus actually works. least understand today 2021. First
all, mentioned, sensory information way detect light
eyes hear sounds ears, sensors gut sense
full empty gut is. can also sense acidic gut is. can sense
various things within gut. heart same. informing brain
fast heart beating, full lungs communicated
status immune system. way think vagus way
think eyes. eyes looking colors, looking motion
looking bright is. one things, features telling
brain something different. brain can decide awake asleep whether
not looking somebody's attractive unattractive. vagus nerve also
analyzing many features within body informing brain feel
do. really good example think exciting one relates


sugar. know sweet things generally tastes good.

00:19:35 Sugar Sensing Without Perception Sweetness

not particularly fan sweet things. know, much rather cheese
pizza hamburger steak. like savory fatty foods, like sweet foods.
people find sweet foods attractive. want them, might might not
able regulate behavior around them, want them. really
interesting hundreds years people thought
way sweet foods taste. makes sense, right? eat something tastes
sweet. want it. Well, turns much interesting that.
eat something sweet within stomach, cells, neurons,
sense presence sugary foods independent taste signal brain.
sensors, neurons send information vagus brain goes
series stations. release dopamine. molecule makes
want whatever just ingested. fact, pathway
powerful done experiments completely numb taste
feeling somebody's mouth blindfolded. don't know eating
eating food. either sugary not sugary. find
even though people can't taste sugary food crave food contains
sugar sensors gut, sense sugar. put differently,
actually sensors within body make crave sugar independent
sweet taste things. Now incredible. does, tells us
circuits body driving us towards certain behaviors
making us feel good even though can't perceive them. Now,
really interested gut intuition kind gut feelings gut feeling except
chemical gut feeling. particular set neurons detecting something
body particular feature, case presence sugars, sending
information brain essentially control behavior. find remarkable,
means call attractive isn't always coming
thoughts feelings, even perception. drawn particular
foods drawn perhaps also particular people, places things
information coming body. gonna talk
one can information. know many people thoughtful concerned


sugars days thinking ingest much sugar. sugar snuck
things eat. indeed, true. mean, completely reframe way
think sort so-called hidden sugars foods. means
even food savory like piece pizza piece bread even like salad
dressing sugar snuck can't taste will still crave
thing without knowing crave sugar. words,
might find wanting certain foods not knowing want foods.
find fascinating aspect biology yes, relates mood
emotion. talk moment.

00:23:00 Eating-Induced Anxiety

just back bit ask question eat certain things?
certain foods make us feel good? foods actually make us feel anxious.
think people may familiar this. people might not, people
don't realize approach eating anxiety associated that.
alertness. Remember previous discussions, even don't haven't
seen those, moods feelings wellbeing anchored continuum
alertness versus calmness. hear often rest digest. know
that, oh, eat, feel really nice full, hopefully comfortably full not
full. relaxing. feel satiated, associated serotonin molecule
satiation. true. people don't know area
hypothalamus. deepen brain kind middle deep portion brain called
lateral hypothalamus. lateral hypothalamus really interesting
controls feeding, inhibits feeding. stops us feeding. another area
brain. want names, give you. don't want names, just ignore
them, delete memory awareness, called locus coeruleus, now
locus coeruleus sits back brainstem releases norepinephrine
essentially adrenaline. makes us feel alert. Now, locus coeruleus lot
different functions brain, going eat say walk
restaurant, sit preparing meal, locus coeruleus known release
noradrenaline brain. creating kind alertness. ancient utility,
creating alertness. many people, experience approach food
stress anxiety. interesting approach food locus coeruleus


releasing molecules make us feel anxious alert sometimes
felt excitement. asks probably feel food generally,
happy relationship food? trying restrict relationship
food, people coming dinner, will play course,
certain stress anxiety upon approach food. approach food feel
anxiety locus coeruleus activates lateral hypothalamus way inhibits
feeding makes us not want eat. lot people kind pre-meal
anxiety anxiety around food can't seem just calm good
meal access later rest digest. lot heightened
stress upon approach food lot tools there, eating
disorders just kind general public isn't suffering eating disorders,
things like mindfulness around meals. know, always tell never
eat stressed. sorry, life not organized way can that.
never eat. Right eat awake don't know stressed,
don't think tend run around lot day. don't generally take
time two three deep breaths eat. generally will just eat. can
healthy unhealthy depending quality digestion. think using digestion
guide good, lot people aren't aware interaction locus
coeruleus lateral hypothalamus basic mechanism supposed
get little bit alert anxious around mealtime. eat, mechanisms
calming satiation supposed kick mechanisms involve
mentioned earlier, two things. One things taste, digestion starts mouth.
course, taste food. Everyone tells us chew food more. Yes,
can improve digestion. not supposed drink many fluids eat.
true too, lot feel eat eat vagus
sensing gut. sending information time. sugar?
fats? contaminants? lot information. so-called
parallel pathways going brain regulate whether not want
eat something not. accelerators, things make us want
eat more, like sugar fats nutrient dense. helps
generally, least short term

00:27:30 Eat Brain Perceives “Amino Acid Threshold”



support survival animals, also amino acids. important.
lot data, much comes data people eat
much eat subconscious detection many amino acids
array, meaning constellation amino acids given food. fair say
sum total studies pointing direction people will basically eat, not
stomach full brain perceives adequate intake
amino acids. Now, conversation comes context know,
meat, keto, kind zone diet, Mediterranean diet, vegan diet.
largely going ignore kind strict camps today. will talk little bit it,
think one actually taps something important brain
body relationship ones don't. don't want get discussion
ethics different foods animal based non animal based. 'Cause not
topic today. really nutrient sensing amino acid sensing. generally
will eat gut tells brain adequate amounts amino acids.
Amino acids course important building blocks sure,
muscle, things body need repair. people don't
realize amino acids neurochemicals brain made from.
Now, vitally important. Okay, heard dopamine molecule
makes feel good. Actually dopamine molecule makes feel good.
released within brain. feel good dopamine release,
dopamine releases caused surprise, excitement, events looking forward
turnout well, inhibited events looking forward don't work
someone says going call really really excited talk to,
don't, thought movie gonna really great not,
expect meal really delicious. kind of, eh, actually

00:29:45 Reward Prediction Error: Buildup, Letdown Wanting

name that. called reward prediction error. can actually use

know, essentially expect something really terrific really place higher
expectation chemical level. don't get much dopamine
expecting something, hear really great restaurant place
really, case, have, wouldn't call addiction. call


affliction croissants. best vegetable course, croissant. get really
excited fact someone will tell me, oh place
incredible croissants. gotta go there. get really excited, go. just
telling gonna really terrific raises expectation, dopamine
expectation. unless croissants amazing chances going
experience less good, less satisfying. will truly release less dopamine
just said, oh yeah, think croissants street.
just tried one random, reward prediction error
expectation something releases dopamine actual event releases dopamine.
event related dopamine not exceed expectation least match it,
much higher tendency won't pursue thing again. dopamine
really powerful not just molecule reward. molecule desire.

ask book recommendations. don't know author personally, love book.
called "The Molecule More". terrific book. wish written it, frankly,
want learn dopamine reward prediction error dopamine

Dopamine going lead us want eat something not want
something, dopamine really craving. motivation
desire. mentioned, amino acid sensors gut detecting
many amino acids

00:32:01 L-Tyrosine, Dopamine, Motivation, Mood, & Movement

also detecting amino acids. particular amino acid called
L-tyrosine comes food. can look online, foods contain L-
tyrosine. meats. nuts. also plant-based foods. L-tyrosine
precursor couple molecules like L-DOPA, et cetera, make dopamine.
misconception serotonin gut.
dopamine gut. therefore mood gut. not quite way
works. Okay. talk serotonin moment dopamine synthesized
amino acids eat. However, dopamine neurons give rise
feelings good wanting desire motivation, reside brain.
don't want get confused. want respect honor power gut


vagal pathway, really neurons within brain drive pursuit
decision-making, mean? Well, people make little dopamine.
people make little dopamine need prescription dopamine. need
L-DOPA, people Parkinson's take L-DOPA compounds increase
dopamine Parkinson's associated deficits movement, starts
tremor, actually starts things interesting. talk
moment, Parkinson's depression. blunting motivation mood

develop Parkinson's Parkinson's depletion dopamine neurons brain.
not just movement challenges.

00:34:04 Supplementing L-Tyrosine, Drugs Abuse, Wellbutrin

challenges mood. Now, hopefully don't Parkinson's,
clear dietary L-tyrosine supports healthy production things like
dopamine well factors within brain. Now, people immediately
ask, well supplement L-tyrosine? just talk
gonna come up. Full disclosure, sometimes take L-tyrosine. not taking right now,
take occasionally, can buy capsule form. increase kind
mood elevation alertness. counter. check
doctor. not responsible healthcare not doctor, whether not
safe you, people preexisting hyper dopaminergic conditions like mania
probably not take L-tyrosine. thing taking L-tyrosine crash,
okay? not massive crash take appropriate doses right
can produce crash lethargy kind brain fog next day so.
L-tyrosine however can ingested foods supplementation
increase dopamine levels. well-known, taken chronically however, can disrupt
dopamine pathways. Now drugs will increase L-tyrosine
dopamine well. severe enough generally tend
addictive properties. things like methamphetamine, things like cocaine terrible


really ramp dopamine system much people really can't
achieve dopamine release mechanisms. food ingestion
L-tyrosine profound effect levels dopamine. takes little
really will impact level mood. Certain antidepressants fall category
dopaminergic antidepressants. One famous ones course Wellbutrin.
Wellbutrin developed lot antidepressants tend make
people feel kind lethargic side effect profiles people didn't like.
developed thing that, generic name different, generally called
Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin activates dopamine epinephrin, substrate
dopamine. involved motivation alertness effort.
might say, wow, sounds like great drug. However, drug, side effect profile
tends things associated elevated mood alertness. isn't
like taking L-tyrosine. isn't like eating tyrosine rich foods. really
much greater release dopamine epinephrin, increases things like anxiety,
sweating, pupils dilate. certain effects on, particular people epilepsy,
used somewhat successfully smoking cessation, again, not
everybody not encourage use things. just describing
biology rationale drugs developed. back
second. just kind take stock at. brain body connection.
many them, one main ones vagus nerve. vagus
collects information lot things, breathing, heart rate stuff happening
gut, et cetera, gut way, includes stomach intestines, sends
information brain. brain using information decide one two
things, move toward something move away. can also pause, essentially pausing
not moving toward. dopamine pathway foods rich L-tyrosine
generally give us elevated mood make us want whatever
happen well things, motivation, generalizes things
not unique just ingesting foods foods give us big pulse dopamine will
make us crave food. will make us crave activity led
ingestion food. mentioned earlier, lot happening

stomach small intestine large intestine ask like, going
serotonin gut? impacting serotonin brain? think
context us might want increase decrease serotonin
levels. far know, aren't really good home blood tests things
like serotonin dopamine. commercial products there. me,
just me, not particularly impressed. know, not getting
hormones levels measured metabolic factors measured, can daunting.
can done rigorously. tests there. even some, believe
not. questionnaires that, think actually last year made
bigger newspapers, dopamine serotonin? that?
find stuff little silly although appreciate, like fact people
thinking talking neuromodulators aren't really great ways
measure things outside clinic. great clinical tools can
get inside hospital proper endocrinologist neurologist, no great at-
home tool. maybe call arms entrepreneurial folks
create tests, accurate tests please, done home.
people feel like anxious always motivated state
trying adjust serotonin. Many people adjust serotonin just eating
food

00:43:38 Eating Promote Dopamine (Daytime) & Serotonin (Night Time)



carbohydrate rich foods will increase serotonin. talked previous

can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall
around brain barrier brain important.
feature neurons don't recreate injury, like
organs body. not lot turnover cells despite might've
heard. nature created BBB, blood brain barrier make sure
certain molecules particular, large molecules don't get across blood-brain barrier.
'Cause can damaging tissues. Incidentally, also rigid

testes brain organs body nature gone way
protect, give additional layer blood-brain barrier might imagine
testes ovaries, going blood gonadal barrier. barriers
exist make just eat something, just ingest
doesn't mean going cross blood-brain barrier, L-carnitine taken
acetylated converted form gets across blood-brain barrier.
lot effects, involved mitochondrial activation long chain fatty acids
big mouthful, get time talking metabolic,
interesting effects neuro side. decide check

three studies listed there. Again, not promoting this, people
take L-carnitine, especially trying get pregnant check
effects studies mentioned published peer reviewed rigorous
journals. terms neural effects. quite interesting. effects
depression still emerging seem exist people feel notable
decrease depressive symptoms. seven studies listed examine.com
notable benefit variety circumstances participants heightened
depression already. start taking L-carnitine start feeling better.
talk dosages various studies. also shown notable
decrease symptoms autism, find fascinating. Also again, things
ingest impact chemicals brain impact rest body.
things used treat certain forms alcohol dependence.
think going exciting emerging area. gonna whole month

emerging field people can take supplement help ease cravings
withdrawal trying quit drugs abuse, like cocaine, alcohol, heroin,
smoking things sort. really interesting area. is, like think
early days gonna discover lot more. huge list things here. Since
talked pain previous episode know lot people written
fibromyalgia. L carnitine shown reduce symptoms
fibromyalgia. Again, links studies examine.com, totally free site.
bulldog battering ram. nothing graceful bulldog.
decided wanted leave go get drink water. please forgive noise.
Okay. now turn another aspect gut-brain relationship will surprise
you, cases might shock you. really cool actionable
biology. gut microbiome, probiotics prebiotics. know today
talking emotions not pain remiss didn't mention another effect


acetylcarnitine reported can find listed link study

01:16:29 Gut-Microbiome: Myths, Truths & Tubes Within Us

think super interesting potential therapeutics various people.
deal gut microbiome gut brain axis. Today actually
talking lot already gut brain axis nothing
microbiomes. talking vagus nerve connects providing
sensory information body brain. brain also sends
nerve motor information control motility got heart rate fast
breathe deployment immune stuff killer cells things sort.
oftentimes hear gut brain axis days, discussion
gut microbiome. again, situation incredible biology,
happy much discussion gut microbiome. somewhat
dismayed concerned hear either false partially
false. gonna clear misconceptions, first understanding

01:21:55 Probiotics, Brain Fog, Autism, Fermentation

will go far deeper gut microbiome gut brain axis. things
think might find surprising. First all, supporting healthy gut microbiome
good mood, great digestion great immune system function. However,
not mean maxing taking probiotic prebiotic can
possibly manage. mentioned many times believe probiotics, take
probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case
better. things like brain fog can come that, brain fog just
inability focus. People feel really not well generally. studies
little bit controversial think fair say people really increase amount
probiotic taking beyond certain amount start feeling foggy
mind. Now much? Well get probiotics mentioned Athletic
Greens, can get fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,
different sources around world. Actually, love hear
sources people know foods around world. fascinated
way different cultures arrived foods provide support
healthy microbiomes fermented. colleague Stanford, Justin

comments. terrific. things can really
damage gut microbiome. huge misconception want
clear up. study published "Nature", among three
top journals science. know, "Nature", "Science"

01:25:20 Artificial Sweeteners & Gut Microbiome: NOT Bad; Depends!

"Cell" considered top tops, excellent journal showed artificial
sweeteners particular artificial sweetener saccharin can disrupt gut
microbiome ways detrimental number different health markers,
increasing inflammatory cytokines bad things happen gut
microbiome thrown off kilter. study widely discussed
things not mentioned really important. study
saccharin particular. Saccharin not typical artificial sweetener used,
typical artificial sweeteners used things like aspartame, so-called
NutraSweet Sucralose, days Stevia, monk fruits, knowledge
please correct anyone knows studies, knowledge, negative
effects artificial sweeteners gut microbiome restricted saccharin.
Now enough chemical similarity saccharin ones
mentioned, not them. instance, Stevia, monk fruit distinct
chemical makeup probably don't any, lower effects,
negative effects gut microbiome, still tested. saccharin
really, shown study several studies can really negatively impact
quality gut microbiome. Interestingly, narrative around artificial sweeteners
gut microbiome incorrect. people thought, oh, saccharin bad

01:28:00 Ketogenic, Vegan, & Processed Food Effects, Individual Differences

willing go there. 'Cause think deserves conversation, nowadays
many examples people switched kind standard

necessarily mean ingestion meats, can. experience
positive effects themselves. Not everybody. talked previously
kind incorrect, believe incorrect marketing keto relates
cosmetic effects challenges sleep people
people love keto works great them. ketogenic diet interesting
one shifts ketogenic diet shift gut microbiome.
people end feeling better. people end feeling worse. Likewise,
people go ingesting animal products including meat vegetarian
go vegan experience positive shifts mood affect. know
transition plant-based diet especially enrichment fiber
present diets also creates dramatic shifts gut microbiome. people
feel better that. people feel worse. course, gonna depend
whether not ingesting lot processed foods not. paper
published "Cell", "Cell Press" journal obviously, excellent journal, showing
ingestion processed foods, regardless whether not come animal
sources non-animal sources processed foods tend create activity
within body surely roots nervous system lead over-
consumption calories weight gain. Even weight gain couldn't
explained increased calories. words, processed foods bad, regardless
whether not talking animal products non animal products, probably not
surprising given know sugar sensing amino acid sensing

whether not regenerative agriculture, animal products, farming
things, actually impact environment, not expertise,
comes health microbiome want support microbiome.
clear fermented foods support microbiome ingesting
least two servings per day. quite lot supplementation low levels can
good. Supplementation high levels can create brain fog even though people
say result controversial. experienced data looked


pretty darn solid. one thing think well. thing

advice. note fasting. colleague Yale, expert

01:33:20 Fasting-Based Depletion Microbiome

gut microbiome. told something really interesting,
fast, actually digest certain components within dietary tract. actually depletes
good amount gut microbiome. interesting. good results
guess call intermittent kind circadian type fasting never
done long fast, push first meal hours first meal
generally around lunchtime longer periods fasting go day
two three days known deplete gut microbiome major ways. not
always necessarily bad thing replenished, often replenished
levels exceeded previous level. think GI tract even
mental effects returning eating feeding sometimes people don't
feel good start eating. really want food, start eating
again. don't feel good fast. may related
depletion microbiome occurs long fast. again, something
think talk doctor, idea fasting across board
good. may merits that, certainly cases,
deplete microbiome depletion microbiome significant
means return eating, actually not position digest
assimilate foods. foods not position impact
brain body way prior fast. is, think people
suggest kind gradual transition back consuming nutrients fast.
round up, want share results without question will impact
way respond food mentally even physically. know
central theme studies tell about.

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues
experiment took housekeepers, essentially hotel workers,


divide two groups. watch short film. one case, film
work important help people feel comfortable hotel, et
cetera, et cetera. group heard activity

01:38:30 Mindset Controls Metabolism

cleaning taking care hotel good them. good
health, et cetera, et cetera. controlled nicely study health
parameters, individual differences. behaviors people
period followed short tutorial. found eight weeks later,
group told activity good showed lower blood
pressure. lost significant amount body fat reported enjoying
work far group. work, simply biased mentally
information given, physiology followed information.
not just placebo effect. incredible set findings illustrate
extent whether not believe food gonna good us not good
us. Well, can't escape reality. can't tell poison gonna
good ingest poison expect not kill you, can tell
eating 12 croissants, confess done it, long run, long time
ago can't tell necessarily going good
gonna make lose weight. belief effects not lying
cases, experiments notice subjects didn't prior knowledge
grehlin effects daily routine weight loss blood
pressure. order work naive information, right?
can't simply lie tell want believe
important, also important mind body fascinating
interplay. today talked mainly body things put
inside tube, runs mouth end rectum, basically
impacting cells, neurons, microbiota mucosal lining, heart, lungs
information feeding brain impact feel here.
also feel impacting body reacts levels core
physiology couldn't just tell gonna work,
believe certain substances, certain foods, certain nutrients profound
effect magnitude impact

hundreds not thousands years. idea Darwin put forth
really attractive last hundred years emotions
universal facial expressions around emotion universal
people capitalized idea. extent true. mean, think
two robust examples see something smell
something taste something like, tend postural leaning
in. tend inhale air time, tend bring whatever chemical
substances is. tend mm's kind lean closer things
attractive us. see experience things don't like sometimes
mild aversion. just kind lean back look away. times intensive
version disgust tend cringe face. tend avoid inhaling
chemicals. probably roots ancient biological mechanisms prevent
us ingesting things bad us, chemical compounds tastes might
poisonous. much foundation discussion emotion center
around kind push pull attraction things aversion things. Now
basic way thinking emotions think it, works lot
different circumstances brain everywhere deep circuits brain
kind call higher order evolved centers brain.
push pull thing either previous episode, talked go, circuits allow
emphasize action no go circuits, circuits basal ganglia
allow de-emphasize action prevent action. talked push
pull. aversion attraction push pull too. Delight happiness excitement
attractions certain things ideas, songs, people, places, foods aversion leaning
out. disgust, avoidance. can break discussion
emotions simpler versions themselves, core attraction
aversion important theme might realize already. people tend
overlook action either moving forward
moving away something. time talking action nervous
system, talking motor behaviors. talking literally

talking nerve muscle action, talking brain body,

savory tend pursue those. tend lean toward
speak tend not avoid them. circuits brain aversion
attraction toward things.

00:12:30 Vagus Nerve: Truth, Fiction, Function

body governing lot that. immediately conversation want
raise important point nerve pathway many, many people
heard gets discussed time. one kind oversold
wrong reasons undersold, unfortunately, real power, vagus
nerve. vagus nerve one, not only, one way brain body
connected regulates emotional states. Now, many probably
heard polyvagal theory. gonna talk today. Polyvagal theory
popularized Stephen Porges interesting theory, certain aspects it,
frankly, hold science, doesn't. gonna discuss
today. lot vagus excitement vagus, V-A-G-U-S,
somehow got mind public vagus involved calming us down.
vagus nerve? Okay, gonna make really simple, particular
just listening, can just imagine this, watching point
various areas, basically vagus 10th cranial nerve basically means
neurons, control center neurons vagus lives just kind
near neck, right? branch vagus goes brain. send little
wire brain. branch goes periphery not just gut. goes
stomach, intestines heart, lungs, immune system.
vagus nerve incredible taking information body two
directions. first call sensory. sensing things happening
gut lungs, everything, example, lungs lungs distended,
vagus nerve senses sends information brain. also
consents things gut like distended empty stomach happens be,
can sense heart rate. can sense immune system, whether not


bacteria things invading body. sends information brain.
two-way street sensory information going brain.
vagus. like super highway sensory information going one way
direction motor control. vagus not just sensing things. actually
controlling things. got sensory pathway motor pathway. first
thing think everyone know vagus. fact, important feel
like important people knowing walking involves flexors extensors.
don't think important, important walking, frankly,
vagus way can govern brain body connection.
can steer various aspects mood wellbeing, people just don't
understand use it. first got understand is. got sensory
information coming different organs body brain. got
motor information going brain back body. got super
highway within you. Now actually regulates vagus. Oftentimes hear things
like, oh particular behavior

00:15:45 “Vagus Stimulation”: Terrible Concept

rubbing face particular location breathing particular way, warm bath
something stimulates vagus. Well, right now, want everyone know that, quote
unquote, stimulating vagus broadly speaking terrible way think
vagus know what, contaminant inside body vagus
senses projects information brain, start generate fever
start try kill contaminant body. don't know want
stimulate vagus just general theme today, going get specific
can activate particular circuits, certain pathways certain organs brain
order feel better relieve certain conditions. certainly don't want just
stimulate vagus.

00:16:35 Polyvagal Theory

Now excitement vagus part quite honestly, fairly
pioneering theory vagus polyvagal theory. polyvagal, word
poly means many, cool acknowledges vagus lot different


branches. not just one thing. really liked that. liked naming polyvagal.
idea Porges put forward dorsal vagus, kind
runs back spinal cord, involved alertness activation kind
fight flight type stuff. ventral pathway involved
kind empathic behaviors. not quite agreement modern
anatomy, best time. So, okay. problem
polyvagal theory way discussed people often say, oh
dorsal vagus active tend someone little keyed
people kind state freeze kind flacid kind like just not really
active just lethargic. Well, pathway hypoactive.
active. lot theories psychology maps onto vagus.
far know, don't map real physiology. Now, problem kind
way polyvagal theory discussed probably not real experts,
lot people people start diagnose different psychological physical
manifestations vagus. say things like, Oh person hyper
flexible joints therefore dorsal vagus isn't active enough something like
that. really kind gone way outside lane lines. today gonna clean
lot that. make really simple

00:18:27 Vagus Senses Many Things, & Moves Organs

vagus actually works. least understand today 2021. First
all, mentioned, sensory information way detect light
eyes hear sounds ears, sensors gut sense
full empty gut is. can also sense acidic gut is. can sense
various things within gut. heart same. informing brain
fast heart beating, full lungs communicated
status immune system. way think vagus way
think eyes. eyes looking colors, looking motion
looking bright is. one things, features telling
brain something different. brain can decide awake asleep whether
not looking somebody's attractive unattractive. vagus nerve also
analyzing many features within body informing brain feel
do. really good example think exciting one relates


sugar. know sweet things generally tastes good.

00:19:35 Sugar Sensing Without Perception Sweetness

not particularly fan sweet things. know, much rather cheese
pizza hamburger steak. like savory fatty foods, like sweet foods.
people find sweet foods attractive. want them, might might not
able regulate behavior around them, want them. really
interesting hundreds years people thought
way sweet foods taste. makes sense, right? eat something tastes
sweet. want it. Well, turns much interesting that.
eat something sweet within stomach, cells, neurons,
sense presence sugary foods independent taste signal brain.
sensors, neurons send information vagus brain goes
series stations. release dopamine. molecule makes
want whatever just ingested. fact, pathway
powerful done experiments completely numb taste
feeling somebody's mouth blindfolded. don't know eating
eating food. either sugary not sugary. find
even though people can't taste sugary food crave food contains
sugar sensors gut, sense sugar. put differently,
actually sensors within body make crave sugar independent
sweet taste things. Now incredible. does, tells us
circuits body driving us towards certain behaviors
making us feel good even though can't perceive them. Now,
really interested gut intuition kind gut feelings gut feeling except
chemical gut feeling. particular set neurons detecting something
body particular feature, case presence sugars, sending
information brain essentially control behavior. find remarkable,
means call attractive isn't always coming
thoughts feelings, even perception. drawn particular
foods drawn perhaps also particular people, places things
information coming body. gonna talk
one can information. know many people thoughtful concerned


sugars days thinking ingest much sugar. sugar snuck
things eat. indeed, true. mean, completely reframe way
think sort so-called hidden sugars foods. means
even food savory like piece pizza piece bread even like salad
dressing sugar snuck can't taste will still crave
thing without knowing crave sugar. words,
might find wanting certain foods not knowing want foods.
find fascinating aspect biology yes, relates mood
emotion. talk moment.

00:23:00 Eating-Induced Anxiety

just back bit ask question eat certain things?
certain foods make us feel good? foods actually make us feel anxious.
think people may familiar this. people might not, people
don't realize approach eating anxiety associated that.
alertness. Remember previous discussions, even don't haven't
seen those, moods feelings wellbeing anchored continuum
alertness versus calmness. hear often rest digest. know
that, oh, eat, feel really nice full, hopefully comfortably full not
full. relaxing. feel satiated, associated serotonin molecule
satiation. true. people don't know area
hypothalamus. deepen brain kind middle deep portion brain called
lateral hypothalamus. lateral hypothalamus really interesting
controls feeding, inhibits feeding. stops us feeding. another area
brain. want names, give you. don't want names, just ignore
them, delete memory awareness, called locus coeruleus, now
locus coeruleus sits back brainstem releases norepinephrine
essentially adrenaline. makes us feel alert. Now, locus coeruleus lot
different functions brain, going eat say walk
restaurant, sit preparing meal, locus coeruleus known release
noradrenaline brain. creating kind alertness. ancient utility,
creating alertness. many people, experience approach food
stress anxiety. interesting approach food locus coeruleus


releasing molecules make us feel anxious alert sometimes
felt excitement. asks probably feel food generally,
happy relationship food? trying restrict relationship
food, people coming dinner, will play course,
certain stress anxiety upon approach food. approach food feel
anxiety locus coeruleus activates lateral hypothalamus way inhibits
feeding makes us not want eat. lot people kind pre-meal
anxiety anxiety around food can't seem just calm good
meal access later rest digest. lot heightened
stress upon approach food lot tools there, eating
disorders just kind general public isn't suffering eating disorders,
things like mindfulness around meals. know, always tell never
eat stressed. sorry, life not organized way can that.
never eat. Right eat awake don't know stressed,
don't think tend run around lot day. don't generally take
time two three deep breaths eat. generally will just eat. can
healthy unhealthy depending quality digestion. think using digestion
guide good, lot people aren't aware interaction locus
coeruleus lateral hypothalamus basic mechanism supposed
get little bit alert anxious around mealtime. eat, mechanisms
calming satiation supposed kick mechanisms involve
mentioned earlier, two things. One things taste, digestion starts mouth.
course, taste food. Everyone tells us chew food more. Yes,
can improve digestion. not supposed drink many fluids eat.
true too, lot feel eat eat vagus
sensing gut. sending information time. sugar?
fats? contaminants? lot information. so-called
parallel pathways going brain regulate whether not want
eat something not. accelerators, things make us want
eat more, like sugar fats nutrient dense. helps
generally, least short term

00:27:30 Eat Brain Perceives “Amino Acid Threshold”



support survival animals, also amino acids. important.
lot data, much comes data people eat
much eat subconscious detection many amino acids
array, meaning constellation amino acids given food. fair say
sum total studies pointing direction people will basically eat, not
stomach full brain perceives adequate intake
amino acids. Now, conversation comes context know,
meat, keto, kind zone diet, Mediterranean diet, vegan diet.
largely going ignore kind strict camps today. will talk little bit it,
think one actually taps something important brain
body relationship ones don't. don't want get discussion
ethics different foods animal based non animal based. 'Cause not
topic today. really nutrient sensing amino acid sensing. generally
will eat gut tells brain adequate amounts amino acids.
Amino acids course important building blocks sure,
muscle, things body need repair. people don't
realize amino acids neurochemicals brain made from.
Now, vitally important. Okay, heard dopamine molecule
makes feel good. Actually dopamine molecule makes feel good.
released within brain. feel good dopamine release,
dopamine releases caused surprise, excitement, events looking forward
turnout well, inhibited events looking forward don't work
someone says going call really really excited talk to,
don't, thought movie gonna really great not,
expect meal really delicious. kind of, eh, actually

00:29:45 Reward Prediction Error: Buildup, Letdown Wanting

name that. called reward prediction error. can actually use
context meals plans way useful people
know, essentially expect something really terrific really place higher
expectation chemical level. don't get much dopamine

also detecting amino acids. particular amino acid called
L-tyrosine comes food. can look online, foods contain L-
tyrosine. meats. nuts. also plant-based foods. L-tyrosine
precursor couple molecules like L-DOPA, et cetera, make dopamine.
misconception serotonin gut.
dopamine gut. therefore mood gut. not quite way
works. Okay. talk serotonin moment dopamine synthesized
amino acids eat. However, dopamine neurons give rise
feelings good wanting desire motivation, reside brain.

not just movement challenges.

00:34:04 Supplementing L-Tyrosine, Drugs Abuse, Wellbutrin

challenges mood. Now, hopefully don't Parkinson's,
clear dietary L-tyrosine supports healthy production things like
dopamine well factors within brain. Now, people immediately
ask, well supplement L-tyrosine? just talk
gonna come up. Full disclosure, sometimes take L-tyrosine. not taking right now,
take occasionally, can buy capsule form. increase kind
mood elevation alertness. counter. check
doctor. not responsible healthcare not doctor, whether not
safe you, people preexisting hyper dopaminergic conditions like mania
probably not take L-tyrosine. thing taking L-tyrosine crash,
okay? not massive crash take appropriate doses right
can produce crash lethargy kind brain fog next day so.
L-tyrosine however can ingested foods supplementation
increase dopamine levels. well-known, taken chronically however, can disrupt
dopamine pathways. Now drugs will increase L-tyrosine
dopamine well. severe enough generally tend
addictive properties. things like methamphetamine, things like cocaine terrible


really ramp dopamine system much people really can't
achieve dopamine release mechanisms. food ingestion
L-tyrosine profound effect levels dopamine. takes little
really will impact level mood. Certain antidepressants fall category
dopaminergic antidepressants. One famous ones course Wellbutrin.
Wellbutrin developed lot antidepressants tend make
people feel kind lethargic side effect profiles people didn't like.
developed thing that, generic name different, generally called
Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin activates dopamine epinephrin, substrate
dopamine. involved motivation alertness effort.
might say, wow, sounds like great drug. However, drug, side effect profile
tends things associated elevated mood alertness. isn't
like taking L-tyrosine. isn't like eating tyrosine rich foods. really
much greater release dopamine epinephrin, increases things like anxiety,
sweating, pupils dilate. certain effects on, particular people epilepsy,
used somewhat successfully smoking cessation, again, not
everybody not encourage use things. just describing
biology rationale drugs developed. back
second. just kind take stock at. brain body connection.
many them, one main ones vagus nerve. vagus
collects information lot things, breathing, heart rate stuff happening
gut, et cetera, gut way, includes stomach intestines, sends
information brain. brain using information decide one two
things, move toward something move away. can also pause, essentially pausing
not moving toward. dopamine pathway foods rich L-tyrosine
generally give us elevated mood make us want whatever
happen well things, motivation, generalizes things
not unique just ingesting foods foods give us big pulse dopamine will
make us crave food. will make us crave activity led

like serotonin dopamine. commercial products there. me,
just me, not particularly impressed. know, not getting

can done rigorously. tests there. even some, believe
not. questionnaires that, think actually last year made
bigger newspapers, dopamine serotonin? that?
find stuff little silly although appreciate, like fact people
thinking talking neuromodulators aren't really great ways
measure things outside clinic. great clinical tools can
get inside hospital proper endocrinologist neurologist, no great at-
home tool. maybe call arms entrepreneurial folks
create tests, accurate tests please, done home.
people feel like anxious always motivated state
trying adjust serotonin. Many people adjust serotonin just eating
food

00:43:38 Eating Promote Dopamine (Daytime) & Serotonin (Night Time)



carbohydrate rich foods will increase serotonin. talked previous

00:44:30 Supplementing Serotonin: Sleep, & Caution Sleep Disruptions

don't like ingesting meat, starchy carbohydrates will increase serotonin.
people also will take serotonin. can now buy 5-HTP supplements.

good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman

colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact

00:12:30 Vagus Nerve: Truth, Fiction, Function

body governing lot that. immediately conversation want
raise important point nerve pathway many, many people
heard gets discussed time. one kind oversold
wrong reasons undersold, unfortunately, real power, vagus
nerve. vagus nerve one, not only, one way brain body
connected regulates emotional states. Now, many probably
heard polyvagal theory. gonna talk today. Polyvagal theory
popularized Stephen Porges interesting theory, certain aspects it,
frankly, hold science, doesn't. gonna discuss
today. lot vagus excitement vagus, V-A-G-U-S,
somehow got mind public vagus involved calming us down.
vagus nerve? Okay, gonna make really simple, particular
just listening, can just imagine this, watching point
various areas, basically vagus 10th cranial nerve basically means
neurons, control center neurons vagus lives just kind
near neck, right? branch vagus goes brain. send little
wire brain. branch goes periphery not just gut. goes
stomach, intestines heart, lungs, immune system.
vagus nerve incredible taking information body two
directions. first call sensory. sensing things happening
gut lungs, everything, example, lungs lungs distended,
vagus nerve senses sends information brain. also
consents things gut like distended empty stomach happens be,
can sense heart rate. can sense immune system, whether not


bacteria things invading body. sends information brain.
two-way street sensory information going brain.
vagus. like super highway sensory information going one way
direction motor control. vagus not just sensing things. actually
controlling things. got sensory pathway motor pathway. first
thing think everyone know vagus. fact, important feel
like important people knowing walking involves flexors extensors.
don't think important, important walking, frankly,
vagus way can govern brain body connection.
can steer various aspects mood wellbeing, people just don't
understand use it. first got understand is. got sensory
information coming different organs body brain. got
motor information going brain back body. got super
highway within you. Now actually regulates vagus. Oftentimes hear things
like, oh particular behavior

00:15:45 “Vagus Stimulation”: Terrible Concept

rubbing face particular location breathing particular way, warm bath
something stimulates vagus. Well, right now, want everyone know that, quote
unquote, stimulating vagus broadly speaking terrible way think
vagus know what, contaminant inside body vagus
senses projects information brain, start generate fever
start try kill contaminant body. don't know want
stimulate vagus just general theme today, going get specific
can activate particular circuits, certain pathways certain organs brain
order feel better relieve certain conditions. certainly don't want just
stimulate vagus.

00:16:35 Polyvagal Theory

Now excitement vagus part quite honestly, fairly
pioneering theory vagus polyvagal theory. polyvagal, word
poly means many, cool acknowledges vagus lot different


branches. not just one thing. really liked that. liked naming polyvagal.
idea Porges put forward dorsal vagus, kind
runs back spinal cord, involved alertness activation kind
fight flight type stuff. ventral pathway involved
kind empathic behaviors. not quite agreement modern
anatomy, best time. So, okay. problem
polyvagal theory way discussed people often say, oh
dorsal vagus active tend someone little keyed
people kind state freeze kind flacid kind like just not really
active just lethargic. Well, pathway hypoactive.
active. lot theories psychology maps onto vagus.
far know, don't map real physiology. Now, problem kind
way polyvagal theory discussed probably not real experts,
lot people people start diagnose different psychological physical
manifestations vagus. say things like, Oh person hyper
flexible joints therefore dorsal vagus isn't active enough something like
that. really kind gone way outside lane lines. today gonna clean
lot that. make really simple

00:18:27 Vagus Senses Many Things, & Moves Organs

vagus actually works. least understand today 2021. First
all, mentioned, sensory information way detect light
eyes hear sounds ears, sensors gut sense
full empty gut is. can also sense acidic gut is. can sense
various things within gut. heart same. informing brain
fast heart beating, full lungs communicated
status immune system. way think vagus way
think eyes. eyes looking colors, looking motion
looking bright is. one things, features telling
brain something different. brain can decide awake asleep whether
not looking somebody's attractive unattractive. vagus nerve also
analyzing many features within body informing brain feel
do. really good example think exciting one relates


sugar. know sweet things generally tastes good.

00:19:35 Sugar Sensing Without Perception Sweetness

not particularly fan sweet things. know, much rather cheese
pizza hamburger steak. like savory fatty foods, like sweet foods.
people find sweet foods attractive. want them, might might not
able regulate behavior around them, want them. really
interesting hundreds years people thought
way sweet foods taste. makes sense, right? eat something tastes
sweet. want it. Well, turns much interesting that.
eat something sweet within stomach, cells, neurons,
sense presence sugary foods independent taste signal brain.
sensors, neurons send information vagus brain goes
series stations. release dopamine. molecule makes
want whatever just ingested. fact, pathway
powerful done experiments completely numb taste
feeling somebody's mouth blindfolded. don't know eating
eating food. either sugary not sugary. find
even though people can't taste sugary food crave food contains
sugar sensors gut, sense sugar. put differently,
actually sensors within body make crave sugar independent
sweet taste things. Now incredible. does, tells us
circuits body driving us towards certain behaviors
making us feel good even though can't perceive them. Now,
really interested gut intuition kind gut feelings gut feeling except
chemical gut feeling. particular set neurons detecting something
body particular feature, case presence sugars, sending
information brain essentially control behavior. find remarkable,
means call attractive isn't always coming
thoughts feelings, even perception. drawn particular
foods drawn perhaps also particular people, places things
information coming body. gonna talk
one can information. know many people thoughtful concerned


sugars days thinking ingest much sugar. sugar snuck
things eat. indeed, true. mean, completely reframe way
think sort so-called hidden sugars foods. means
even food savory like piece pizza piece bread even like salad
dressing sugar snuck can't taste will still crave
thing without knowing crave sugar. words,
might find wanting certain foods not knowing want foods.
find fascinating aspect biology yes, relates mood
emotion. talk moment.

00:23:00 Eating-Induced Anxiety

just back bit ask question eat certain things?
certain foods make us feel good? foods actually make us feel anxious.
think people may familiar this. people might not, people
don't realize approach eating anxiety associated that.
alertness. Remember previous discussions, even don't haven't
seen those, moods feelings wellbeing anchored continuum
alertness versus calmness. hear often rest digest. know
that, oh, eat, feel really nice full, hopefully comfortably full not
full. relaxing. feel satiated, associated serotonin molecule
satiation. true. people don't know area
hypothalamus. deepen brain kind middle deep portion brain called
lateral hypothalamus. lateral hypothalamus really interesting
controls feeding, inhibits feeding. stops us feeding. another area
brain. want names, give you. don't want names, just ignore
them, delete memory awareness, called locus coeruleus, now
locus coeruleus sits back brainstem releases norepinephrine
essentially adrenaline. makes us feel alert. Now, locus coeruleus lot
different functions brain, going eat say walk
restaurant, sit preparing meal, locus coeruleus known release
noradrenaline brain. creating kind alertness. ancient utility,
creating alertness. many people, experience approach food
stress anxiety. interesting approach food locus coeruleus


releasing molecules make us feel anxious alert sometimes
felt excitement. asks probably feel food generally,
happy relationship food? trying restrict relationship
food, people coming dinner, will play course,
certain stress anxiety upon approach food. approach food feel
anxiety locus coeruleus activates lateral hypothalamus way inhibits
feeding makes us not want eat. lot people kind pre-meal
anxiety anxiety around food can't seem just calm good
meal access later rest digest. lot heightened
stress upon approach food lot tools there, eating
disorders just kind general public isn't suffering eating disorders,
things like mindfulness around meals. know, always tell never
eat stressed. sorry, life not organized way can that.
never eat. Right eat awake don't know stressed,
don't think tend run around lot day. don't generally take
time two three deep breaths eat. generally will just eat. can
healthy unhealthy depending quality digestion. think using digestion
guide good, lot people aren't aware interaction locus
coeruleus lateral hypothalamus basic mechanism supposed
get little bit alert anxious around mealtime. eat, mechanisms
calming satiation supposed kick mechanisms involve
mentioned earlier, two things. One things taste, digestion starts mouth.
course, taste food. Everyone tells us chew food more. Yes,
can improve digestion. not supposed drink many fluids eat.
true too, lot feel eat eat vagus
sensing gut. sending information time. sugar?
fats? contaminants? lot information. so-called
parallel pathways going brain regulate whether not want
eat something not. accelerators, things make us want
eat more, like sugar fats nutrient dense. helps
generally, least short term

00:27:30 Eat Brain Perceives “Amino Acid Threshold”



support survival animals, also amino acids. important.
lot data, much comes data people eat
much eat subconscious detection many amino acids
array, meaning constellation amino acids given food. fair say
sum total studies pointing direction people will basically eat, not
stomach full brain perceives adequate intake
amino acids. Now, conversation comes context know,
meat, keto, kind zone diet, Mediterranean diet, vegan diet.
largely going ignore kind strict camps today. will talk little bit it,
think one actually taps something important brain
body relationship ones don't. don't want get discussion
ethics different foods animal based non animal based. 'Cause not
topic today. really nutrient sensing amino acid sensing. generally
will eat gut tells brain adequate amounts amino acids.
Amino acids course important building blocks sure,
muscle, things body need repair. people don't
realize amino acids neurochemicals brain made from.
Now, vitally important. Okay, heard dopamine molecule
makes feel good. Actually dopamine molecule makes feel good.
released within brain. feel good dopamine release,
dopamine releases caused surprise, excitement, events looking forward
turnout well, inhibited events looking forward don't work
someone says going call really really excited talk to,
don't, thought movie gonna really great not,
expect meal really delicious. kind of, eh, actually

00:29:45 Reward Prediction Error: Buildup, Letdown Wanting

name that. called reward prediction error. can actually use
context meals plans way useful people
know, essentially expect something really terrific really place higher
expectation chemical level. don't get much dopamine
expecting something, hear really great restaurant place
really, case, have, wouldn't call addiction. call


affliction croissants. best vegetable course, croissant. get really
excited fact someone will tell me, oh place
incredible croissants. gotta go there. get really excited, go. just
telling gonna really terrific raises expectation, dopamine
expectation. unless croissants amazing chances going
experience less good, less satisfying. will truly release less dopamine
just said, oh yeah, think croissants street.
just tried one random, reward prediction error
expectation something releases dopamine actual event releases dopamine.
event related dopamine not exceed expectation least match it,
much higher tendency won't pursue thing again. dopamine
really powerful not just molecule reward. molecule desire.
molecule wanting not just molecule having. book, since people often
ask book recommendations. don't know author personally, love book.
called "The Molecule More". terrific book. wish written it, frankly,
want learn dopamine reward prediction error dopamine
regulates various aspects emotional motivational life, terrific read.
Dopamine going lead us want eat something not want
something, dopamine really craving. motivation
desire. mentioned, amino acid sensors gut detecting
many amino acids

00:32:01 L-Tyrosine, Dopamine, Motivation, Mood, & Movement

also detecting amino acids. particular amino acid called
L-tyrosine comes food. can look online, foods contain L-
tyrosine. meats. nuts. also plant-based foods. L-tyrosine
precursor couple molecules like L-DOPA, et cetera, make dopamine.
misconception serotonin gut.
dopamine gut. therefore mood gut. not quite way
works. Okay. talk serotonin moment dopamine synthesized
amino acids eat. However, dopamine neurons give rise
feelings good wanting desire motivation, reside brain.
don't want get confused. want respect honor power gut


vagal pathway, really neurons within brain drive pursuit
decision-making, mean? Well, people make little dopamine.
people make little dopamine need prescription dopamine. need
L-DOPA, people Parkinson's take L-DOPA compounds increase
dopamine Parkinson's associated deficits movement, starts
tremor, actually starts things interesting. talk
moment, Parkinson's depression. blunting motivation mood
effect, tremor. eventually severe conditions challenges
speaking walking famous examples Muhammad Ali, Michael
J. Fox, great boxing trainer, Freddie Roach, like people Parkinson's
least later life challenges speaking. Now not just fighters
develop Parkinson's far know, Michael J. Fox wasn't fighter. People can
develop Parkinson's Parkinson's depletion dopamine neurons brain.
not just movement challenges.

00:34:04 Supplementing L-Tyrosine, Drugs Abuse, Wellbutrin

challenges mood. Now, hopefully don't Parkinson's,
clear dietary L-tyrosine supports healthy production things like
dopamine well factors within brain. Now, people immediately
ask, well supplement L-tyrosine? just talk
gonna come up. Full disclosure, sometimes take L-tyrosine. not taking right now,
take occasionally, can buy capsule form. increase kind
mood elevation alertness. counter. check
doctor. not responsible healthcare not doctor, whether not
safe you, people preexisting hyper dopaminergic conditions like mania
probably not take L-tyrosine. thing taking L-tyrosine crash,
okay? not massive crash take appropriate doses right
can produce crash lethargy kind brain fog next day so.
L-tyrosine however can ingested foods supplementation
increase dopamine levels. well-known, taken chronically however, can disrupt
dopamine pathways. Now drugs will increase L-tyrosine
dopamine well. severe enough generally tend
addictive properties. things like methamphetamine, things like cocaine terrible


really ramp dopamine system much people really can't
achieve dopamine release mechanisms. food ingestion
L-tyrosine profound effect levels dopamine. takes little
really will impact level mood. Certain antidepressants fall category
dopaminergic antidepressants. One famous ones course Wellbutrin.
Wellbutrin developed lot antidepressants tend make
people feel kind lethargic side effect profiles people didn't like.
developed thing that, generic name different, generally called
Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin activates dopamine epinephrin, substrate
dopamine. involved motivation alertness effort.
might say, wow, sounds like great drug. However, drug, side effect profile
tends things associated elevated mood alertness. isn't
like taking L-tyrosine. isn't like eating tyrosine rich foods. really
much greater release dopamine epinephrin, increases things like anxiety,
sweating, pupils dilate. certain effects on, particular people epilepsy,
used somewhat successfully smoking cessation, again, not
everybody not encourage use things. just describing
biology rationale drugs developed. back
second. just kind take stock at. brain body connection.
many them, one main ones vagus nerve. vagus
collects information lot things, breathing, heart rate stuff happening
gut, et cetera, gut way, includes stomach intestines, sends
information brain. brain using information decide one two
things, move toward something move away. can also pause, essentially pausing
not moving toward. dopamine pathway foods rich L-tyrosine
generally give us elevated mood make us want whatever
happen well things, motivation, generalizes things
not unique just ingesting foods foods give us big pulse dopamine will
make us crave food. will make us crave activity led
ingestion food. mentioned earlier, lot happening
subconscious level not even aware of. think concern
hidden sugars ingestion sugars serious not just
sugars impacting blood glucose negative ways. Although often is, not just
obesity crisis happening. also fact disrupting dopamine


systems. Now doesn't mean sugar bad. people quite healthy
relationship sugar think people just not aware sugar isn't just
operating level taste operating level

00:38:29 Serotonin: Gut, Brain, Satiety Prozac

neurochemicals subconsciously. like talk
pathways brain body regulate moods emotions also
actionable. neuromodulator really interesting context
vagus serotonin. Serotonin, just remind neuromodulator therefore creates
bias neural circuits neurons brain body going active
makes less likely ones going active. think fair say
without ever measured bulldog Costello, just brain body must
swimming serotonin, calm eats lot generally
feels pretty sated. kind animal obsessed comforts. bit
hedonist, serotonin elevated tends make us feel really comfortable
kind blissed wherever are. contrast dopamine epinephrin
mainly put us pursuit things. Motivation pursuit. Serotonin
feeling really comfy are. conversation around brain body relationship
mood serotonin many years was, well, eat big meal. gut
distended. got nutrients need rest digest serotonin
released. sorta true, lot going lot
interesting actionable going on. First all, you, perhaps not
heard 90% serotonin make gut. indeed
lot serotonin gut. neurons gut makes serotonin.
neurons brain make serotonin, deal.
serotonin impacts mood mental state not gut.
neurons brain area called raphae nucleus brain,
locations too, neurons control whether not feel
satiated not. Whether not feel happy calm. can't discussion
serotonin without discussion antidepressants.
late eighties early nineties explosion number prescription
drugs released. Things like first one famous one Prozac, Zoloft
Paxil, number ones so-called SSRI selective serotonin re-uptake


inhibitors. long acronym, basically drugs work preventing
gobbling serotonin re-uptake serotonin neurons released
leads serotonin overall means elevate serotonin. indeed
drugs can useful certain people feel better cases
depression clinical disorders well. really don't want dismiss
useless dangerous everybody. can quite useful many people.
Not everyone responds well sure heard. side effect
profile affects like blunting affect. can make people feel kind flat, kinda meh,
can reduce appetite food. can reduce appetite sex. can sorts things,
can work really well. Sometimes dose-related issue, et cetera. Serotonin
fascinating however, well neurons raphe work impacted
events within gut. Although might surprised find
events are. go little bit deeper gut. again, gut includes
stomach small intestine large intestine ask like, going
serotonin gut? impacting serotonin brain? think
context us might want increase decrease serotonin
levels. far know, aren't really good home blood tests things
like serotonin dopamine. commercial products there. me,
just me, not particularly impressed. know, not getting
hormones levels measured metabolic factors measured, can daunting.
can done rigorously. tests there. even some, believe
not. questionnaires that, think actually last year made
bigger newspapers, dopamine serotonin? that?
find stuff little silly although appreciate, like fact people
thinking talking neuromodulators aren't really great ways
measure things outside clinic. great clinical tools can
get inside hospital proper endocrinologist neurologist, no great at-
home tool. maybe call arms entrepreneurial folks
create tests, accurate tests please, done home.
people feel like anxious always motivated state
trying adjust serotonin. Many people adjust serotonin just eating
food

00:43:38 Eating Promote Dopamine (Daytime) & Serotonin (Night Time)



carbohydrate rich foods will increase serotonin. talked previous
podcast personally big fan least usually fast exercise
early part day eat relatively high protein moderate fat zero carb low carb
meal lunch afternoon stay alert foods tend favor dopamine
production acetylcholine production, epinephrin production alertness. mood
generally pretty good time. evening comes around
concerned sleep good night's sleep, not concerned anxious way,
want get good night's sleep. will ingest foods promote serotonin release
contain lot tryptophan. eat meat, like white
meat, turkey meat. don't tend to, never liked turkey. don't mind animal

00:44:30 Supplementing Serotonin: Sleep, & Caution Sleep Disruptions

don't like ingesting meat, starchy carbohydrates will increase serotonin.
people also will take serotonin. can now buy 5-HTP supplements.
little bit tricky. 5-HTP supplements can course increase 5-HTP. 5-HTP
serotonin sometimes can create problems endogenous self-made
production serotonin. never fan taking things close chemical
trying increase long periods time. Maybe occasional use.
problem take serotonin supplements, 5-HTP, fall asleep. sleep
intense wake three four hours later. know based sleep
studies good measurements lab serotonin release tends later
part night. taking early night really can disrupt pattern
sleep depth sleep. Nonetheless, people interested taking serotonin
get blissed effects. can achieve foods.
mentioned, carbohydrate rich. seeing isn't really discussion
nutrition per se. discussion food contains amino acids, amino
acids precursors neuromodulators neuromodulators profound
effect overall state alertness calmness, happiness, sadness, wellbeing.

00:51:00 Emotional Context Book Recommendation: “How Emotions Made”

going relates emotions. last episode said
something gonna repeat now briefly, much talk


good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman
Podcast. discussions Instagram Live, Northeastern
University, world expert emotions. first book "How Emotions Made"
not book sent me. paid money years ago, bought it, read
it, loved long met Lisa, just delighted got known
little bit. really interesting read psychology emotions
subjectivity emotions. So, whereas talking mainly biology emotions
gets little bit psychology biology well. Lisa's just
terrific. also putting lot information world emotion.
want learn check work, again, Lisa Feldman Barrett.
book "How Emotions Made" Hopefully continue write many
books. now understand relationship hope foods dopamine,
foods serotonin communicated brain via
vagus, right? ingest foods, supplements things people take,
don't put directly brain. put gut. yes, gut
brain connection not serotonin gut makes feel calm
placid. not dopamine gut. just oversold way
think something really attractive. understand idea
certain things experience life emotions happening body.
maybe little control, right? thing hard container.
can't just stuff dopamine there. probably take Mucuna pruriens

serotonin outside. can't get stuff there. ingest
things metabolized certain ways communicate brain maybe
pass brain across called blood brain barrier. talk
blood brain barrier minute. actually called BBB. ends


sounding like baby, BBB. guess like BB, anyway, BBB, also nerves

feel better want more. Oh, got lot bitterness acid taste it.
want less that. transitioned discussion dopamine
serotonin gut hopefully got actionable items belt,
pun intended, can understand certain foods certain nutrients
can look up, might impact mood. somebody really anxious
really wired. Well, dopamine adrenaline pathway epinephrine pathway
probably not one want lean harder. tend someone
pretty passive trouble motivation. Well think ramping
dopamine pathway through, always think behaviors proper food choices
best way start. behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.

00:54:55 Exercise: Powerful Mood Enhancer, Lacks Specificity

eat really matters terms neurochemicals make.

00:56:45 Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil Alleviating Depression

talk little bit things ingest body allow
body inform brain shift mood. something
years. just want say found complete game changer.
excellent science support it. think people familiar different
context don't think people know simple fact omega-3
omega-6 fatty acid ratio profound effect depression. profound effect
mood much double-blind placebo controlled study will provide
link too, study first published 2008 there've many others well.
First all, experiment done animals. found model learned
helplessness animals. not kind animals, put rats mice
jar. let swim swim, swim, swim try save life.
eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially
done humans although didn't swim point near drowning.
took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,
appetite, sorts negative health effects. comparison thousand
milligrams day EPA. EPA one elements contains high levels
omega-3's things like fish oil, talk sources little bit
wasn't thousand milligrams fish oil. thousand milligrams EPA. Compared
20 milligrams Fluoxetine Prozac, okay. Really increases serotonin.
study 60 individuals, again, provide links study. found
equally effective reducing depressive symptoms. imagine that,
food-based compound can't make without, right, not situation
can make omega-3s. get food sources
supplementation, effective 20 milligrams fluoxetine course eight


weeks. really interesting addition combination
thousand milligrams EPA Fluoxetine synergistic effect lowering
depressive symptoms. find remarkable. heard first came
wasn't sure make it. 'Cause lot studies come
generally like focus changes behavior around things large
center mass. lot information. couple years later, fact start taking
thousand milligrams per day EPA fish oil. Now side effects fish
oil. People blood, bleeders Factor V Leiden mutations
women taking birth control, can affect blood clotting things
sort really talk doctor make sure okay you. Fish oil also can give
people fishy breath pretty gross, frankly, now fish oils either
Encapsulations put lemon flavoring
doesn't effect. event, thousand milligrams per day EPA. started
ingesting regularly. just felt better. wasn't clinically depressed, generally,
feel least me, increase mood affect. number things
supposed reduce inflammation. cardiovascular effects controversial long
time everyone thought effects platelets really terrific.
articles came major newspapers saying maybe not much effects
mood really profound. now lots studies.

01:01:00 Fish Oil Antidepressant

go PubMed put EPA fish oil depression find
number really impressive results showing least

effect low dosages SSRIs. feel like people
know this. nutrition, profoundly affecting mood depression
terrible, right? Depression can component anxiety cases
people feel lousy uncertain. kind talk depression
anxiety talk someone anxious can tell everything's
gonna okay. always concerned might not know.

pretty hard get food although can done depending
eating. interesting heart effects solid really stand
literature lot something talked previous episode.
mention again, heart rate variability. know heart rate
really high heart rate, really low. Neither good. lot people
think, oh just want low heart rate, big stroke volume. know, running
lot may 30 40 beats per minute. great shape still want
heart rate variability. lot tone autonomic nervous system
talked last time. How, inhale, speeds heart rate. exhale,
decreases heart rate. called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. basis

way high omega-6 three ratio, not enough omega-3s, not
markers inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 TNF-alpha,
tend non-responders antidepressants. Shifting omega-3 omega-6 ratio
couple things. First all, increasing amount EPA shifted ratio.


higher omega-3 omega-6 ratio, good, lowered inflammation markers,
allowed antidepressants effect, even low doses.
really interesting thing. worked increasing heart rate variability, think, well,
world happen? know mean, ton effects
way works way things impacting gut
autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, said, vagus includes connections
heart signaling sensory information fast heart beating

adjusts heart rate heart rate variability. incredible way one
can use gut, ingestion EPA's, either food
supplementation increase rate variability thereby improve symptoms, meaning
reduce symptoms depression, even make low levels antidepressants
wouldn't otherwise work work. think like study much a, super
cool. bridges brain body access. incorporates nutrition micronutrients
brain also really points something hear time,
body whole system. working whole system brain isn't working
isolation skull. reacting things happening body
gut heart rate heart rate variability. things ingest can
profound effect them. Now, course, really want emphasize something
no one compound nutrient supplement drug behavior

01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either
food supplementation. acknowledge not everyone wants take fish oil.
couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment
makes not want ingest fish related products. krill oil. Krill still
organism. little tiny thing whales eat lot people generally eat little
of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.
preference. people really like krill oil source omega-3s. mention
sources like chia seeds flax seeds, notice
not things tend ingest lot regular basis. possible get omega-3s
meats. animals grazed grasses contain lot omega-3s.
ingest meat source meat gonna important
relates omega-3s. Even within category fish oil concern
sometimes mercury contaminants. want go brand

whether not fish oil rancid not. people take liquid form.
people take capsule form. liquid form gonna affordable. capsule
form little easier little portable. can actually just chew one
gel tablets. tastes really fishy kind rancid, know disgusting.
want spit out. doesn't tolerable know okay.
Unfortunately buy first order that. Although, don't know, maybe
can get open bottle store tell want try


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall

good mood, great digestion great immune system function. However,
not mean maxing taking probiotic prebiotic can
possibly manage. mentioned many times believe probiotics, take
probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues

brain body relationship discussed lot mechanisms
actionable items can approach want explore aspect biology
psychology further. Last, certainly not least, want thank everybody
time attention today, always, thank interest science.


bacteria things invading body. sends information brain.
two-way street sensory information going brain.
vagus. like super highway sensory information going one way
direction motor control. vagus not just sensing things. actually
controlling things. got sensory pathway motor pathway. first
thing think everyone know vagus. fact, important feel
like important people knowing walking involves flexors extensors.
don't think important, important walking, frankly,
vagus way can govern brain body connection.
can steer various aspects mood wellbeing, people just don't
understand use it. first got understand is. got sensory
information coming different organs body brain. got
motor information going brain back body. got super
highway within you. Now actually regulates vagus. Oftentimes hear things
like, oh particular behavior

00:15:45 “Vagus Stimulation”: Terrible Concept

rubbing face particular location breathing particular way, warm bath
something stimulates vagus. Well, right now, want everyone know that, quote
unquote, stimulating vagus broadly speaking terrible way think
vagus know what, contaminant inside body vagus
senses projects information brain, start generate fever
start try kill contaminant body. don't know want
stimulate vagus just general theme today, going get specific
can activate particular circuits, certain pathways certain organs brain
order feel better relieve certain conditions. certainly don't want just
stimulate vagus.

00:16:35 Polyvagal Theory

Now excitement vagus part quite honestly, fairly
pioneering theory vagus polyvagal theory. polyvagal, word
poly means many, cool acknowledges vagus lot different


branches. not just one thing. really liked that. liked naming polyvagal.
idea Porges put forward dorsal vagus, kind
runs back spinal cord, involved alertness activation kind
fight flight type stuff. ventral pathway involved
kind empathic behaviors. not quite agreement modern
anatomy, best time. So, okay. problem
polyvagal theory way discussed people often say, oh
dorsal vagus active tend someone little keyed
people kind state freeze kind flacid kind like just not really
active just lethargic. Well, pathway hypoactive.
active. lot theories psychology maps onto vagus.
far know, don't map real physiology. Now, problem kind
way polyvagal theory discussed probably not real experts,
lot people people start diagnose different psychological physical
manifestations vagus. say things like, Oh person hyper
flexible joints therefore dorsal vagus isn't active enough something like
that. really kind gone way outside lane lines. today gonna clean
lot that. make really simple

00:18:27 Vagus Senses Many Things, & Moves Organs

vagus actually works. least understand today 2021. First
all, mentioned, sensory information way detect light
eyes hear sounds ears, sensors gut sense
full empty gut is. can also sense acidic gut is. can sense
various things within gut. heart same. informing brain
fast heart beating, full lungs communicated
status immune system. way think vagus way
think eyes. eyes looking colors, looking motion
looking bright is. one things, features telling
brain something different. brain can decide awake asleep whether
not looking somebody's attractive unattractive. vagus nerve also
analyzing many features within body informing brain feel
do. really good example think exciting one relates


sugar. know sweet things generally tastes good.

00:19:35 Sugar Sensing Without Perception Sweetness

not particularly fan sweet things. know, much rather cheese
pizza hamburger steak. like savory fatty foods, like sweet foods.
people find sweet foods attractive. want them, might might not
able regulate behavior around them, want them. really
interesting hundreds years people thought
way sweet foods taste. makes sense, right? eat something tastes
sweet. want it. Well, turns much interesting that.
eat something sweet within stomach, cells, neurons,
sense presence sugary foods independent taste signal brain.
sensors, neurons send information vagus brain goes
series stations. release dopamine. molecule makes
want whatever just ingested. fact, pathway
powerful done experiments completely numb taste
feeling somebody's mouth blindfolded. don't know eating
eating food. either sugary not sugary. find
even though people can't taste sugary food crave food contains
sugar sensors gut, sense sugar. put differently,
actually sensors within body make crave sugar independent
sweet taste things. Now incredible. does, tells us
circuits body driving us towards certain behaviors
making us feel good even though can't perceive them. Now,
really interested gut intuition kind gut feelings gut feeling except
chemical gut feeling. particular set neurons detecting something
body particular feature, case presence sugars, sending
information brain essentially control behavior. find remarkable,
means call attractive isn't always coming
thoughts feelings, even perception. drawn particular
foods drawn perhaps also particular people, places things
information coming body. gonna talk
one can information. know many people thoughtful concerned


sugars days thinking ingest much sugar. sugar snuck
things eat. indeed, true. mean, completely reframe way
think sort so-called hidden sugars foods. means
even food savory like piece pizza piece bread even like salad
dressing sugar snuck can't taste will still crave
thing without knowing crave sugar. words,
might find wanting certain foods not knowing want foods.
find fascinating aspect biology yes, relates mood
emotion. talk moment.

00:23:00 Eating-Induced Anxiety

just back bit ask question eat certain things?
certain foods make us feel good? foods actually make us feel anxious.
think people may familiar this. people might not, people
don't realize approach eating anxiety associated that.
alertness. Remember previous discussions, even don't haven't
seen those, moods feelings wellbeing anchored continuum
alertness versus calmness. hear often rest digest. know
that, oh, eat, feel really nice full, hopefully comfortably full not
full. relaxing. feel satiated, associated serotonin molecule
satiation. true. people don't know area
hypothalamus. deepen brain kind middle deep portion brain called
lateral hypothalamus. lateral hypothalamus really interesting
controls feeding, inhibits feeding. stops us feeding. another area
brain. want names, give you. don't want names, just ignore
them, delete memory awareness, called locus coeruleus, now
locus coeruleus sits back brainstem releases norepinephrine
essentially adrenaline. makes us feel alert. Now, locus coeruleus lot
different functions brain, going eat say walk
restaurant, sit preparing meal, locus coeruleus known release
noradrenaline brain. creating kind alertness. ancient utility,
creating alertness. many people, experience approach food
stress anxiety. interesting approach food locus coeruleus


releasing molecules make us feel anxious alert sometimes
felt excitement. asks probably feel food generally,
happy relationship food? trying restrict relationship
food, people coming dinner, will play course,
certain stress anxiety upon approach food. approach food feel
anxiety locus coeruleus activates lateral hypothalamus way inhibits
feeding makes us not want eat. lot people kind pre-meal
anxiety anxiety around food can't seem just calm good
meal access later rest digest. lot heightened
stress upon approach food lot tools there, eating
disorders just kind general public isn't suffering eating disorders,
things like mindfulness around meals. know, always tell never
eat stressed. sorry, life not organized way can that.
never eat. Right eat awake don't know stressed,
don't think tend run around lot day. don't generally take
time two three deep breaths eat. generally will just eat. can
healthy unhealthy depending quality digestion. think using digestion
guide good, lot people aren't aware interaction locus
coeruleus lateral hypothalamus basic mechanism supposed
get little bit alert anxious around mealtime. eat, mechanisms
calming satiation supposed kick mechanisms involve
mentioned earlier, two things. One things taste, digestion starts mouth.
course, taste food. Everyone tells us chew food more. Yes,
can improve digestion. not supposed drink many fluids eat.
true too, lot feel eat eat vagus
sensing gut. sending information time. sugar?
fats? contaminants? lot information. so-called
parallel pathways going brain regulate whether not want
eat something not. accelerators, things make us want
eat more, like sugar fats nutrient dense. helps
generally, least short term

00:27:30 Eat Brain Perceives “Amino Acid Threshold”



support survival animals, also amino acids. important.
lot data, much comes data people eat
much eat subconscious detection many amino acids
array, meaning constellation amino acids given food. fair say
sum total studies pointing direction people will basically eat, not
stomach full brain perceives adequate intake
amino acids. Now, conversation comes context know,
meat, keto, kind zone diet, Mediterranean diet, vegan diet.
largely going ignore kind strict camps today. will talk little bit it,
think one actually taps something important brain
body relationship ones don't. don't want get discussion
ethics different foods animal based non animal based. 'Cause not
topic today. really nutrient sensing amino acid sensing. generally
will eat gut tells brain adequate amounts amino acids.
Amino acids course important building blocks sure,
muscle, things body need repair. people don't
realize amino acids neurochemicals brain made from.
Now, vitally important. Okay, heard dopamine molecule
makes feel good. Actually dopamine molecule makes feel good.
released within brain. feel good dopamine release,
dopamine releases caused surprise, excitement, events looking forward
turnout well, inhibited events looking forward don't work
someone says going call really really excited talk to,
don't, thought movie gonna really great not,
expect meal really delicious. kind of, eh, actually

00:29:45 Reward Prediction Error: Buildup, Letdown Wanting

name that. called reward prediction error. can actually use
context meals plans way useful people
know, essentially expect something really terrific really place higher
expectation chemical level. don't get much dopamine
expecting something, hear really great restaurant place
really, case, have, wouldn't call addiction. call


affliction croissants. best vegetable course, croissant. get really
excited fact someone will tell me, oh place
incredible croissants. gotta go there. get really excited, go. just
telling gonna really terrific raises expectation, dopamine
expectation. unless croissants amazing chances going
experience less good, less satisfying. will truly release less dopamine
just said, oh yeah, think croissants street.
just tried one random, reward prediction error
expectation something releases dopamine actual event releases dopamine.
event related dopamine not exceed expectation least match it,
much higher tendency won't pursue thing again. dopamine
really powerful not just molecule reward. molecule desire.
molecule wanting not just molecule having. book, since people often
ask book recommendations. don't know author personally, love book.
called "The Molecule More". terrific book. wish written it, frankly,
want learn dopamine reward prediction error dopamine
regulates various aspects emotional motivational life, terrific read.
Dopamine going lead us want eat something not want
something, dopamine really craving. motivation
desire. mentioned, amino acid sensors gut detecting
many amino acids

00:32:01 L-Tyrosine, Dopamine, Motivation, Mood, & Movement

also detecting amino acids. particular amino acid called
L-tyrosine comes food. can look online, foods contain L-
tyrosine. meats. nuts. also plant-based foods. L-tyrosine
precursor couple molecules like L-DOPA, et cetera, make dopamine.
misconception serotonin gut.
dopamine gut. therefore mood gut. not quite way
works. Okay. talk serotonin moment dopamine synthesized
amino acids eat. However, dopamine neurons give rise
feelings good wanting desire motivation, reside brain.
don't want get confused. want respect honor power gut


vagal pathway, really neurons within brain drive pursuit
decision-making, mean? Well, people make little dopamine.
people make little dopamine need prescription dopamine. need
L-DOPA, people Parkinson's take L-DOPA compounds increase
dopamine Parkinson's associated deficits movement, starts
tremor, actually starts things interesting. talk
moment, Parkinson's depression. blunting motivation mood
effect, tremor. eventually severe conditions challenges
speaking walking famous examples Muhammad Ali, Michael
J. Fox, great boxing trainer, Freddie Roach, like people Parkinson's
least later life challenges speaking. Now not just fighters
develop Parkinson's far know, Michael J. Fox wasn't fighter. People can
develop Parkinson's Parkinson's depletion dopamine neurons brain.
not just movement challenges.

00:34:04 Supplementing L-Tyrosine, Drugs Abuse, Wellbutrin

challenges mood. Now, hopefully don't Parkinson's,
clear dietary L-tyrosine supports healthy production things like
dopamine well factors within brain. Now, people immediately
ask, well supplement L-tyrosine? just talk
gonna come up. Full disclosure, sometimes take L-tyrosine. not taking right now,
take occasionally, can buy capsule form. increase kind
mood elevation alertness. counter. check
doctor. not responsible healthcare not doctor, whether not
safe you, people preexisting hyper dopaminergic conditions like mania
probably not take L-tyrosine. thing taking L-tyrosine crash,
okay? not massive crash take appropriate doses right
can produce crash lethargy kind brain fog next day so.
L-tyrosine however can ingested foods supplementation
increase dopamine levels. well-known, taken chronically however, can disrupt
dopamine pathways. Now drugs will increase L-tyrosine
dopamine well. severe enough generally tend
addictive properties. things like methamphetamine, things like cocaine terrible


really ramp dopamine system much people really can't
achieve dopamine release mechanisms. food ingestion
L-tyrosine profound effect levels dopamine. takes little
really will impact level mood. Certain antidepressants fall category
dopaminergic antidepressants. One famous ones course Wellbutrin.
Wellbutrin developed lot antidepressants tend make
people feel kind lethargic side effect profiles people didn't like.
developed thing that, generic name different, generally called
Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin activates dopamine epinephrin, substrate
dopamine. involved motivation alertness effort.
might say, wow, sounds like great drug. However, drug, side effect profile
tends things associated elevated mood alertness. isn't
like taking L-tyrosine. isn't like eating tyrosine rich foods. really
much greater release dopamine epinephrin, increases things like anxiety,
sweating, pupils dilate. certain effects on, particular people epilepsy,
used somewhat successfully smoking cessation, again, not
everybody not encourage use things. just describing
biology rationale drugs developed. back
second. just kind take stock at. brain body connection.
many them, one main ones vagus nerve. vagus
collects information lot things, breathing, heart rate stuff happening
gut, et cetera, gut way, includes stomach intestines, sends
information brain. brain using information decide one two
things, move toward something move away. can also pause, essentially pausing
not moving toward. dopamine pathway foods rich L-tyrosine
generally give us elevated mood make us want whatever
happen well things, motivation, generalizes things
not unique just ingesting foods foods give us big pulse dopamine will
make us crave food. will make us crave activity led
ingestion food. mentioned earlier, lot happening
subconscious level not even aware of. think concern
hidden sugars ingestion sugars serious not just
sugars impacting blood glucose negative ways. Although often is, not just
obesity crisis happening. also fact disrupting dopamine


systems. Now doesn't mean sugar bad. people quite healthy
relationship sugar think people just not aware sugar isn't just
operating level taste operating level

00:38:29 Serotonin: Gut, Brain, Satiety Prozac

neurochemicals subconsciously. like talk
pathways brain body regulate moods emotions also
actionable. neuromodulator really interesting context
vagus serotonin. Serotonin, just remind neuromodulator therefore creates
bias neural circuits neurons brain body going active
makes less likely ones going active. think fair say
without ever measured bulldog Costello, just brain body must
swimming serotonin, calm eats lot generally
feels pretty sated. kind animal obsessed comforts. bit
hedonist, serotonin elevated tends make us feel really comfortable
kind blissed wherever are. contrast dopamine epinephrin
mainly put us pursuit things. Motivation pursuit. Serotonin
feeling really comfy are. conversation around brain body relationship
mood serotonin many years was, well, eat big meal. gut
distended. got nutrients need rest digest serotonin
released. sorta true, lot going lot
interesting actionable going on. First all, you, perhaps not
heard 90% serotonin make gut. indeed
lot serotonin gut. neurons gut makes serotonin.
neurons brain make serotonin, deal.
serotonin impacts mood mental state not gut.
neurons brain area called raphae nucleus brain,
locations too, neurons control whether not feel
satiated not. Whether not feel happy calm. can't discussion
serotonin without discussion antidepressants.
late eighties early nineties explosion number prescription
drugs released. Things like first one famous one Prozac, Zoloft
Paxil, number ones so-called SSRI selective serotonin re-uptake


inhibitors. long acronym, basically drugs work preventing
gobbling serotonin re-uptake serotonin neurons released
leads serotonin overall means elevate serotonin. indeed
drugs can useful certain people feel better cases
depression clinical disorders well. really don't want dismiss
useless dangerous everybody. can quite useful many people.
Not everyone responds well sure heard. side effect
profile affects like blunting affect. can make people feel kind flat, kinda meh,
can reduce appetite food. can reduce appetite sex. can sorts things,
can work really well. Sometimes dose-related issue, et cetera. Serotonin
fascinating however, well neurons raphe work impacted
events within gut. Although might surprised find
events are. go little bit deeper gut. again, gut includes
stomach small intestine large intestine ask like, going
serotonin gut? impacting serotonin brain? think
context us might want increase decrease serotonin
levels. far know, aren't really good home blood tests things
like serotonin dopamine. commercial products there. me,
just me, not particularly impressed. know, not getting
hormones levels measured metabolic factors measured, can daunting.
can done rigorously. tests there. even some, believe
not. questionnaires that, think actually last year made
bigger newspapers, dopamine serotonin? that?
find stuff little silly although appreciate, like fact people
thinking talking neuromodulators aren't really great ways
measure things outside clinic. great clinical tools can
get inside hospital proper endocrinologist neurologist, no great at-
home tool. maybe call arms entrepreneurial folks
create tests, accurate tests please, done home.
people feel like anxious always motivated state
trying adjust serotonin. Many people adjust serotonin just eating
food

00:43:38 Eating Promote Dopamine (Daytime) & Serotonin (Night Time)



carbohydrate rich foods will increase serotonin. talked previous
podcast personally big fan least usually fast exercise
early part day eat relatively high protein moderate fat zero carb low carb
meal lunch afternoon stay alert foods tend favor dopamine
production acetylcholine production, epinephrin production alertness. mood
generally pretty good time. evening comes around
concerned sleep good night's sleep, not concerned anxious way,
want get good night's sleep. will ingest foods promote serotonin release
contain lot tryptophan. eat meat, like white
meat, turkey meat. don't tend to, never liked turkey. don't mind animal

00:44:30 Supplementing Serotonin: Sleep, & Caution Sleep Disruptions

don't like ingesting meat, starchy carbohydrates will increase serotonin.
people also will take serotonin. can now buy 5-HTP supplements.
little bit tricky. 5-HTP supplements can course increase 5-HTP. 5-HTP
serotonin sometimes can create problems endogenous self-made
production serotonin. never fan taking things close chemical
trying increase long periods time. Maybe occasional use.
problem take serotonin supplements, 5-HTP, fall asleep. sleep
intense wake three four hours later. know based sleep
studies good measurements lab serotonin release tends later
part night. taking early night really can disrupt pattern
sleep depth sleep. Nonetheless, people interested taking serotonin
get blissed effects. can achieve foods.
mentioned, carbohydrate rich. seeing isn't really discussion

calm. Now whole month emotion. might thinking, well, wait

00:51:00 Emotional Context Book Recommendation: “How Emotions Made”

going relates emotions. last episode said
something gonna repeat now briefly, much talk


good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman
Podcast. discussions Instagram Live, Northeastern
University, world expert emotions. first book "How Emotions Made"
not book sent me. paid money years ago, bought it, read
it, loved long met Lisa, just delighted got known
little bit. really interesting read psychology emotions
subjectivity emotions. So, whereas talking mainly biology emotions
gets little bit psychology biology well. Lisa's just
terrific. also putting lot information world emotion.
want learn check work, again, Lisa Feldman Barrett.
book "How Emotions Made" Hopefully continue write many
books. now understand relationship hope foods dopamine,
foods serotonin communicated brain via
vagus, right? ingest foods, supplements things people take,
don't put directly brain. put gut. yes, gut
brain connection not serotonin gut makes feel calm
placid. not dopamine gut. just oversold way
think something really attractive. understand idea
certain things experience life emotions happening body.
maybe little control, right? thing hard container.
can't just stuff dopamine there. probably take Mucuna pruriens
bean stuff ear, please don't that. It'd make ear itchy
serotonin outside. can't get stuff there. ingest
things metabolized certain ways communicate brain maybe
pass brain across called blood brain barrier. talk
blood brain barrier minute. actually called BBB. ends


sounding like baby, BBB. guess like BB, anyway, BBB, also nerves
gut sensing nutrient contents food saying, oh,
feel better want more. Oh, got lot bitterness acid taste it.
want less that. transitioned discussion dopamine
serotonin gut hopefully got actionable items belt,
pun intended, can understand certain foods certain nutrients
can look up, might impact mood. somebody really anxious
really wired. Well, dopamine adrenaline pathway epinephrine pathway
probably not one want lean harder. tend someone
pretty passive trouble motivation. Well think ramping
dopamine pathway through, always think behaviors proper food choices
best way start. behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.

00:54:55 Exercise: Powerful Mood Enhancer, Lacks Specificity

one problems discussion around mood exercise mood
meditation subjective. like, love certain forms exercise not
others. Certain ones aversive me. Certain ones attractive me, never
really clear. No one's ever told me. Okay, 10 minutes bike X
number RPM so-and-so skier order get dopamine up.
can actually say, ingest L-tyrosine high probability going
make dopamine. talking ingesting food
supplementation like. Mucuna pruriens, tried. just mention
dopaminergic me. got really, really jazzed severe crash
next day. that's, think tend ride pretty high kind alertness
motivation scale. always told Costello people podcast
studio slow speech down. uncaffeinated, probably afford
little serotonin life. So, whereas Costello, can afford wake every
couple days just say hello us. dog sleeps creature.
remarkable. things can actionable.
ways quantitative can regulate dosages can
regulate amounts can regulate timing. everyone play
things figure right terms feeding. everyone
explore understand safe right them. But, course, exercise


still important. talked social connection last episode super important
activation serotonin comes gut brain, body brain relationship,
eat really matters terms neurochemicals make.

00:56:45 Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil Alleviating Depression

talk little bit things ingest body allow
body inform brain shift mood. something
years. just want say found complete game changer.
excellent science support it. think people familiar different
context don't think people know simple fact omega-3
omega-6 fatty acid ratio profound effect depression. profound effect
mood much double-blind placebo controlled study will provide
link too, study first published 2008 there've many others well.
First all, experiment done animals. found model learned
helplessness animals. not kind animals, put rats mice
jar. let swim swim, swim, swim try save life.
eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially
done humans although didn't swim point near drowning.
took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,
appetite, sorts negative health effects. comparison thousand
milligrams day EPA. EPA one elements contains high levels
omega-3's things like fish oil, talk sources little bit
wasn't thousand milligrams fish oil. thousand milligrams EPA. Compared
20 milligrams Fluoxetine Prozac, okay. Really increases serotonin.
study 60 individuals, again, provide links study. found
equally effective reducing depressive symptoms. imagine that,
food-based compound can't make without, right, not situation
can make omega-3s. get food sources
supplementation, effective 20 milligrams fluoxetine course eight


weeks. really interesting addition combination
thousand milligrams EPA Fluoxetine synergistic effect lowering

thousand milligrams per day EPA fish oil. Now side effects fish
oil. People blood, bleeders Factor V Leiden mutations

people fishy breath pretty gross, frankly, now fish oils either
Encapsulations put lemon flavoring

ingesting regularly. just felt better. wasn't clinically depressed, generally,
feel least me, increase mood affect. number things
supposed reduce inflammation. cardiovascular effects controversial long
time everyone thought effects platelets really terrific.
articles came major newspapers saying maybe not much effects
mood really profound. now lots studies.

01:01:00 Fish Oil Antidepressant

go PubMed put EPA fish oil depression find
number really impressive results showing least

way high omega-6 three ratio, not enough omega-3s, not
markers inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 TNF-alpha,
tend non-responders antidepressants. Shifting omega-3 omega-6 ratio
couple things. First all, increasing amount EPA shifted ratio.


higher omega-3 omega-6 ratio, good, lowered inflammation markers,
allowed antidepressants effect, even low doses.
really interesting thing. worked increasing heart rate variability, think, well,
world happen? know mean, ton effects
way works way things impacting gut
autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, said, vagus includes connections
heart signaling sensory information fast heart beating
brain not just stuff lungs, information heart brain
adjusts heart rate heart rate variability. incredible way one
can use gut, ingestion EPA's, either food
supplementation increase rate variability thereby improve symptoms, meaning
reduce symptoms depression, even make low levels antidepressants
wouldn't otherwise work work. think like study much a, super
cool. bridges brain body access. incorporates nutrition micronutrients
brain also really points something hear time,
body whole system. working whole system brain isn't working
isolation skull. reacting things happening body
gut heart rate heart rate variability. things ingest can
profound effect them. Now, course, really want emphasize something
no one compound nutrient supplement drug behavior
matter going end shifting depression improving one's
mood improving sleep. constellation things. especially true
people start get excited supplements drugs kinds potential
various things. Right now, lot excitement psychedelics
therapeutic uses. think great, good friend mine physician
clinician says better living chemistry still requires better living. cannot
expect take compound regardless source potency completely shift
experience life without continue engage proper behaviors,
things know proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.
many others well. still find collection studies omega-3
omega-6 ratios profoundly important much completely changed
way think food, foods eat, supplement. don't necessarily think
everybody really think incredible compounds
robust effects feelings wellbeing.



01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either
food supplementation. acknowledge not everyone wants take fish oil.
couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment
makes not want ingest fish related products. krill oil. Krill still
organism. little tiny thing whales eat lot people generally eat little
of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.
preference. people really like krill oil source omega-3s. mention
sources like chia seeds flax seeds, notice
not things tend ingest lot regular basis. possible get omega-3s
meats. animals grazed grasses contain lot omega-3s.
ingest meat source meat gonna important
relates omega-3s. Even within category fish oil concern
sometimes mercury contaminants. want go brand
emphasizes gone really good sources decontaminate
regardless. search brands. test can


01:09:05 L-Carnitine Mood, Sperm Ovary Quality, Autism, Fibromyalgia,
Migraine

whether not fish oil rancid not. people take liquid form.
people take capsule form. liquid form gonna affordable. capsule
form little easier little portable. can actually just chew one
gel tablets. tastes really fishy kind rancid, know disgusting.
want spit out. doesn't tolerable know okay.
Unfortunately buy first order that. Although, don't know, maybe
can get open bottle store tell want try


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall
around brain barrier brain important.
feature neurons don't recreate injury, like
organs body. not lot turnover cells despite might've
heard. nature created BBB, blood brain barrier make sure
certain molecules particular, large molecules don't get across blood-brain barrier.
'Cause can damaging tissues. Incidentally, also rigid
stringent barrier around organs, gonads. ovaries
testes brain organs body nature gone way
protect, give additional layer blood-brain barrier might imagine
testes ovaries, going blood gonadal barrier. barriers
exist make just eat something, just ingest
doesn't mean going cross blood-brain barrier, L-carnitine taken
acetylated converted form gets across blood-brain barrier.
lot effects, involved mitochondrial activation long chain fatty acids
big mouthful, get time talking metabolic,
interesting effects neuro side. decide check
examine.com see really interesting things, lots effects ammonia, C-


reactive proteins, things sort, blood glucose lowered, et cetera. stuff
level blood periphery, slight effects lowering cholesterol.
interesting ones. Rates pregnancy go way people taking L-carnitine
father mother source sperm source egg affected
ways favors pregnancy. increase, go sperm quality
sperm motility males seems positive effects females
polycystic ovary syndrome. check out. know, effects strong.
three studies listed there. Again, not promoting this, people
take L-carnitine, especially trying get pregnant check
effects studies mentioned published peer reviewed rigorous
journals. terms neural effects. quite interesting. effects
depression still emerging seem exist people feel notable
decrease depressive symptoms. seven studies listed examine.com
notable benefit variety circumstances participants heightened
depression already. start taking L-carnitine start feeling better.
talk dosages various studies. also shown notable
decrease symptoms autism, find fascinating. Also again, things
ingest impact chemicals brain impact rest body.
things used treat certain forms alcohol dependence.
think going exciting emerging area. gonna whole month
addiction. got great guest lined month, now
emerging field people can take supplement help ease cravings
withdrawal trying quit drugs abuse, like cocaine, alcohol, heroin,
smoking things sort. really interesting area. is, like think
early days gonna discover lot more. huge list things here. Since
talked pain previous episode know lot people written
fibromyalgia. L carnitine shown reduce symptoms
fibromyalgia. Again, links studies examine.com, totally free site.
bulldog battering ram. nothing graceful bulldog.
decided wanted leave go get drink water. please forgive noise.
Okay. now turn another aspect gut-brain relationship will surprise
you, cases might shock you. really cool actionable
biology. gut microbiome, probiotics prebiotics. know today
talking emotions not pain remiss didn't mention another effect


acetylcarnitine reported can find listed link study
examine.com effect reducing symptoms migraine.
randomized controlled trial 133 participants frequent migraines.
taking 500 milligrams L-carnitine nothing 12 weeks. control little bit,
control experiment little bit tricky significant effect reducing
number migraine attacks per month. find really interesting
lot listed study. think compounds powerful.
carry risks certain people, not others. again, find right


01:16:29 Gut-Microbiome: Myths, Truths & Tubes Within Us

think super interesting potential therapeutics various people.
deal gut microbiome gut brain axis. Today actually
talking lot already gut brain axis nothing
microbiomes. talking vagus nerve connects providing
sensory information body brain. brain also sends
nerve motor information control motility got heart rate fast
breathe deployment immune stuff killer cells things sort.
oftentimes hear gut brain axis days, discussion
gut microbiome. again, situation incredible biology,
happy much discussion gut microbiome. somewhat
dismayed concerned hear either false partially
false. gonna clear misconceptions, first understanding
biology. going talk actionable items. true
lot little microorganisms living gut. not
want help us. don't brains, adaptive however, try
find create environments make easier proliferate. don't
care perfectly willing exploit order
make way viruses are, viruses don't mind,
infect cells, hijack genome, use genome make
themselves. microbiota live us vary along length digestive tract.
just take step back think body plan made. actually
series tubes. brain actually tube. see, squishy outside.


got long thing. spinal cord goes base spine.
central nervous system started tube. just looks like
cauliflower end brain tube big
crammed skull. gets wrinkled up. splay find
just one big tube. Similarly, digestive tract airways essentially
one big tube. starts mouth, also nose.
tubes. go throat stomach
various intestines. tube ends end. one long tube
digestion. inside tube mucosal lining. little microvilli, tiny,
tiny, tiny little like velvety ends cells able move move things along

things. sets rate digestion quality digestion. sets
instance, immune system. people probably don't realize this,
infections environment get body somehow.
inhaled. lot go mouth lodge mucosal lining mouth.
infection start there. probably experience, unfortunately,
know, feeling like tick throat, like something's irritating throat.
kind migrates head cold runny nose. Sometimes it'll start
headache. Sometimes won't, things inert can migrate gut.
ingesting things time. Think air, bacteria, viruses, making
way gut. bacteria live gut. bacteria
bias mucosal lining gut, stomach intestines acidic
basic can make can replicate. like
particular comfort. like like particular kind bedding lie create

us feel better. make us feel alert. bolster immune system
others make us feel worse. first rule, microbiome isn't good bad.
little bugs live us bad things us. make us feel worse. lower
immunity. affect us negative ways. make us feel better
mainly changing conditions gut environment. addition
that, impact neurotransmitters neurons live gut.
signal brain impact things like dopamine serotonin
talking previously. vast world now devoted try understand
sources food kinds foods good not good gut microbiome?


just talk general rules thumb related research quality research
peer reviewed. future episode

01:21:55 Probiotics, Brain Fog, Autism, Fermentation

will go far deeper gut microbiome gut brain axis. things
think might find surprising. First all, supporting healthy gut microbiome
good mood, great digestion great immune system function. However,
not mean maxing taking probiotic prebiotic can
possibly manage. mentioned many times believe probiotics, take
probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case
better. things like brain fog can come that, brain fog just
inability focus. People feel really not well generally. studies
little bit controversial think fair say people really increase amount
probiotic taking beyond certain amount start feeling foggy
mind. Now much? Well get probiotics mentioned Athletic
Greens, can get fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,
different sources around world. Actually, love hear
sources people know foods around world. fascinated
way different cultures arrived foods provide support
healthy microbiomes fermented. colleague Stanford, Justin
Sonnenberg, talked this. don't want quote
inappropriately, discussions it, published
ingestion fermented foods one best ways support healthy levels gut
microbiota without exceeding threshold cause things like brain fog.
foods fermented foods going best source. number
different ways one that. people don't like fermented foods, however
people supplement it. isn't case better. know that.
true healthy gut microbiota shown improve symptoms
certain psychiatric illnesses well certain conditions like particular features along
autism spectrum, interesting. effects probably due not just
improvement immune system function, conditions neurons
sense nutrients convey information brain increase levels serotonin


dopamine. gut microbiome provides kind foundation healthy gut
healthy gut brain access much people report start eating
small bits 'cause doesn't require lot fermented foods, overall mood
better, not unlike effects EPA. Although don't think looked directly
context clinical depression yet. someone knows study please mention
comments. terrific. things can really
damage gut microbiome. huge misconception want
clear up. study published "Nature", among three
top journals science. know, "Nature", "Science"

01:25:20 Artificial Sweeteners & Gut Microbiome: NOT Bad; Depends!

"Cell" considered top tops, excellent journal showed artificial
sweeteners particular artificial sweetener saccharin can disrupt gut
microbiome ways detrimental number different health markers,
increasing inflammatory cytokines bad things happen gut
microbiome thrown off kilter. study widely discussed
things not mentioned really important. study
saccharin particular. Saccharin not typical artificial sweetener used,
typical artificial sweeteners used things like aspartame, so-called
NutraSweet Sucralose, days Stevia, monk fruits, knowledge
please correct anyone knows studies, knowledge, negative
effects artificial sweeteners gut microbiome restricted saccharin.
Now enough chemical similarity saccharin ones
mentioned, not them. instance, Stevia, monk fruit distinct
chemical makeup probably don't any, lower effects,
negative effects gut microbiome, still tested. saccharin
really, shown study several studies can really negatively impact
quality gut microbiome. Interestingly, narrative around artificial sweeteners
gut microbiome incorrect. people thought, oh, saccharin bad
microbiome. must kill microbiome. hear people saying, oh, artificial
sweeteners kill microbiome. not true all. fact, study
published nature showed negative affects saccharin
microbiome blocked eliminated giving antibiotics. happens


certain artificial sweeteners particular saccharin disrupt microbiome make
environment within gut mucosal lining favorable bacteria microbiota
not good organism. important distinction. not just language
thing people say, oh, know, kills microbiome. doesn't kill
microbiome. shifts microbiome shifts microbiome can good
can bad. takes us another topic bit hot button topic

01:28:00 Ketogenic, Vegan, & Processed Food Effects, Individual Differences

willing go there. 'Cause think deserves conversation, nowadays
many examples people switched kind standard
diet even vegetarian diet vegan diet, keto diet. Now keto doesn't
necessarily mean ingestion meats, can. experience
positive effects themselves. Not everybody. talked previously
kind incorrect, believe incorrect marketing keto relates
cosmetic effects challenges sleep people
people love keto works great them. ketogenic diet interesting
one shifts ketogenic diet shift gut microbiome.
people end feeling better. people end feeling worse. Likewise,
people go ingesting animal products including meat vegetarian
go vegan experience positive shifts mood affect. know
transition plant-based diet especially enrichment fiber
present diets also creates dramatic shifts gut microbiome. people
feel better that. people feel worse. course, gonna depend
whether not ingesting lot processed foods not. paper
published "Cell", "Cell Press" journal obviously, excellent journal, showing
ingestion processed foods, regardless whether not come animal
sources non-animal sources processed foods tend create activity
within body surely roots nervous system lead over-
consumption calories weight gain. Even weight gain couldn't
explained increased calories. words, processed foods bad, regardless
whether not talking animal products non animal products, probably not
surprising given know sugar sensing amino acid sensing
cells gut talked earlier. point say


find right you, not throwaway statement. people's
microbiome lining mucosa, excuse me, mucosa lining throat,
gut, nose, everything improved diets heavily meat based
don't many plants. people much better plant-based diet without
many meat products animal products. highly individual. probably
roots genetic makeup. probably roots people raised
remember nervous system course set genetic, genes,
genetic program nervous system adapts early life conditions.
for, reason nervous system move body appropriately
towards things good away things not. also

doesn't get ethical issues around animals planet, hear rabid
debates sides. not qualified equipped talk
whether not regenerative agriculture, animal products, farming
things, actually impact environment, not expertise,
comes health microbiome want support microbiome.
clear fermented foods support microbiome ingesting
least two servings per day. quite lot supplementation low levels can
good. Supplementation high levels can create brain fog even though people
say result controversial. experienced data looked


pretty darn solid. one thing think well. thing
gut microbiome highly contextual based things doing.
even things like exercise social well-being connection, things also
impacting gut microbiome. find diet right you. works
context ethical lifestyle choices important you.
advice. note fasting. colleague Yale, expert

01:33:20 Fasting-Based Depletion Microbiome

gut microbiome. told something really interesting,
fast, actually digest certain components within dietary tract. actually depletes
good amount gut microbiome. interesting. good results
guess call intermittent kind circadian type fasting never
done long fast, push first meal hours first meal
generally around lunchtime longer periods fasting go day
two three days known deplete gut microbiome major ways. not
always necessarily bad thing replenished, often replenished
levels exceeded previous level. think GI tract even
mental effects returning eating feeding sometimes people don't
feel good start eating. really want food, start eating
again. don't feel good fast. may related
depletion microbiome occurs long fast. again, something
think talk doctor, idea fasting across board
good. may merits that, certainly cases,
deplete microbiome depletion microbiome significant
means return eating, actually not position digest
assimilate foods. foods not position impact
brain body way prior fast. is, think people
suggest kind gradual transition back consuming nutrients fast.
round up, want share results without question will impact
way respond food mentally even physically. know
central theme studies tell about.

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues
experiment took housekeepers, essentially hotel workers,


divide two groups. watch short film. one case, film
work important help people feel comfortable hotel, et
cetera, et cetera. group heard activity

01:38:30 Mindset Controls Metabolism

cleaning taking care hotel good them. good
health, et cetera, et cetera. controlled nicely study health
parameters, individual differences. behaviors people
period followed short tutorial. found eight weeks later,
group told activity good showed lower blood
pressure. lost significant amount body fat reported enjoying
work far group. work, simply biased mentally
information given, physiology followed information.
not just placebo effect. incredible set findings illustrate
extent whether not believe food gonna good us not good
us. Well, can't escape reality. can't tell poison gonna
good ingest poison expect not kill you, can tell
eating 12 croissants, confess done it, long run, long time
ago can't tell necessarily going good
gonna make lose weight. belief effects not lying
cases, experiments notice subjects didn't prior knowledge
grehlin effects daily routine weight loss blood
pressure. order work naive information, right?
can't simply lie tell want believe
important, also important mind body fascinating
interplay. today talked mainly body things put
inside tube, runs mouth end rectum, basically
impacting cells, neurons, microbiota mucosal lining, heart, lungs
information feeding brain impact feel here.
also feel impacting body reacts levels core
physiology couldn't just tell gonna work,
believe certain substances, certain foods, certain nutrients profound
effect magnitude impact

branches. not just one thing. really liked that. liked naming polyvagal.
idea Porges put forward dorsal vagus, kind
runs back spinal cord, involved alertness activation kind
fight flight type stuff. ventral pathway involved
kind empathic behaviors. not quite agreement modern
anatomy, best time. So, okay. problem
polyvagal theory way discussed people often say, oh
dorsal vagus active tend someone little keyed
people kind state freeze kind flacid kind like just not really
active just lethargic. Well, pathway hypoactive.
active. lot theories psychology maps onto vagus.
far know, don't map real physiology. Now, problem kind
way polyvagal theory discussed probably not real experts,
lot people people start diagnose different psychological physical
manifestations vagus. say things like, Oh person hyper
flexible joints therefore dorsal vagus isn't active enough something like
that. really kind gone way outside lane lines. today gonna clean
lot that. make really simple

00:18:27 Vagus Senses Many Things, & Moves Organs

vagus actually works. least understand today 2021. First
all, mentioned, sensory information way detect light
eyes hear sounds ears, sensors gut sense
full empty gut is. can also sense acidic gut is. can sense
various things within gut. heart same. informing brain
fast heart beating, full lungs communicated
status immune system. way think vagus way
think eyes. eyes looking colors, looking motion
looking bright is. one things, features telling
brain something different. brain can decide awake asleep whether
not looking somebody's attractive unattractive. vagus nerve also
analyzing many features within body informing brain feel
do. really good example think exciting one relates


sugar. know sweet things generally tastes good.

00:19:35 Sugar Sensing Without Perception Sweetness

not particularly fan sweet things. know, much rather cheese
pizza hamburger steak. like savory fatty foods, like sweet foods.
people find sweet foods attractive. want them, might might not
able regulate behavior around them, want them. really
interesting hundreds years people thought
way sweet foods taste. makes sense, right? eat something tastes
sweet. want it. Well, turns much interesting that.
eat something sweet within stomach, cells, neurons,
sense presence sugary foods independent taste signal brain.
sensors, neurons send information vagus brain goes
series stations. release dopamine. molecule makes
want whatever just ingested. fact, pathway
powerful done experiments completely numb taste
feeling somebody's mouth blindfolded. don't know eating
eating food. either sugary not sugary. find
even though people can't taste sugary food crave food contains
sugar sensors gut, sense sugar. put differently,
actually sensors within body make crave sugar independent
sweet taste things. Now incredible. does, tells us
circuits body driving us towards certain behaviors
making us feel good even though can't perceive them. Now,
really interested gut intuition kind gut feelings gut feeling except
chemical gut feeling. particular set neurons detecting something
body particular feature, case presence sugars, sending
information brain essentially control behavior. find remarkable,
means call attractive isn't always coming
thoughts feelings, even perception. drawn particular
foods drawn perhaps also particular people, places things
information coming body. gonna talk
one can information. know many people thoughtful concerned


sugars days thinking ingest much sugar. sugar snuck
things eat. indeed, true. mean, completely reframe way
think sort so-called hidden sugars foods. means
even food savory like piece pizza piece bread even like salad
dressing sugar snuck can't taste will still crave
thing without knowing crave sugar. words,
might find wanting certain foods not knowing want foods.
find fascinating aspect biology yes, relates mood
emotion. talk moment.

00:23:00 Eating-Induced Anxiety

just back bit ask question eat certain things?
certain foods make us feel good? foods actually make us feel anxious.
think people may familiar this. people might not, people
don't realize approach eating anxiety associated that.
alertness. Remember previous discussions, even don't haven't
seen those, moods feelings wellbeing anchored continuum
alertness versus calmness. hear often rest digest. know
that, oh, eat, feel really nice full, hopefully comfortably full not
full. relaxing. feel satiated, associated serotonin molecule
satiation. true. people don't know area
hypothalamus. deepen brain kind middle deep portion brain called
lateral hypothalamus. lateral hypothalamus really interesting
controls feeding, inhibits feeding. stops us feeding. another area
brain. want names, give you. don't want names, just ignore
them, delete memory awareness, called locus coeruleus, now
locus coeruleus sits back brainstem releases norepinephrine
essentially adrenaline. makes us feel alert. Now, locus coeruleus lot
different functions brain, going eat say walk
restaurant, sit preparing meal, locus coeruleus known release
noradrenaline brain. creating kind alertness. ancient utility,
creating alertness. many people, experience approach food
stress anxiety. interesting approach food locus coeruleus


releasing molecules make us feel anxious alert sometimes
felt excitement. asks probably feel food generally,
happy relationship food? trying restrict relationship
food, people coming dinner, will play course,
certain stress anxiety upon approach food. approach food feel
anxiety locus coeruleus activates lateral hypothalamus way inhibits
feeding makes us not want eat. lot people kind pre-meal
anxiety anxiety around food can't seem just calm good
meal access later rest digest. lot heightened
stress upon approach food lot tools there, eating
disorders just kind general public isn't suffering eating disorders,
things like mindfulness around meals. know, always tell never
eat stressed. sorry, life not organized way can that.
never eat. Right eat awake don't know stressed,
don't think tend run around lot day. don't generally take
time two three deep breaths eat. generally will just eat. can
healthy unhealthy depending quality digestion. think using digestion
guide good, lot people aren't aware interaction locus
coeruleus lateral hypothalamus basic mechanism supposed
get little bit alert anxious around mealtime. eat, mechanisms
calming satiation supposed kick mechanisms involve
mentioned earlier, two things. One things taste, digestion starts mouth.
course, taste food. Everyone tells us chew food more. Yes,
can improve digestion. not supposed drink many fluids eat.
true too, lot feel eat eat vagus
sensing gut. sending information time. sugar?
fats? contaminants? lot information. so-called
parallel pathways going brain regulate whether not want
eat something not. accelerators, things make us want
eat more, like sugar fats nutrient dense. helps
generally, least short term

00:27:30 Eat Brain Perceives “Amino Acid Threshold”



support survival animals, also amino acids. important.
lot data, much comes data people eat
much eat subconscious detection many amino acids
array, meaning constellation amino acids given food. fair say
sum total studies pointing direction people will basically eat, not
stomach full brain perceives adequate intake
amino acids. Now, conversation comes context know,
meat, keto, kind zone diet, Mediterranean diet, vegan diet.
largely going ignore kind strict camps today. will talk little bit it,
think one actually taps something important brain
body relationship ones don't. don't want get discussion
ethics different foods animal based non animal based. 'Cause not
topic today. really nutrient sensing amino acid sensing. generally
will eat gut tells brain adequate amounts amino acids.
Amino acids course important building blocks sure,
muscle, things body need repair. people don't
realize amino acids neurochemicals brain made from.
Now, vitally important. Okay, heard dopamine molecule
makes feel good. Actually dopamine molecule makes feel good.
released within brain. feel good dopamine release,
dopamine releases caused surprise, excitement, events looking forward
turnout well, inhibited events looking forward don't work
someone says going call really really excited talk to,
don't, thought movie gonna really great not,
expect meal really delicious. kind of, eh, actually

00:29:45 Reward Prediction Error: Buildup, Letdown Wanting

name that. called reward prediction error. can actually use
context meals plans way useful people
know, essentially expect something really terrific really place higher
expectation chemical level. don't get much dopamine
expecting something, hear really great restaurant place
really, case, have, wouldn't call addiction. call


affliction croissants. best vegetable course, croissant. get really
excited fact someone will tell me, oh place
incredible croissants. gotta go there. get really excited, go. just
telling gonna really terrific raises expectation, dopamine
expectation. unless croissants amazing chances going
experience less good, less satisfying. will truly release less dopamine
just said, oh yeah, think croissants street.
just tried one random, reward prediction error
expectation something releases dopamine actual event releases dopamine.
event related dopamine not exceed expectation least match it,
much higher tendency won't pursue thing again. dopamine
really powerful not just molecule reward. molecule desire.
molecule wanting not just molecule having. book, since people often
ask book recommendations. don't know author personally, love book.
called "The Molecule More". terrific book. wish written it, frankly,
want learn dopamine reward prediction error dopamine
regulates various aspects emotional motivational life, terrific read.
Dopamine going lead us want eat something not want
something, dopamine really craving. motivation
desire. mentioned, amino acid sensors gut detecting
many amino acids

00:32:01 L-Tyrosine, Dopamine, Motivation, Mood, & Movement

also detecting amino acids. particular amino acid called
L-tyrosine comes food. can look online, foods contain L-
tyrosine. meats. nuts. also plant-based foods. L-tyrosine
precursor couple molecules like L-DOPA, et cetera, make dopamine.
misconception serotonin gut.
dopamine gut. therefore mood gut. not quite way
works. Okay. talk serotonin moment dopamine synthesized
amino acids eat. However, dopamine neurons give rise
feelings good wanting desire motivation, reside brain.
don't want get confused. want respect honor power gut


vagal pathway, really neurons within brain drive pursuit

people make little dopamine need prescription dopamine. need

challenges mood. Now, hopefully don't Parkinson's,
clear dietary L-tyrosine supports healthy production things like
dopamine well factors within brain. Now, people immediately
ask, well supplement L-tyrosine? just talk
gonna come up. Full disclosure, sometimes take L-tyrosine. not taking right now,
take occasionally, can buy capsule form. increase kind
mood elevation alertness. counter. check
doctor. not responsible healthcare not doctor, whether not
safe you, people preexisting hyper dopaminergic conditions like mania
probably not take L-tyrosine. thing taking L-tyrosine crash,
okay? not massive crash take appropriate doses right
can produce crash lethargy kind brain fog next day so.
L-tyrosine however can ingested foods supplementation
increase dopamine levels. well-known, taken chronically however, can disrupt
dopamine pathways. Now drugs will increase L-tyrosine
dopamine well. severe enough generally tend
addictive properties. things like methamphetamine, things like cocaine terrible


really ramp dopamine system much people really can't
achieve dopamine release mechanisms. food ingestion
L-tyrosine profound effect levels dopamine. takes little
really will impact level mood. Certain antidepressants fall category
dopaminergic antidepressants. One famous ones course Wellbutrin.
Wellbutrin developed lot antidepressants tend make
people feel kind lethargic side effect profiles people didn't like.
developed thing that, generic name different, generally called
Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin activates dopamine epinephrin, substrate
dopamine. involved motivation alertness effort.
might say, wow, sounds like great drug. However, drug, side effect profile
tends things associated elevated mood alertness. isn't
like taking L-tyrosine. isn't like eating tyrosine rich foods. really
much greater release dopamine epinephrin, increases things like anxiety,
sweating, pupils dilate. certain effects on, particular people epilepsy,

like serotonin dopamine. commercial products there. me,
just me, not particularly impressed. know, not getting

can done rigorously. tests there. even some, believe
not. questionnaires that, think actually last year made
bigger newspapers, dopamine serotonin? that?
find stuff little silly although appreciate, like fact people
thinking talking neuromodulators aren't really great ways
measure things outside clinic. great clinical tools can
get inside hospital proper endocrinologist neurologist, no great at-

decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact

sugar. know sweet things generally tastes good.

00:19:35 Sugar Sensing Without Perception Sweetness

not particularly fan sweet things. know, much rather cheese
pizza hamburger steak. like savory fatty foods, like sweet foods.
people find sweet foods attractive. want them, might might not
able regulate behavior around them, want them. really
interesting hundreds years people thought
way sweet foods taste. makes sense, right? eat something tastes
sweet. want it. Well, turns much interesting that.
eat something sweet within stomach, cells, neurons,
sense presence sugary foods independent taste signal brain.
sensors, neurons send information vagus brain goes
series stations. release dopamine. molecule makes
want whatever just ingested. fact, pathway
powerful done experiments completely numb taste
feeling somebody's mouth blindfolded. don't know eating
eating food. either sugary not sugary. find
even though people can't taste sugary food crave food contains
sugar sensors gut, sense sugar. put differently,
actually sensors within body make crave sugar independent
sweet taste things. Now incredible. does, tells us
circuits body driving us towards certain behaviors
making us feel good even though can't perceive them. Now,
really interested gut intuition kind gut feelings gut feeling except
chemical gut feeling. particular set neurons detecting something
body particular feature, case presence sugars, sending
information brain essentially control behavior. find remarkable,
means call attractive isn't always coming
thoughts feelings, even perception. drawn particular
foods drawn perhaps also particular people, places things
information coming body. gonna talk
one can information. know many people thoughtful concerned


sugars days thinking ingest much sugar. sugar snuck
things eat. indeed, true. mean, completely reframe way
think sort so-called hidden sugars foods. means
even food savory like piece pizza piece bread even like salad
dressing sugar snuck can't taste will still crave
thing without knowing crave sugar. words,
might find wanting certain foods not knowing want foods.
find fascinating aspect biology yes, relates mood
emotion. talk moment.

00:23:00 Eating-Induced Anxiety

just back bit ask question eat certain things?
certain foods make us feel good? foods actually make us feel anxious.
think people may familiar this. people might not, people
don't realize approach eating anxiety associated that.
alertness. Remember previous discussions, even don't haven't
seen those, moods feelings wellbeing anchored continuum
alertness versus calmness. hear often rest digest. know
that, oh, eat, feel really nice full, hopefully comfortably full not
full. relaxing. feel satiated, associated serotonin molecule
satiation. true. people don't know area
hypothalamus. deepen brain kind middle deep portion brain called
lateral hypothalamus. lateral hypothalamus really interesting
controls feeding, inhibits feeding. stops us feeding. another area
brain. want names, give you. don't want names, just ignore
them, delete memory awareness, called locus coeruleus, now
locus coeruleus sits back brainstem releases norepinephrine
essentially adrenaline. makes us feel alert. Now, locus coeruleus lot
different functions brain, going eat say walk
restaurant, sit preparing meal, locus coeruleus known release
noradrenaline brain. creating kind alertness. ancient utility,
creating alertness. many people, experience approach food
stress anxiety. interesting approach food locus coeruleus


releasing molecules make us feel anxious alert sometimes
felt excitement. asks probably feel food generally,
happy relationship food? trying restrict relationship
food, people coming dinner, will play course,
certain stress anxiety upon approach food. approach food feel
anxiety locus coeruleus activates lateral hypothalamus way inhibits
feeding makes us not want eat. lot people kind pre-meal
anxiety anxiety around food can't seem just calm good
meal access later rest digest. lot heightened
stress upon approach food lot tools there, eating
disorders just kind general public isn't suffering eating disorders,
things like mindfulness around meals. know, always tell never
eat stressed. sorry, life not organized way can that.
never eat. Right eat awake don't know stressed,
don't think tend run around lot day. don't generally take
time two three deep breaths eat. generally will just eat. can
healthy unhealthy depending quality digestion. think using digestion
guide good, lot people aren't aware interaction locus
coeruleus lateral hypothalamus basic mechanism supposed
get little bit alert anxious around mealtime. eat, mechanisms
calming satiation supposed kick mechanisms involve
mentioned earlier, two things. One things taste, digestion starts mouth.
course, taste food. Everyone tells us chew food more. Yes,
can improve digestion. not supposed drink many fluids eat.
true too, lot feel eat eat vagus
sensing gut. sending information time. sugar?
fats? contaminants? lot information. so-called
parallel pathways going brain regulate whether not want
eat something not. accelerators, things make us want
eat more, like sugar fats nutrient dense. helps
generally, least short term

00:27:30 Eat Brain Perceives “Amino Acid Threshold”



support survival animals, also amino acids. important.
lot data, much comes data people eat
much eat subconscious detection many amino acids
array, meaning constellation amino acids given food. fair say
sum total studies pointing direction people will basically eat, not
stomach full brain perceives adequate intake
amino acids. Now, conversation comes context know,
meat, keto, kind zone diet, Mediterranean diet, vegan diet.
largely going ignore kind strict camps today. will talk little bit it,
think one actually taps something important brain
body relationship ones don't. don't want get discussion
ethics different foods animal based non animal based. 'Cause not
topic today. really nutrient sensing amino acid sensing. generally
will eat gut tells brain adequate amounts amino acids.
Amino acids course important building blocks sure,
muscle, things body need repair. people don't
realize amino acids neurochemicals brain made from.
Now, vitally important. Okay, heard dopamine molecule
makes feel good. Actually dopamine molecule makes feel good.
released within brain. feel good dopamine release,
dopamine releases caused surprise, excitement, events looking forward
turnout well, inhibited events looking forward don't work
someone says going call really really excited talk to,
don't, thought movie gonna really great not,
expect meal really delicious. kind of, eh, actually

00:29:45 Reward Prediction Error: Buildup, Letdown Wanting

name that. called reward prediction error. can actually use
context meals plans way useful people
know, essentially expect something really terrific really place higher
expectation chemical level. don't get much dopamine
expecting something, hear really great restaurant place
really, case, have, wouldn't call addiction. call


affliction croissants. best vegetable course, croissant. get really
excited fact someone will tell me, oh place
incredible croissants. gotta go there. get really excited, go. just
telling gonna really terrific raises expectation, dopamine
expectation. unless croissants amazing chances going
experience less good, less satisfying. will truly release less dopamine
just said, oh yeah, think croissants street.
just tried one random, reward prediction error
expectation something releases dopamine actual event releases dopamine.
event related dopamine not exceed expectation least match it,
much higher tendency won't pursue thing again. dopamine
really powerful not just molecule reward. molecule desire.
molecule wanting not just molecule having. book, since people often
ask book recommendations. don't know author personally, love book.
called "The Molecule More". terrific book. wish written it, frankly,
want learn dopamine reward prediction error dopamine
regulates various aspects emotional motivational life, terrific read.
Dopamine going lead us want eat something not want
something, dopamine really craving. motivation
desire. mentioned, amino acid sensors gut detecting
many amino acids

00:32:01 L-Tyrosine, Dopamine, Motivation, Mood, & Movement

also detecting amino acids. particular amino acid called
L-tyrosine comes food. can look online, foods contain L-
tyrosine. meats. nuts. also plant-based foods. L-tyrosine
precursor couple molecules like L-DOPA, et cetera, make dopamine.
misconception serotonin gut.
dopamine gut. therefore mood gut. not quite way
works. Okay. talk serotonin moment dopamine synthesized
amino acids eat. However, dopamine neurons give rise
feelings good wanting desire motivation, reside brain.
don't want get confused. want respect honor power gut


vagal pathway, really neurons within brain drive pursuit
decision-making, mean? Well, people make little dopamine.
people make little dopamine need prescription dopamine. need
L-DOPA, people Parkinson's take L-DOPA compounds increase
dopamine Parkinson's associated deficits movement, starts
tremor, actually starts things interesting. talk
moment, Parkinson's depression. blunting motivation mood
effect, tremor. eventually severe conditions challenges
speaking walking famous examples Muhammad Ali, Michael
J. Fox, great boxing trainer, Freddie Roach, like people Parkinson's
least later life challenges speaking. Now not just fighters
develop Parkinson's far know, Michael J. Fox wasn't fighter. People can
develop Parkinson's Parkinson's depletion dopamine neurons brain.
not just movement challenges.

00:34:04 Supplementing L-Tyrosine, Drugs Abuse, Wellbutrin

challenges mood. Now, hopefully don't Parkinson's,
clear dietary L-tyrosine supports healthy production things like
dopamine well factors within brain. Now, people immediately
ask, well supplement L-tyrosine? just talk
gonna come up. Full disclosure, sometimes take L-tyrosine. not taking right now,
take occasionally, can buy capsule form. increase kind
mood elevation alertness. counter. check
doctor. not responsible healthcare not doctor, whether not
safe you, people preexisting hyper dopaminergic conditions like mania
probably not take L-tyrosine. thing taking L-tyrosine crash,
okay? not massive crash take appropriate doses right
can produce crash lethargy kind brain fog next day so.
L-tyrosine however can ingested foods supplementation
increase dopamine levels. well-known, taken chronically however, can disrupt
dopamine pathways. Now drugs will increase L-tyrosine
dopamine well. severe enough generally tend
addictive properties. things like methamphetamine, things like cocaine terrible


really ramp dopamine system much people really can't
achieve dopamine release mechanisms. food ingestion
L-tyrosine profound effect levels dopamine. takes little
really will impact level mood. Certain antidepressants fall category
dopaminergic antidepressants. One famous ones course Wellbutrin.
Wellbutrin developed lot antidepressants tend make
people feel kind lethargic side effect profiles people didn't like.
developed thing that, generic name different, generally called
Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin activates dopamine epinephrin, substrate
dopamine. involved motivation alertness effort.
might say, wow, sounds like great drug. However, drug, side effect profile
tends things associated elevated mood alertness. isn't
like taking L-tyrosine. isn't like eating tyrosine rich foods. really
much greater release dopamine epinephrin, increases things like anxiety,
sweating, pupils dilate. certain effects on, particular people epilepsy,
used somewhat successfully smoking cessation, again, not
everybody not encourage use things. just describing
biology rationale drugs developed. back
second. just kind take stock at. brain body connection.
many them, one main ones vagus nerve. vagus
collects information lot things, breathing, heart rate stuff happening
gut, et cetera, gut way, includes stomach intestines, sends
information brain. brain using information decide one two
things, move toward something move away. can also pause, essentially pausing
not moving toward. dopamine pathway foods rich L-tyrosine
generally give us elevated mood make us want whatever
happen well things, motivation, generalizes things
not unique just ingesting foods foods give us big pulse dopamine will
make us crave food. will make us crave activity led
ingestion food. mentioned earlier, lot happening
subconscious level not even aware of. think concern
hidden sugars ingestion sugars serious not just
sugars impacting blood glucose negative ways. Although often is, not just
obesity crisis happening. also fact disrupting dopamine

00:38:29 Serotonin: Gut, Brain, Satiety Prozac

neurochemicals subconsciously. like talk
pathways brain body regulate moods emotions also
actionable. neuromodulator really interesting context
vagus serotonin. Serotonin, just remind neuromodulator therefore creates
bias neural circuits neurons brain body going active
makes less likely ones going active. think fair say
without ever measured bulldog Costello, just brain body must
swimming serotonin, calm eats lot generally
feels pretty sated. kind animal obsessed comforts. bit
hedonist, serotonin elevated tends make us feel really comfortable

mainly put us pursuit things. Motivation pursuit. Serotonin
feeling really comfy are. conversation around brain body relationship
mood serotonin many years was, well, eat big meal. gut
distended. got nutrients need rest digest serotonin

interesting actionable going on. First all, you, perhaps not
heard 90% serotonin make gut. indeed
lot serotonin gut. neurons gut makes serotonin.
neurons brain make serotonin, deal.
serotonin impacts mood mental state not gut.
neurons brain area called raphae nucleus brain,
locations too, neurons control whether not feel
satiated not. Whether not feel happy calm. can't discussion
serotonin without discussion antidepressants.
late eighties early nineties explosion number prescription
drugs released. Things like first one famous one Prozac, Zoloft
Paxil, number ones so-called SSRI selective serotonin re-uptake


inhibitors. long acronym, basically drugs work preventing
gobbling serotonin re-uptake serotonin neurons released

can reduce appetite food. can reduce appetite sex. can sorts things,
can work really well. Sometimes dose-related issue, et cetera. Serotonin
fascinating however, well neurons raphe work impacted
events within gut. Although might surprised find
events are. go little bit deeper gut. again, gut includes
stomach small intestine large intestine ask like, going
serotonin gut? impacting serotonin brain? think
context us might want increase decrease serotonin
levels. far know, aren't really good home blood tests things
like serotonin dopamine. commercial products there. me,
just me, not particularly impressed. know, not getting
hormones levels measured metabolic factors measured, can daunting.
can done rigorously. tests there. even some, believe
not. questionnaires that, think actually last year made
bigger newspapers, dopamine serotonin? that?
find stuff little silly although appreciate, like fact people
thinking talking neuromodulators aren't really great ways
measure things outside clinic. great clinical tools can
get inside hospital proper endocrinologist neurologist, no great at-
home tool. maybe call arms entrepreneurial folks
create tests, accurate tests please, done home.
people feel like anxious always motivated state
trying adjust serotonin. Many people adjust serotonin just eating
food

00:43:38 Eating Promote Dopamine (Daytime) & Serotonin (Night Time)



carbohydrate rich foods will increase serotonin. talked previous
podcast personally big fan least usually fast exercise
early part day eat relatively high protein moderate fat zero carb low carb
meal lunch afternoon stay alert foods tend favor dopamine
production acetylcholine production, epinephrin production alertness. mood
generally pretty good time. evening comes around
concerned sleep good night's sleep, not concerned anxious way,
want get good night's sleep. will ingest foods promote serotonin release
contain lot tryptophan. eat meat, like white
meat, turkey meat. don't tend to, never liked turkey. don't mind animal

00:44:30 Supplementing Serotonin: Sleep, & Caution Sleep Disruptions

don't like ingesting meat, starchy carbohydrates will increase serotonin.
people also will take serotonin. can now buy 5-HTP supplements.
little bit tricky. 5-HTP supplements can course increase 5-HTP. 5-HTP
serotonin sometimes can create problems endogenous self-made
production serotonin. never fan taking things close chemical
trying increase long periods time. Maybe occasional use.
problem take serotonin supplements, 5-HTP, fall asleep. sleep
intense wake three four hours later. know based sleep

00:51:00 Emotional Context Book Recommendation: “How Emotions Made”

going relates emotions. last episode said
something gonna repeat now briefly, much talk


good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman
Podcast. discussions Instagram Live, Northeastern
University, world expert emotions. first book "How Emotions Made"
not book sent me. paid money years ago, bought it, read
it, loved long met Lisa, just delighted got known
little bit. really interesting read psychology emotions
subjectivity emotions. So, whereas talking mainly biology emotions
gets little bit psychology biology well. Lisa's just
terrific. also putting lot information world emotion.
want learn check work, again, Lisa Feldman Barrett.
book "How Emotions Made" Hopefully continue write many
books. now understand relationship hope foods dopamine,
foods serotonin communicated brain via
vagus, right? ingest foods, supplements things people take,
don't put directly brain. put gut. yes, gut
brain connection not serotonin gut makes feel calm
placid. not dopamine gut. just oversold way
think something really attractive. understand idea
certain things experience life emotions happening body.
maybe little control, right? thing hard container.
can't just stuff dopamine there. probably take Mucuna pruriens
bean stuff ear, please don't that. It'd make ear itchy
serotonin outside. can't get stuff there. ingest
things metabolized certain ways communicate brain maybe
pass brain across called blood brain barrier. talk
blood brain barrier minute. actually called BBB. ends


sounding like baby, BBB. guess like BB, anyway, BBB, also nerves

feel better want more. Oh, got lot bitterness acid taste it.
want less that. transitioned discussion dopamine
serotonin gut hopefully got actionable items belt,
pun intended, can understand certain foods certain nutrients
can look up, might impact mood. somebody really anxious
really wired. Well, dopamine adrenaline pathway epinephrine pathway
probably not one want lean harder. tend someone
pretty passive trouble motivation. Well think ramping
dopamine pathway through, always think behaviors proper food choices
best way start. behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.

00:56:45 Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil Alleviating Depression

talk little bit things ingest body allow
body inform brain shift mood. something
years. just want say found complete game changer.
excellent science support it. think people familiar different
context don't think people know simple fact omega-3
omega-6 fatty acid ratio profound effect depression. profound effect
mood much double-blind placebo controlled study will provide
link too, study first published 2008 there've many others well.
First all, experiment done animals. found model learned
helplessness animals. not kind animals, put rats mice
jar. let swim swim, swim, swim try save life.
eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially
done humans although didn't swim point near drowning.
took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,
appetite, sorts negative health effects. comparison thousand
milligrams day EPA. EPA one elements contains high levels
omega-3's things like fish oil, talk sources little bit
wasn't thousand milligrams fish oil. thousand milligrams EPA. Compared
20 milligrams Fluoxetine Prozac, okay. Really increases serotonin.
study 60 individuals, again, provide links study. found
equally effective reducing depressive symptoms. imagine that,
food-based compound can't make without, right, not situation
can make omega-3s. get food sources
supplementation, effective 20 milligrams fluoxetine course eight


weeks. really interesting addition combination
thousand milligrams EPA Fluoxetine synergistic effect lowering
depressive symptoms. find remarkable. heard first came
wasn't sure make it. 'Cause lot studies come
generally like focus changes behavior around things large
center mass. lot information. couple years later, fact start taking
thousand milligrams per day EPA fish oil. Now side effects fish
oil. People blood, bleeders Factor V Leiden mutations
women taking birth control, can affect blood clotting things
sort really talk doctor make sure okay you. Fish oil also can give
people fishy breath pretty gross, frankly, now fish oils either
Encapsulations put lemon flavoring
doesn't effect. event, thousand milligrams per day EPA. started
ingesting regularly. just felt better. wasn't clinically depressed, generally,
feel least me, increase mood affect. number things
supposed reduce inflammation. cardiovascular effects controversial long
time everyone thought effects platelets really terrific.
articles came major newspapers saying maybe not much effects
mood really profound. now lots studies.

01:01:00 Fish Oil Antidepressant

go PubMed put EPA fish oil depression find
number really impressive results showing least
effective certain SSRI antidepressants dosages can amplify improve
effect low dosages SSRIs. feel like people
know this. nutrition, profoundly affecting mood depression
terrible, right? Depression can component anxiety cases
people feel lousy uncertain. kind talk depression
anxiety talk someone anxious can tell everything's
gonna okay. always concerned might not know.
don't really know plane isn't gonna crash. don't really know life gonna go
okay. sense, right, no one crystal ball can predict
future, tend perseverate fixate uncertainty. course


versions depression involve certainty. People lethargic
certain say, yeah, certain, never gonna get another job. certain,
never gonna meet anyone new. certain gonna fail. kind divide
sphere depression around certainty uncertainty. interesting
thousand milligrams per day EPA shown relieve forms
depression. Now, mean gonna work everybody? No, not
try play psychiatrist. want point direction manuscripts
can make informed choices yourself. can discuss doctor
family make choices right you. especially
interesting heart effects, heard omega-3s,

01:02:40 EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain

course can get sources too, can get fatty fish,
flax seeds, hemp seeds. number chia seeds, kinds things
levels EPA required quite high. thousand milligrams per day
pretty hard get food although can done depending
eating. interesting heart effects solid really stand
literature lot something talked previous episode.
mention again, heart rate variability. know heart rate
really high heart rate, really low. Neither good. lot people
think, oh just want low heart rate, big stroke volume. know, running
lot may 30 40 beats per minute. great shape still want
heart rate variability. lot tone autonomic nervous system
talked last time. How, inhale, speeds heart rate. exhale,
decreases heart rate. called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. basis
heart rate variability. maybe short post this. can get
mechanism behaviors spill might useful you.
point heart rate variability. HRV good. interesting
study 2009 showed people eat diet fail supplement
way high omega-6 three ratio, not enough omega-3s, not
markers inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 TNF-alpha,
tend non-responders antidepressants. Shifting omega-3 omega-6 ratio
couple things. First all, increasing amount EPA shifted ratio.


higher omega-3 omega-6 ratio, good, lowered inflammation markers,
allowed antidepressants effect, even low doses.
really interesting thing. worked increasing heart rate variability, think, well,
world happen? know mean, ton effects
way works way things impacting gut
autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, said, vagus includes connections
heart signaling sensory information fast heart beating
brain not just stuff lungs, information heart brain
adjusts heart rate heart rate variability. incredible way one
can use gut, ingestion EPA's, either food
supplementation increase rate variability thereby improve symptoms, meaning
reduce symptoms depression, even make low levels antidepressants
wouldn't otherwise work work. think like study much a, super
cool. bridges brain body access. incorporates nutrition micronutrients
brain also really points something hear time,
body whole system. working whole system brain isn't working
isolation skull. reacting things happening body
gut heart rate heart rate variability. things ingest can
profound effect them. Now, course, really want emphasize something
no one compound nutrient supplement drug behavior
matter going end shifting depression improving one's
mood improving sleep. constellation things. especially true
people start get excited supplements drugs kinds potential
various things. Right now, lot excitement psychedelics
therapeutic uses. think great, good friend mine physician
clinician says better living chemistry still requires better living. cannot
expect take compound regardless source potency completely shift
experience life without continue engage proper behaviors,
things know proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.
many others well. still find collection studies omega-3
omega-6 ratios profoundly important much completely changed
way think food, foods eat, supplement. don't necessarily think
everybody really think incredible compounds
robust effects feelings wellbeing.



01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either
food supplementation. acknowledge not everyone wants take fish oil.
couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment
makes not want ingest fish related products. krill oil. Krill still
organism. little tiny thing whales eat lot people generally eat little
of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.
preference. people really like krill oil source omega-3s. mention
sources like chia seeds flax seeds, notice
not things tend ingest lot regular basis. possible get omega-3s
meats. animals grazed grasses contain lot omega-3s.
ingest meat source meat gonna important
relates omega-3s. Even within category fish oil concern
sometimes mercury contaminants. want go brand
emphasizes gone really good sources decontaminate
regardless. search brands. test can


01:09:05 L-Carnitine Mood, Sperm Ovary Quality, Autism, Fibromyalgia,
Migraine

whether not fish oil rancid not. people take liquid form.
people take capsule form. liquid form gonna affordable. capsule
form little easier little portable. can actually just chew one
gel tablets. tastes really fishy kind rancid, know disgusting.
want spit out. doesn't tolerable know okay.
Unfortunately buy first order that. Although, don't know, maybe
can get open bottle store tell want try


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall
around brain barrier brain important.
feature neurons don't recreate injury, like
organs body. not lot turnover cells despite might've
heard. nature created BBB, blood brain barrier make sure
certain molecules particular, large molecules don't get across blood-brain barrier.
'Cause can damaging tissues. Incidentally, also rigid
stringent barrier around organs, gonads. ovaries
testes brain organs body nature gone way
protect, give additional layer blood-brain barrier might imagine
testes ovaries, going blood gonadal barrier. barriers
exist make just eat something, just ingest
doesn't mean going cross blood-brain barrier, L-carnitine taken
acetylated converted form gets across blood-brain barrier.
lot effects, involved mitochondrial activation long chain fatty acids
big mouthful, get time talking metabolic,
interesting effects neuro side. decide check
examine.com see really interesting things, lots effects ammonia, C-


reactive proteins, things sort, blood glucose lowered, et cetera. stuff
level blood periphery, slight effects lowering cholesterol.
interesting ones. Rates pregnancy go way people taking L-carnitine
father mother source sperm source egg affected
ways favors pregnancy. increase, go sperm quality
sperm motility males seems positive effects females
polycystic ovary syndrome. check out. know, effects strong.
three studies listed there. Again, not promoting this, people
take L-carnitine, especially trying get pregnant check
effects studies mentioned published peer reviewed rigorous
journals. terms neural effects. quite interesting. effects
depression still emerging seem exist people feel notable
decrease depressive symptoms. seven studies listed examine.com
notable benefit variety circumstances participants heightened
depression already. start taking L-carnitine start feeling better.
talk dosages various studies. also shown notable
decrease symptoms autism, find fascinating. Also again, things
ingest impact chemicals brain impact rest body.
things used treat certain forms alcohol dependence.
think going exciting emerging area. gonna whole month
addiction. got great guest lined month, now
emerging field people can take supplement help ease cravings
withdrawal trying quit drugs abuse, like cocaine, alcohol, heroin,
smoking things sort. really interesting area. is, like think
early days gonna discover lot more. huge list things here. Since
talked pain previous episode know lot people written
fibromyalgia. L carnitine shown reduce symptoms
fibromyalgia. Again, links studies examine.com, totally free site.
bulldog battering ram. nothing graceful bulldog.
decided wanted leave go get drink water. please forgive noise.
Okay. now turn another aspect gut-brain relationship will surprise
you, cases might shock you. really cool actionable
biology. gut microbiome, probiotics prebiotics. know today
talking emotions not pain remiss didn't mention another effect


acetylcarnitine reported can find listed link study
examine.com effect reducing symptoms migraine.
randomized controlled trial 133 participants frequent migraines.
taking 500 milligrams L-carnitine nothing 12 weeks. control little bit,

carry risks certain people, not others. again, find right


01:16:29 Gut-Microbiome: Myths, Truths & Tubes Within Us

think super interesting potential therapeutics various people.
deal gut microbiome gut brain axis. Today actually
talking lot already gut brain axis nothing
microbiomes. talking vagus nerve connects providing
sensory information body brain. brain also sends
nerve motor information control motility got heart rate fast
breathe deployment immune stuff killer cells things sort.
oftentimes hear gut brain axis days, discussion
gut microbiome. again, situation incredible biology,
happy much discussion gut microbiome. somewhat
dismayed concerned hear either false partially

just talk general rules thumb related research quality research
peer reviewed. future episode

01:21:55 Probiotics, Brain Fog, Autism, Fermentation

will go far deeper gut microbiome gut brain axis. things
think might find surprising. First all, supporting healthy gut microbiome
good mood, great digestion great immune system function. However,
not mean maxing taking probiotic prebiotic can
possibly manage. mentioned many times believe probiotics, take
probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case
better. things like brain fog can come that, brain fog just
inability focus. People feel really not well generally. studies
little bit controversial think fair say people really increase amount
probiotic taking beyond certain amount start feeling foggy
mind. Now much? Well get probiotics mentioned Athletic
Greens, can get fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,
different sources around world. Actually, love hear
sources people know foods around world. fascinated
way different cultures arrived foods provide support
healthy microbiomes fermented. colleague Stanford, Justin
Sonnenberg, talked this. don't want quote
inappropriately, discussions it, published
ingestion fermented foods one best ways support healthy levels gut
microbiota without exceeding threshold cause things like brain fog.
foods fermented foods going best source. number
different ways one that. people don't like fermented foods, however
people supplement it. isn't case better. know that.
true healthy gut microbiota shown improve symptoms
certain psychiatric illnesses well certain conditions like particular features along

improvement immune system function, conditions neurons
sense nutrients convey information brain increase levels serotonin


dopamine. gut microbiome provides kind foundation healthy gut
healthy gut brain access much people report start eating
small bits 'cause doesn't require lot fermented foods, overall mood
better, not unlike effects EPA. Although don't think looked directly
context clinical depression yet. someone knows study please mention
comments. terrific. things can really
damage gut microbiome. huge misconception want
clear up. study published "Nature", among three
top journals science. know, "Nature", "Science"

01:25:20 Artificial Sweeteners & Gut Microbiome: NOT Bad; Depends!

"Cell" considered top tops, excellent journal showed artificial
sweeteners particular artificial sweetener saccharin can disrupt gut
microbiome ways detrimental number different health markers,
increasing inflammatory cytokines bad things happen gut
microbiome thrown off kilter. study widely discussed
things not mentioned really important. study
saccharin particular. Saccharin not typical artificial sweetener used,
typical artificial sweeteners used things like aspartame, so-called
NutraSweet Sucralose, days Stevia, monk fruits, knowledge
please correct anyone knows studies, knowledge, negative
effects artificial sweeteners gut microbiome restricted saccharin.
Now enough chemical similarity saccharin ones
mentioned, not them. instance, Stevia, monk fruit distinct
chemical makeup probably don't any, lower effects,
negative effects gut microbiome, still tested. saccharin
really, shown study several studies can really negatively impact
quality gut microbiome. Interestingly, narrative around artificial sweeteners
gut microbiome incorrect. people thought, oh, saccharin bad
microbiome. must kill microbiome. hear people saying, oh, artificial

can bad. takes us another topic bit hot button topic

01:28:00 Ketogenic, Vegan, & Processed Food Effects, Individual Differences

willing go there. 'Cause think deserves conversation, nowadays
many examples people switched kind standard
diet even vegetarian diet vegan diet, keto diet. Now keto doesn't
necessarily mean ingestion meats, can. experience
positive effects themselves. Not everybody. talked previously
kind incorrect, believe incorrect marketing keto relates
cosmetic effects challenges sleep people
people love keto works great them. ketogenic diet interesting
one shifts ketogenic diet shift gut microbiome.
people end feeling better. people end feeling worse. Likewise,
people go ingesting animal products including meat vegetarian
go vegan experience positive shifts mood affect. know
transition plant-based diet especially enrichment fiber
present diets also creates dramatic shifts gut microbiome. people
feel better that. people feel worse. course, gonna depend
whether not ingesting lot processed foods not. paper
published "Cell", "Cell Press" journal obviously, excellent journal, showing

sources non-animal sources processed foods tend create activity
within body surely roots nervous system lead over-
consumption calories weight gain. Even weight gain couldn't
explained increased calories. words, processed foods bad, regardless

advice. note fasting. colleague Yale, expert

01:33:20 Fasting-Based Depletion Microbiome

gut microbiome. told something really interesting,
fast, actually digest certain components within dietary tract. actually depletes
good amount gut microbiome. interesting. good results
guess call intermittent kind circadian type fasting never
done long fast, push first meal hours first meal
generally around lunchtime longer periods fasting go day
two three days known deplete gut microbiome major ways. not
always necessarily bad thing replenished, often replenished

mental effects returning eating feeding sometimes people don't
feel good start eating. really want food, start eating
again. don't feel good fast. may related
depletion microbiome occurs long fast. again, something
think talk doctor, idea fasting across board
good. may merits that, certainly cases,
deplete microbiome depletion microbiome significant
means return eating, actually not position digest
assimilate foods. foods not position impact
brain body way prior fast. is, think people
suggest kind gradual transition back consuming nutrients fast.
round up, want share results without question will impact

central theme studies tell about.

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues
experiment took housekeepers, essentially hotel workers,


divide two groups. watch short film. one case, film
work important help people feel comfortable hotel, et

group told activity good showed lower blood
pressure. lost significant amount body fat reported enjoying
work far group. work, simply biased mentally
information given, physiology followed information.
not just placebo effect. incredible set findings illustrate
extent whether not believe food gonna good us not good
us. Well, can't escape reality. can't tell poison gonna
good ingest poison expect not kill you, can tell
eating 12 croissants, confess done it, long run, long time
ago can't tell necessarily going good
gonna make lose weight. belief effects not lying
cases, experiments notice subjects didn't prior knowledge
grehlin effects daily routine weight loss blood
pressure. order work naive information, right?
can't simply lie tell want believe
important, also important mind body fascinating
interplay. today talked mainly body things put

impacting cells, neurons, microbiota mucosal lining, heart, lungs
information feeding brain impact feel here.
also feel impacting body reacts levels core
physiology couldn't just tell gonna work,
believe certain substances, certain foods, certain nutrients profound

sugars days thinking ingest much sugar. sugar snuck
things eat. indeed, true. mean, completely reframe way
think sort so-called hidden sugars foods. means
even food savory like piece pizza piece bread even like salad
dressing sugar snuck can't taste will still crave
thing without knowing crave sugar. words,
might find wanting certain foods not knowing want foods.
find fascinating aspect biology yes, relates mood
emotion. talk moment.

00:23:00 Eating-Induced Anxiety

just back bit ask question eat certain things?
certain foods make us feel good? foods actually make us feel anxious.
think people may familiar this. people might not, people
don't realize approach eating anxiety associated that.
alertness. Remember previous discussions, even don't haven't
seen those, moods feelings wellbeing anchored continuum
alertness versus calmness. hear often rest digest. know
that, oh, eat, feel really nice full, hopefully comfortably full not
full. relaxing. feel satiated, associated serotonin molecule
satiation. true. people don't know area
hypothalamus. deepen brain kind middle deep portion brain called
lateral hypothalamus. lateral hypothalamus really interesting
controls feeding, inhibits feeding. stops us feeding. another area
brain. want names, give you. don't want names, just ignore
them, delete memory awareness, called locus coeruleus, now
locus coeruleus sits back brainstem releases norepinephrine
essentially adrenaline. makes us feel alert. Now, locus coeruleus lot
different functions brain, going eat say walk
restaurant, sit preparing meal, locus coeruleus known release
noradrenaline brain. creating kind alertness. ancient utility,
creating alertness. many people, experience approach food
stress anxiety. interesting approach food locus coeruleus


releasing molecules make us feel anxious alert sometimes
felt excitement. asks probably feel food generally,
happy relationship food? trying restrict relationship
food, people coming dinner, will play course,
certain stress anxiety upon approach food. approach food feel
anxiety locus coeruleus activates lateral hypothalamus way inhibits
feeding makes us not want eat. lot people kind pre-meal
anxiety anxiety around food can't seem just calm good
meal access later rest digest. lot heightened
stress upon approach food lot tools there, eating
disorders just kind general public isn't suffering eating disorders,
things like mindfulness around meals. know, always tell never
eat stressed. sorry, life not organized way can that.
never eat. Right eat awake don't know stressed,
don't think tend run around lot day. don't generally take
time two three deep breaths eat. generally will just eat. can
healthy unhealthy depending quality digestion. think using digestion
guide good, lot people aren't aware interaction locus
coeruleus lateral hypothalamus basic mechanism supposed
get little bit alert anxious around mealtime. eat, mechanisms
calming satiation supposed kick mechanisms involve
mentioned earlier, two things. One things taste, digestion starts mouth.
course, taste food. Everyone tells us chew food more. Yes,
can improve digestion. not supposed drink many fluids eat.
true too, lot feel eat eat vagus
sensing gut. sending information time. sugar?
fats? contaminants? lot information. so-called
parallel pathways going brain regulate whether not want
eat something not. accelerators, things make us want
eat more, like sugar fats nutrient dense. helps
generally, least short term

00:27:30 Eat Brain Perceives “Amino Acid Threshold”



support survival animals, also amino acids. important.
lot data, much comes data people eat
much eat subconscious detection many amino acids
array, meaning constellation amino acids given food. fair say
sum total studies pointing direction people will basically eat, not
stomach full brain perceives adequate intake
amino acids. Now, conversation comes context know,
meat, keto, kind zone diet, Mediterranean diet, vegan diet.
largely going ignore kind strict camps today. will talk little bit it,
think one actually taps something important brain
body relationship ones don't. don't want get discussion
ethics different foods animal based non animal based. 'Cause not
topic today. really nutrient sensing amino acid sensing. generally
will eat gut tells brain adequate amounts amino acids.
Amino acids course important building blocks sure,
muscle, things body need repair. people don't
realize amino acids neurochemicals brain made from.
Now, vitally important. Okay, heard dopamine molecule
makes feel good. Actually dopamine molecule makes feel good.
released within brain. feel good dopamine release,
dopamine releases caused surprise, excitement, events looking forward
turnout well, inhibited events looking forward don't work
someone says going call really really excited talk to,
don't, thought movie gonna really great not,
expect meal really delicious. kind of, eh, actually

00:29:45 Reward Prediction Error: Buildup, Letdown Wanting

name that. called reward prediction error. can actually use

Dopamine going lead us want eat something not want

also detecting amino acids. particular amino acid called
L-tyrosine comes food. can look online, foods contain L-
tyrosine. meats. nuts. also plant-based foods. L-tyrosine
precursor couple molecules like L-DOPA, et cetera, make dopamine.
misconception serotonin gut.
dopamine gut. therefore mood gut. not quite way
works. Okay. talk serotonin moment dopamine synthesized
amino acids eat. However, dopamine neurons give rise
feelings good wanting desire motivation, reside brain.
don't want get confused. want respect honor power gut

not just movement challenges.

00:34:04 Supplementing L-Tyrosine, Drugs Abuse, Wellbutrin

challenges mood. Now, hopefully don't Parkinson's,
clear dietary L-tyrosine supports healthy production things like
dopamine well factors within brain. Now, people immediately
ask, well supplement L-tyrosine? just talk
gonna come up. Full disclosure, sometimes take L-tyrosine. not taking right now,
take occasionally, can buy capsule form. increase kind
mood elevation alertness. counter. check
doctor. not responsible healthcare not doctor, whether not
safe you, people preexisting hyper dopaminergic conditions like mania
probably not take L-tyrosine. thing taking L-tyrosine crash,
okay? not massive crash take appropriate doses right
can produce crash lethargy kind brain fog next day so.
L-tyrosine however can ingested foods supplementation
increase dopamine levels. well-known, taken chronically however, can disrupt
dopamine pathways. Now drugs will increase L-tyrosine
dopamine well. severe enough generally tend
addictive properties. things like methamphetamine, things like cocaine terrible


really ramp dopamine system much people really can't
achieve dopamine release mechanisms. food ingestion
L-tyrosine profound effect levels dopamine. takes little
really will impact level mood. Certain antidepressants fall category
dopaminergic antidepressants. One famous ones course Wellbutrin.
Wellbutrin developed lot antidepressants tend make
people feel kind lethargic side effect profiles people didn't like.
developed thing that, generic name different, generally called
Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin activates dopamine epinephrin, substrate
dopamine. involved motivation alertness effort.
might say, wow, sounds like great drug. However, drug, side effect profile
tends things associated elevated mood alertness. isn't
like taking L-tyrosine. isn't like eating tyrosine rich foods. really
much greater release dopamine epinephrin, increases things like anxiety,
sweating, pupils dilate. certain effects on, particular people epilepsy,
used somewhat successfully smoking cessation, again, not
everybody not encourage use things. just describing
biology rationale drugs developed. back
second. just kind take stock at. brain body connection.
many them, one main ones vagus nerve. vagus
collects information lot things, breathing, heart rate stuff happening
gut, et cetera, gut way, includes stomach intestines, sends
information brain. brain using information decide one two
things, move toward something move away. can also pause, essentially pausing
not moving toward. dopamine pathway foods rich L-tyrosine
generally give us elevated mood make us want whatever
happen well things, motivation, generalizes things
not unique just ingesting foods foods give us big pulse dopamine will
make us crave food. will make us crave activity led

like serotonin dopamine. commercial products there. me,
just me, not particularly impressed. know, not getting
hormones levels measured metabolic factors measured, can daunting.
can done rigorously. tests there. even some, believe
not. questionnaires that, think actually last year made
bigger newspapers, dopamine serotonin? that?
find stuff little silly although appreciate, like fact people
thinking talking neuromodulators aren't really great ways
measure things outside clinic. great clinical tools can
get inside hospital proper endocrinologist neurologist, no great at-
home tool. maybe call arms entrepreneurial folks
create tests, accurate tests please, done home.
people feel like anxious always motivated state
trying adjust serotonin. Many people adjust serotonin just eating
food

00:43:38 Eating Promote Dopamine (Daytime) & Serotonin (Night Time)



carbohydrate rich foods will increase serotonin. talked previous

00:44:30 Supplementing Serotonin: Sleep, & Caution Sleep Disruptions

don't like ingesting meat, starchy carbohydrates will increase serotonin.
people also will take serotonin. can now buy 5-HTP supplements.

good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman

colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work

afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.

fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit

people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact

support survival animals, also amino acids. important.
lot data, much comes data people eat
much eat subconscious detection many amino acids
array, meaning constellation amino acids given food. fair say
sum total studies pointing direction people will basically eat, not
stomach full brain perceives adequate intake
amino acids. Now, conversation comes context know,
meat, keto, kind zone diet, Mediterranean diet, vegan diet.
largely going ignore kind strict camps today. will talk little bit it,
think one actually taps something important brain
body relationship ones don't. don't want get discussion
ethics different foods animal based non animal based. 'Cause not
topic today. really nutrient sensing amino acid sensing. generally
will eat gut tells brain adequate amounts amino acids.
Amino acids course important building blocks sure,
muscle, things body need repair. people don't
realize amino acids neurochemicals brain made from.
Now, vitally important. Okay, heard dopamine molecule

expecting something, hear really great restaurant place
really, case, have, wouldn't call addiction. call


affliction croissants. best vegetable course, croissant. get really
excited fact someone will tell me, oh place
incredible croissants. gotta go there. get really excited, go. just
telling gonna really terrific raises expectation, dopamine
expectation. unless croissants amazing chances going
experience less good, less satisfying. will truly release less dopamine
just said, oh yeah, think croissants street.
just tried one random, reward prediction error
expectation something releases dopamine actual event releases dopamine.
event related dopamine not exceed expectation least match it,
much higher tendency won't pursue thing again. dopamine
really powerful not just molecule reward. molecule desire.

ask book recommendations. don't know author personally, love book.
called "The Molecule More". terrific book. wish written it, frankly,
want learn dopamine reward prediction error dopamine

Dopamine going lead us want eat something not want
something, dopamine really craving. motivation
desire. mentioned, amino acid sensors gut detecting
many amino acids

00:32:01 L-Tyrosine, Dopamine, Motivation, Mood, & Movement

also detecting amino acids. particular amino acid called
L-tyrosine comes food. can look online, foods contain L-
tyrosine. meats. nuts. also plant-based foods. L-tyrosine
precursor couple molecules like L-DOPA, et cetera, make dopamine.
misconception serotonin gut.
dopamine gut. therefore mood gut. not quite way
works. Okay. talk serotonin moment dopamine synthesized
amino acids eat. However, dopamine neurons give rise
feelings good wanting desire motivation, reside brain.
don't want get confused. want respect honor power gut


vagal pathway, really neurons within brain drive pursuit
decision-making, mean? Well, people make little dopamine.
people make little dopamine need prescription dopamine. need
L-DOPA, people Parkinson's take L-DOPA compounds increase
dopamine Parkinson's associated deficits movement, starts
tremor, actually starts things interesting. talk
moment, Parkinson's depression. blunting motivation mood
effect, tremor. eventually severe conditions challenges
speaking walking famous examples Muhammad Ali, Michael
J. Fox, great boxing trainer, Freddie Roach, like people Parkinson's
least later life challenges speaking. Now not just fighters
develop Parkinson's far know, Michael J. Fox wasn't fighter. People can
develop Parkinson's Parkinson's depletion dopamine neurons brain.
not just movement challenges.

00:34:04 Supplementing L-Tyrosine, Drugs Abuse, Wellbutrin

challenges mood. Now, hopefully don't Parkinson's,
clear dietary L-tyrosine supports healthy production things like
dopamine well factors within brain. Now, people immediately
ask, well supplement L-tyrosine? just talk
gonna come up. Full disclosure, sometimes take L-tyrosine. not taking right now,
take occasionally, can buy capsule form. increase kind
mood elevation alertness. counter. check
doctor. not responsible healthcare not doctor, whether not
safe you, people preexisting hyper dopaminergic conditions like mania
probably not take L-tyrosine. thing taking L-tyrosine crash,
okay? not massive crash take appropriate doses right
can produce crash lethargy kind brain fog next day so.
L-tyrosine however can ingested foods supplementation
increase dopamine levels. well-known, taken chronically however, can disrupt
dopamine pathways. Now drugs will increase L-tyrosine
dopamine well. severe enough generally tend
addictive properties. things like methamphetamine, things like cocaine terrible


really ramp dopamine system much people really can't
achieve dopamine release mechanisms. food ingestion
L-tyrosine profound effect levels dopamine. takes little
really will impact level mood. Certain antidepressants fall category
dopaminergic antidepressants. One famous ones course Wellbutrin.
Wellbutrin developed lot antidepressants tend make
people feel kind lethargic side effect profiles people didn't like.
developed thing that, generic name different, generally called
Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin activates dopamine epinephrin, substrate
dopamine. involved motivation alertness effort.
might say, wow, sounds like great drug. However, drug, side effect profile
tends things associated elevated mood alertness. isn't
like taking L-tyrosine. isn't like eating tyrosine rich foods. really
much greater release dopamine epinephrin, increases things like anxiety,
sweating, pupils dilate. certain effects on, particular people epilepsy,
used somewhat successfully smoking cessation, again, not
everybody not encourage use things. just describing
biology rationale drugs developed. back
second. just kind take stock at. brain body connection.
many them, one main ones vagus nerve. vagus
collects information lot things, breathing, heart rate stuff happening
gut, et cetera, gut way, includes stomach intestines, sends
information brain. brain using information decide one two
things, move toward something move away. can also pause, essentially pausing
not moving toward. dopamine pathway foods rich L-tyrosine
generally give us elevated mood make us want whatever
happen well things, motivation, generalizes things
not unique just ingesting foods foods give us big pulse dopamine will
make us crave food. will make us crave activity led
ingestion food. mentioned earlier, lot happening
subconscious level not even aware of. think concern
hidden sugars ingestion sugars serious not just
sugars impacting blood glucose negative ways. Although often is, not just
obesity crisis happening. also fact disrupting dopamine

neurochemicals subconsciously. like talk
pathways brain body regulate moods emotions also
actionable. neuromodulator really interesting context
vagus serotonin. Serotonin, just remind neuromodulator therefore creates
bias neural circuits neurons brain body going active
makes less likely ones going active. think fair say
without ever measured bulldog Costello, just brain body must
swimming serotonin, calm eats lot generally
feels pretty sated. kind animal obsessed comforts. bit
hedonist, serotonin elevated tends make us feel really comfortable

mainly put us pursuit things. Motivation pursuit. Serotonin
feeling really comfy are. conversation around brain body relationship
mood serotonin many years was, well, eat big meal. gut
distended. got nutrients need rest digest serotonin

interesting actionable going on. First all, you, perhaps not
heard 90% serotonin make gut. indeed
lot serotonin gut. neurons gut makes serotonin.
neurons brain make serotonin, deal.
serotonin impacts mood mental state not gut.
neurons brain area called raphae nucleus brain,
locations too, neurons control whether not feel
satiated not. Whether not feel happy calm. can't discussion
serotonin without discussion antidepressants.
late eighties early nineties explosion number prescription
drugs released. Things like first one famous one Prozac, Zoloft
Paxil, number ones so-called SSRI selective serotonin re-uptake


inhibitors. long acronym, basically drugs work preventing
gobbling serotonin re-uptake serotonin neurons released
leads serotonin overall means elevate serotonin. indeed
drugs can useful certain people feel better cases
depression clinical disorders well. really don't want dismiss
useless dangerous everybody. can quite useful many people.
Not everyone responds well sure heard. side effect
profile affects like blunting affect. can make people feel kind flat, kinda meh,
can reduce appetite food. can reduce appetite sex. can sorts things,
can work really well. Sometimes dose-related issue, et cetera. Serotonin
fascinating however, well neurons raphe work impacted
events within gut. Although might surprised find
events are. go little bit deeper gut. again, gut includes
stomach small intestine large intestine ask like, going
serotonin gut? impacting serotonin brain? think
context us might want increase decrease serotonin
levels. far know, aren't really good home blood tests things
like serotonin dopamine. commercial products there. me,
just me, not particularly impressed. know, not getting
hormones levels measured metabolic factors measured, can daunting.
can done rigorously. tests there. even some, believe
not. questionnaires that, think actually last year made
bigger newspapers, dopamine serotonin? that?
find stuff little silly although appreciate, like fact people
thinking talking neuromodulators aren't really great ways
measure things outside clinic. great clinical tools can
get inside hospital proper endocrinologist neurologist, no great at-
home tool. maybe call arms entrepreneurial folks
create tests, accurate tests please, done home.
people feel like anxious always motivated state
trying adjust serotonin. Many people adjust serotonin just eating
food

00:43:38 Eating Promote Dopamine (Daytime) & Serotonin (Night Time)



carbohydrate rich foods will increase serotonin. talked previous
podcast personally big fan least usually fast exercise
early part day eat relatively high protein moderate fat zero carb low carb
meal lunch afternoon stay alert foods tend favor dopamine
production acetylcholine production, epinephrin production alertness. mood
generally pretty good time. evening comes around
concerned sleep good night's sleep, not concerned anxious way,
want get good night's sleep. will ingest foods promote serotonin release
contain lot tryptophan. eat meat, like white
meat, turkey meat. don't tend to, never liked turkey. don't mind animal

00:44:30 Supplementing Serotonin: Sleep, & Caution Sleep Disruptions

don't like ingesting meat, starchy carbohydrates will increase serotonin.
people also will take serotonin. can now buy 5-HTP supplements.
little bit tricky. 5-HTP supplements can course increase 5-HTP. 5-HTP
serotonin sometimes can create problems endogenous self-made
production serotonin. never fan taking things close chemical
trying increase long periods time. Maybe occasional use.
problem take serotonin supplements, 5-HTP, fall asleep. sleep
intense wake three four hours later. know based sleep
studies good measurements lab serotonin release tends later
part night. taking early night really can disrupt pattern
sleep depth sleep. Nonetheless, people interested taking serotonin
get blissed effects. can achieve foods.

00:51:00 Emotional Context Book Recommendation: “How Emotions Made”

going relates emotions. last episode said
something gonna repeat now briefly, much talk


good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman
Podcast. discussions Instagram Live, Northeastern
University, world expert emotions. first book "How Emotions Made"
not book sent me. paid money years ago, bought it, read
it, loved long met Lisa, just delighted got known
little bit. really interesting read psychology emotions
subjectivity emotions. So, whereas talking mainly biology emotions
gets little bit psychology biology well. Lisa's just
terrific. also putting lot information world emotion.
want learn check work, again, Lisa Feldman Barrett.
book "How Emotions Made" Hopefully continue write many
books. now understand relationship hope foods dopamine,
foods serotonin communicated brain via
vagus, right? ingest foods, supplements things people take,
don't put directly brain. put gut. yes, gut
brain connection not serotonin gut makes feel calm
placid. not dopamine gut. just oversold way
think something really attractive. understand idea
certain things experience life emotions happening body.
maybe little control, right? thing hard container.
can't just stuff dopamine there. probably take Mucuna pruriens
bean stuff ear, please don't that. It'd make ear itchy
serotonin outside. can't get stuff there. ingest
things metabolized certain ways communicate brain maybe
pass brain across called blood brain barrier. talk
blood brain barrier minute. actually called BBB. ends


sounding like baby, BBB. guess like BB, anyway, BBB, also nerves
gut sensing nutrient contents food saying, oh,
feel better want more. Oh, got lot bitterness acid taste it.
want less that. transitioned discussion dopamine
serotonin gut hopefully got actionable items belt,
pun intended, can understand certain foods certain nutrients
can look up, might impact mood. somebody really anxious
really wired. Well, dopamine adrenaline pathway epinephrine pathway
probably not one want lean harder. tend someone
pretty passive trouble motivation. Well think ramping
dopamine pathway through, always think behaviors proper food choices
best way start. behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.

00:54:55 Exercise: Powerful Mood Enhancer, Lacks Specificity

one problems discussion around mood exercise mood
meditation subjective. like, love certain forms exercise not
others. Certain ones aversive me. Certain ones attractive me, never
really clear. No one's ever told me. Okay, 10 minutes bike X
number RPM so-and-so skier order get dopamine up.
can actually say, ingest L-tyrosine high probability going
make dopamine. talking ingesting food
supplementation like. Mucuna pruriens, tried. just mention
dopaminergic me. got really, really jazzed severe crash
next day. that's, think tend ride pretty high kind alertness
motivation scale. always told Costello people podcast
studio slow speech down. uncaffeinated, probably afford
little serotonin life. So, whereas Costello, can afford wake every
couple days just say hello us. dog sleeps creature.
remarkable. things can actionable.
ways quantitative can regulate dosages can
regulate amounts can regulate timing. everyone play
things figure right terms feeding. everyone
explore understand safe right them. But, course, exercise


still important. talked social connection last episode super important
activation serotonin comes gut brain, body brain relationship,
eat really matters terms neurochemicals make.

00:56:45 Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil Alleviating Depression

talk little bit things ingest body allow
body inform brain shift mood. something
years. just want say found complete game changer.
excellent science support it. think people familiar different
context don't think people know simple fact omega-3
omega-6 fatty acid ratio profound effect depression. profound effect
mood much double-blind placebo controlled study will provide
link too, study first published 2008 there've many others well.
First all, experiment done animals. found model learned
helplessness animals. not kind animals, put rats mice
jar. let swim swim, swim, swim try save life.
eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially
done humans although didn't swim point near drowning.
took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,
appetite, sorts negative health effects. comparison thousand
milligrams day EPA. EPA one elements contains high levels
omega-3's things like fish oil, talk sources little bit
wasn't thousand milligrams fish oil. thousand milligrams EPA. Compared
20 milligrams Fluoxetine Prozac, okay. Really increases serotonin.
study 60 individuals, again, provide links study. found
equally effective reducing depressive symptoms. imagine that,
food-based compound can't make without, right, not situation
can make omega-3s. get food sources
supplementation, effective 20 milligrams fluoxetine course eight


weeks. really interesting addition combination
thousand milligrams EPA Fluoxetine synergistic effect lowering
depressive symptoms. find remarkable. heard first came
wasn't sure make it. 'Cause lot studies come
generally like focus changes behavior around things large
center mass. lot information. couple years later, fact start taking
thousand milligrams per day EPA fish oil. Now side effects fish
oil. People blood, bleeders Factor V Leiden mutations
women taking birth control, can affect blood clotting things
sort really talk doctor make sure okay you. Fish oil also can give
people fishy breath pretty gross, frankly, now fish oils either
Encapsulations put lemon flavoring
doesn't effect. event, thousand milligrams per day EPA. started
ingesting regularly. just felt better. wasn't clinically depressed, generally,
feel least me, increase mood affect. number things
supposed reduce inflammation. cardiovascular effects controversial long
time everyone thought effects platelets really terrific.
articles came major newspapers saying maybe not much effects
mood really profound. now lots studies.

01:01:00 Fish Oil Antidepressant

go PubMed put EPA fish oil depression find
number really impressive results showing least
effective certain SSRI antidepressants dosages can amplify improve
effect low dosages SSRIs. feel like people
know this. nutrition, profoundly affecting mood depression
terrible, right? Depression can component anxiety cases
people feel lousy uncertain. kind talk depression
anxiety talk someone anxious can tell everything's
gonna okay. always concerned might not know.
don't really know plane isn't gonna crash. don't really know life gonna go
okay. sense, right, no one crystal ball can predict
future, tend perseverate fixate uncertainty. course


versions depression involve certainty. People lethargic
certain say, yeah, certain, never gonna get another job. certain,
never gonna meet anyone new. certain gonna fail. kind divide
sphere depression around certainty uncertainty. interesting
thousand milligrams per day EPA shown relieve forms
depression. Now, mean gonna work everybody? No, not
try play psychiatrist. want point direction manuscripts
can make informed choices yourself. can discuss doctor
family make choices right you. especially
interesting heart effects, heard omega-3s,

01:02:40 EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain

course can get sources too, can get fatty fish,
flax seeds, hemp seeds. number chia seeds, kinds things
levels EPA required quite high. thousand milligrams per day
pretty hard get food although can done depending
eating. interesting heart effects solid really stand
literature lot something talked previous episode.
mention again, heart rate variability. know heart rate
really high heart rate, really low. Neither good. lot people
think, oh just want low heart rate, big stroke volume. know, running
lot may 30 40 beats per minute. great shape still want
heart rate variability. lot tone autonomic nervous system
talked last time. How, inhale, speeds heart rate. exhale,
decreases heart rate. called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. basis
heart rate variability. maybe short post this. can get
mechanism behaviors spill might useful you.
point heart rate variability. HRV good. interesting
study 2009 showed people eat diet fail supplement
way high omega-6 three ratio, not enough omega-3s, not
markers inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 TNF-alpha,
tend non-responders antidepressants. Shifting omega-3 omega-6 ratio
couple things. First all, increasing amount EPA shifted ratio.


higher omega-3 omega-6 ratio, good, lowered inflammation markers,
allowed antidepressants effect, even low doses.
really interesting thing. worked increasing heart rate variability, think, well,
world happen? know mean, ton effects
way works way things impacting gut
autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, said, vagus includes connections
heart signaling sensory information fast heart beating
brain not just stuff lungs, information heart brain
adjusts heart rate heart rate variability. incredible way one
can use gut, ingestion EPA's, either food
supplementation increase rate variability thereby improve symptoms, meaning
reduce symptoms depression, even make low levels antidepressants
wouldn't otherwise work work. think like study much a, super
cool. bridges brain body access. incorporates nutrition micronutrients
brain also really points something hear time,
body whole system. working whole system brain isn't working
isolation skull. reacting things happening body
gut heart rate heart rate variability. things ingest can
profound effect them. Now, course, really want emphasize something
no one compound nutrient supplement drug behavior
matter going end shifting depression improving one's
mood improving sleep. constellation things. especially true
people start get excited supplements drugs kinds potential
various things. Right now, lot excitement psychedelics
therapeutic uses. think great, good friend mine physician
clinician says better living chemistry still requires better living. cannot
expect take compound regardless source potency completely shift
experience life without continue engage proper behaviors,
things know proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.
many others well. still find collection studies omega-3
omega-6 ratios profoundly important much completely changed
way think food, foods eat, supplement. don't necessarily think
everybody really think incredible compounds
robust effects feelings wellbeing.



01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either
food supplementation. acknowledge not everyone wants take fish oil.
couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment
makes not want ingest fish related products. krill oil. Krill still
organism. little tiny thing whales eat lot people generally eat little
of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.
preference. people really like krill oil source omega-3s. mention
sources like chia seeds flax seeds, notice
not things tend ingest lot regular basis. possible get omega-3s
meats. animals grazed grasses contain lot omega-3s.
ingest meat source meat gonna important
relates omega-3s. Even within category fish oil concern
sometimes mercury contaminants. want go brand
emphasizes gone really good sources decontaminate
regardless. search brands. test can


01:09:05 L-Carnitine Mood, Sperm Ovary Quality, Autism, Fibromyalgia,
Migraine

whether not fish oil rancid not. people take liquid form.
people take capsule form. liquid form gonna affordable. capsule
form little easier little portable. can actually just chew one
gel tablets. tastes really fishy kind rancid, know disgusting.
want spit out. doesn't tolerable know okay.
Unfortunately buy first order that. Although, don't know, maybe
can get open bottle store tell want try


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall
around brain barrier brain important.
feature neurons don't recreate injury, like
organs body. not lot turnover cells despite might've
heard. nature created BBB, blood brain barrier make sure
certain molecules particular, large molecules don't get across blood-brain barrier.
'Cause can damaging tissues. Incidentally, also rigid

exist make just eat something, just ingest
doesn't mean going cross blood-brain barrier, L-carnitine taken
acetylated converted form gets across blood-brain barrier.
lot effects, involved mitochondrial activation long chain fatty acids
big mouthful, get time talking metabolic,

depression still emerging seem exist people feel notable
decrease depressive symptoms. seven studies listed examine.com
notable benefit variety circumstances participants heightened
depression already. start taking L-carnitine start feeling better.
talk dosages various studies. also shown notable
decrease symptoms autism, find fascinating. Also again, things
ingest impact chemicals brain impact rest body.
things used treat certain forms alcohol dependence.
think going exciting emerging area. gonna whole month

01:21:55 Probiotics, Brain Fog, Autism, Fermentation

will go far deeper gut microbiome gut brain axis. things
think might find surprising. First all, supporting healthy gut microbiome
good mood, great digestion great immune system function. However,
not mean maxing taking probiotic prebiotic can
possibly manage. mentioned many times believe probiotics, take
probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case
better. things like brain fog can come that, brain fog just
inability focus. People feel really not well generally. studies
little bit controversial think fair say people really increase amount
probiotic taking beyond certain amount start feeling foggy
mind. Now much? Well get probiotics mentioned Athletic
Greens, can get fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,
different sources around world. Actually, love hear

comments. terrific. things can really
damage gut microbiome. huge misconception want
clear up. study published "Nature", among three
top journals science. know, "Nature", "Science"

01:25:20 Artificial Sweeteners & Gut Microbiome: NOT Bad; Depends!

"Cell" considered top tops, excellent journal showed artificial

microbiome ways detrimental number different health markers,
increasing inflammatory cytokines bad things happen gut
microbiome thrown off kilter. study widely discussed
things not mentioned really important. study

Now enough chemical similarity saccharin ones
mentioned, not them. instance, Stevia, monk fruit distinct

negative effects gut microbiome, still tested. saccharin
really, shown study several studies can really negatively impact
quality gut microbiome. Interestingly, narrative around artificial sweeteners
gut microbiome incorrect. people thought, oh, saccharin bad

01:28:00 Ketogenic, Vegan, & Processed Food Effects, Individual Differences

willing go there. 'Cause think deserves conversation, nowadays
many examples people switched kind standard

necessarily mean ingestion meats, can. experience
positive effects themselves. Not everybody. talked previously
kind incorrect, believe incorrect marketing keto relates

people love keto works great them. ketogenic diet interesting
one shifts ketogenic diet shift gut microbiome.
people end feeling better. people end feeling worse. Likewise,
people go ingesting animal products including meat vegetarian
go vegan experience positive shifts mood affect. know
transition plant-based diet especially enrichment fiber
present diets also creates dramatic shifts gut microbiome. people
feel better that. people feel worse. course, gonna depend
whether not ingesting lot processed foods not. paper

advice. note fasting. colleague Yale, expert

01:33:20 Fasting-Based Depletion Microbiome

gut microbiome. told something really interesting,
fast, actually digest certain components within dietary tract. actually depletes
good amount gut microbiome. interesting. good results
guess call intermittent kind circadian type fasting never
done long fast, push first meal hours first meal
generally around lunchtime longer periods fasting go day
two three days known deplete gut microbiome major ways. not
always necessarily bad thing replenished, often replenished

mental effects returning eating feeding sometimes people don't
feel good start eating. really want food, start eating
again. don't feel good fast. may related
depletion microbiome occurs long fast. again, something
think talk doctor, idea fasting across board
good. may merits that, certainly cases,
deplete microbiome depletion microbiome significant
means return eating, actually not position digest
assimilate foods. foods not position impact
brain body way prior fast. is, think people
suggest kind gradual transition back consuming nutrients fast.
round up, want share results without question will impact

central theme studies tell about.

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues
experiment took housekeepers, essentially hotel workers,


divide two groups. watch short film. one case, film

not just placebo effect. incredible set findings illustrate
extent whether not believe food gonna good us not good
us. Well, can't escape reality. can't tell poison gonna
good ingest poison expect not kill you, can tell
eating 12 croissants, confess done it, long run, long time

gonna make lose weight. belief effects not lying
cases, experiments notice subjects didn't prior knowledge
grehlin effects daily routine weight loss blood

can't simply lie tell want believe
important, also important mind body fascinating
interplay. today talked mainly body things put

support survival animals, also amino acids. important.
lot data, much comes data people eat
much eat subconscious detection many amino acids
array, meaning constellation amino acids given food. fair say
sum total studies pointing direction people will basically eat, not
stomach full brain perceives adequate intake
amino acids. Now, conversation comes context know,
meat, keto, kind zone diet, Mediterranean diet, vegan diet.
largely going ignore kind strict camps today. will talk little bit it,
think one actually taps something important brain
body relationship ones don't. don't want get discussion
ethics different foods animal based non animal based. 'Cause not
topic today. really nutrient sensing amino acid sensing. generally
will eat gut tells brain adequate amounts amino acids.
Amino acids course important building blocks sure,
muscle, things body need repair. people don't
realize amino acids neurochemicals brain made from.
Now, vitally important. Okay, heard dopamine molecule
makes feel good. Actually dopamine molecule makes feel good.
released within brain. feel good dopamine release,
dopamine releases caused surprise, excitement, events looking forward
turnout well, inhibited events looking forward don't work
someone says going call really really excited talk to,
don't, thought movie gonna really great not,
expect meal really delicious. kind of, eh, actually

00:29:45 Reward Prediction Error: Buildup, Letdown Wanting

name that. called reward prediction error. can actually use
context meals plans way useful people
know, essentially expect something really terrific really place higher
expectation chemical level. don't get much dopamine
expecting something, hear really great restaurant place
really, case, have, wouldn't call addiction. call


affliction croissants. best vegetable course, croissant. get really
excited fact someone will tell me, oh place
incredible croissants. gotta go there. get really excited, go. just
telling gonna really terrific raises expectation, dopamine
expectation. unless croissants amazing chances going
experience less good, less satisfying. will truly release less dopamine
just said, oh yeah, think croissants street.
just tried one random, reward prediction error
expectation something releases dopamine actual event releases dopamine.
event related dopamine not exceed expectation least match it,
much higher tendency won't pursue thing again. dopamine
really powerful not just molecule reward. molecule desire.
molecule wanting not just molecule having. book, since people often
ask book recommendations. don't know author personally, love book.
called "The Molecule More". terrific book. wish written it, frankly,
want learn dopamine reward prediction error dopamine
regulates various aspects emotional motivational life, terrific read.
Dopamine going lead us want eat something not want
something, dopamine really craving. motivation
desire. mentioned, amino acid sensors gut detecting
many amino acids

00:32:01 L-Tyrosine, Dopamine, Motivation, Mood, & Movement

also detecting amino acids. particular amino acid called
L-tyrosine comes food. can look online, foods contain L-
tyrosine. meats. nuts. also plant-based foods. L-tyrosine
precursor couple molecules like L-DOPA, et cetera, make dopamine.
misconception serotonin gut.
dopamine gut. therefore mood gut. not quite way
works. Okay. talk serotonin moment dopamine synthesized
amino acids eat. However, dopamine neurons give rise
feelings good wanting desire motivation, reside brain.
don't want get confused. want respect honor power gut


vagal pathway, really neurons within brain drive pursuit
decision-making, mean? Well, people make little dopamine.
people make little dopamine need prescription dopamine. need
L-DOPA, people Parkinson's take L-DOPA compounds increase
dopamine Parkinson's associated deficits movement, starts
tremor, actually starts things interesting. talk
moment, Parkinson's depression. blunting motivation mood
effect, tremor. eventually severe conditions challenges
speaking walking famous examples Muhammad Ali, Michael
J. Fox, great boxing trainer, Freddie Roach, like people Parkinson's
least later life challenges speaking. Now not just fighters
develop Parkinson's far know, Michael J. Fox wasn't fighter. People can
develop Parkinson's Parkinson's depletion dopamine neurons brain.
not just movement challenges.

00:34:04 Supplementing L-Tyrosine, Drugs Abuse, Wellbutrin

challenges mood. Now, hopefully don't Parkinson's,
clear dietary L-tyrosine supports healthy production things like
dopamine well factors within brain. Now, people immediately
ask, well supplement L-tyrosine? just talk
gonna come up. Full disclosure, sometimes take L-tyrosine. not taking right now,
take occasionally, can buy capsule form. increase kind
mood elevation alertness. counter. check
doctor. not responsible healthcare not doctor, whether not
safe you, people preexisting hyper dopaminergic conditions like mania
probably not take L-tyrosine. thing taking L-tyrosine crash,
okay? not massive crash take appropriate doses right
can produce crash lethargy kind brain fog next day so.
L-tyrosine however can ingested foods supplementation
increase dopamine levels. well-known, taken chronically however, can disrupt
dopamine pathways. Now drugs will increase L-tyrosine
dopamine well. severe enough generally tend
addictive properties. things like methamphetamine, things like cocaine terrible


really ramp dopamine system much people really can't
achieve dopamine release mechanisms. food ingestion
L-tyrosine profound effect levels dopamine. takes little
really will impact level mood. Certain antidepressants fall category
dopaminergic antidepressants. One famous ones course Wellbutrin.
Wellbutrin developed lot antidepressants tend make
people feel kind lethargic side effect profiles people didn't like.
developed thing that, generic name different, generally called
Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin activates dopamine epinephrin, substrate
dopamine. involved motivation alertness effort.
might say, wow, sounds like great drug. However, drug, side effect profile
tends things associated elevated mood alertness. isn't
like taking L-tyrosine. isn't like eating tyrosine rich foods. really
much greater release dopamine epinephrin, increases things like anxiety,
sweating, pupils dilate. certain effects on, particular people epilepsy,
used somewhat successfully smoking cessation, again, not
everybody not encourage use things. just describing
biology rationale drugs developed. back
second. just kind take stock at. brain body connection.

stomach small intestine large intestine ask like, going
serotonin gut? impacting serotonin brain? think
context us might want increase decrease serotonin
levels. far know, aren't really good home blood tests things
like serotonin dopamine. commercial products there. me,
just me, not particularly impressed. know, not getting
hormones levels measured metabolic factors measured, can daunting.
can done rigorously. tests there. even some, believe
not. questionnaires that, think actually last year made
bigger newspapers, dopamine serotonin? that?
find stuff little silly although appreciate, like fact people
thinking talking neuromodulators aren't really great ways
measure things outside clinic. great clinical tools can
get inside hospital proper endocrinologist neurologist, no great at-
home tool. maybe call arms entrepreneurial folks
create tests, accurate tests please, done home.
people feel like anxious always motivated state
trying adjust serotonin. Many people adjust serotonin just eating
food

00:43:38 Eating Promote Dopamine (Daytime) & Serotonin (Night Time)



carbohydrate rich foods will increase serotonin. talked previous
podcast personally big fan least usually fast exercise

00:44:30 Supplementing Serotonin: Sleep, & Caution Sleep Disruptions

don't like ingesting meat, starchy carbohydrates will increase serotonin.
people also will take serotonin. can now buy 5-HTP supplements.
little bit tricky. 5-HTP supplements can course increase 5-HTP. 5-HTP

something gonna repeat now briefly, much talk


good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman
Podcast. discussions Instagram Live, Northeastern
University, world expert emotions. first book "How Emotions Made"
not book sent me. paid money years ago, bought it, read
it, loved long met Lisa, just delighted got known
little bit. really interesting read psychology emotions
subjectivity emotions. So, whereas talking mainly biology emotions
gets little bit psychology biology well. Lisa's just
terrific. also putting lot information world emotion.
want learn check work, again, Lisa Feldman Barrett.
book "How Emotions Made" Hopefully continue write many
books. now understand relationship hope foods dopamine,

years. just want say found complete game changer.
excellent science support it. think people familiar different

First all, experiment done animals. found model learned

jar. let swim swim, swim, swim try save life.
eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially
done humans although didn't swim point near drowning.
took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,
appetite, sorts negative health effects. comparison thousand

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues

incredible croissants. gotta go there. get really excited, go. just
telling gonna really terrific raises expectation, dopamine
expectation. unless croissants amazing chances going

just said, oh yeah, think croissants street.
just tried one random, reward prediction error
expectation something releases dopamine actual event releases dopamine.
event related dopamine not exceed expectation least match it,
much higher tendency won't pursue thing again. dopamine
really powerful not just molecule reward. molecule desire.
molecule wanting not just molecule having. book, since people often
ask book recommendations. don't know author personally, love book.
called "The Molecule More". terrific book. wish written it, frankly,
want learn dopamine reward prediction error dopamine

Dopamine going lead us want eat something not want
something, dopamine really craving. motivation
desire. mentioned, amino acid sensors gut detecting
many amino acids

00:32:01 L-Tyrosine, Dopamine, Motivation, Mood, & Movement

also detecting amino acids. particular amino acid called
L-tyrosine comes food. can look online, foods contain L-
tyrosine. meats. nuts. also plant-based foods. L-tyrosine
precursor couple molecules like L-DOPA, et cetera, make dopamine.
misconception serotonin gut.
dopamine gut. therefore mood gut. not quite way
works. Okay. talk serotonin moment dopamine synthesized
amino acids eat. However, dopamine neurons give rise
feelings good wanting desire motivation, reside brain.
don't want get confused. want respect honor power gut


vagal pathway, really neurons within brain drive pursuit
decision-making, mean? Well, people make little dopamine.
people make little dopamine need prescription dopamine. need
L-DOPA, people Parkinson's take L-DOPA compounds increase
dopamine Parkinson's associated deficits movement, starts
tremor, actually starts things interesting. talk
moment, Parkinson's depression. blunting motivation mood
effect, tremor. eventually severe conditions challenges
speaking walking famous examples Muhammad Ali, Michael
J. Fox, great boxing trainer, Freddie Roach, like people Parkinson's
least later life challenges speaking. Now not just fighters
develop Parkinson's far know, Michael J. Fox wasn't fighter. People can
develop Parkinson's Parkinson's depletion dopamine neurons brain.
not just movement challenges.

00:34:04 Supplementing L-Tyrosine, Drugs Abuse, Wellbutrin

challenges mood. Now, hopefully don't Parkinson's,
clear dietary L-tyrosine supports healthy production things like
dopamine well factors within brain. Now, people immediately
ask, well supplement L-tyrosine? just talk
gonna come up. Full disclosure, sometimes take L-tyrosine. not taking right now,
take occasionally, can buy capsule form. increase kind
mood elevation alertness. counter. check
doctor. not responsible healthcare not doctor, whether not
safe you, people preexisting hyper dopaminergic conditions like mania
probably not take L-tyrosine. thing taking L-tyrosine crash,
okay? not massive crash take appropriate doses right
can produce crash lethargy kind brain fog next day so.
L-tyrosine however can ingested foods supplementation
increase dopamine levels. well-known, taken chronically however, can disrupt
dopamine pathways. Now drugs will increase L-tyrosine
dopamine well. severe enough generally tend
addictive properties. things like methamphetamine, things like cocaine terrible


really ramp dopamine system much people really can't
achieve dopamine release mechanisms. food ingestion
L-tyrosine profound effect levels dopamine. takes little
really will impact level mood. Certain antidepressants fall category
dopaminergic antidepressants. One famous ones course Wellbutrin.
Wellbutrin developed lot antidepressants tend make
people feel kind lethargic side effect profiles people didn't like.
developed thing that, generic name different, generally called
Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin activates dopamine epinephrin, substrate
dopamine. involved motivation alertness effort.
might say, wow, sounds like great drug. However, drug, side effect profile
tends things associated elevated mood alertness. isn't
like taking L-tyrosine. isn't like eating tyrosine rich foods. really
much greater release dopamine epinephrin, increases things like anxiety,
sweating, pupils dilate. certain effects on, particular people epilepsy,
used somewhat successfully smoking cessation, again, not
everybody not encourage use things. just describing
biology rationale drugs developed. back
second. just kind take stock at. brain body connection.
many them, one main ones vagus nerve. vagus
collects information lot things, breathing, heart rate stuff happening
gut, et cetera, gut way, includes stomach intestines, sends
information brain. brain using information decide one two
things, move toward something move away. can also pause, essentially pausing
not moving toward. dopamine pathway foods rich L-tyrosine
generally give us elevated mood make us want whatever
happen well things, motivation, generalizes things
not unique just ingesting foods foods give us big pulse dopamine will
make us crave food. will make us crave activity led
ingestion food. mentioned earlier, lot happening
subconscious level not even aware of. think concern
hidden sugars ingestion sugars serious not just
sugars impacting blood glucose negative ways. Although often is, not just
obesity crisis happening. also fact disrupting dopamine

00:38:29 Serotonin: Gut, Brain, Satiety Prozac

neurochemicals subconsciously. like talk
pathways brain body regulate moods emotions also
actionable. neuromodulator really interesting context
vagus serotonin. Serotonin, just remind neuromodulator therefore creates
bias neural circuits neurons brain body going active
makes less likely ones going active. think fair say
without ever measured bulldog Costello, just brain body must
swimming serotonin, calm eats lot generally
feels pretty sated. kind animal obsessed comforts. bit
hedonist, serotonin elevated tends make us feel really comfortable
kind blissed wherever are. contrast dopamine epinephrin
mainly put us pursuit things. Motivation pursuit. Serotonin
feeling really comfy are. conversation around brain body relationship
mood serotonin many years was, well, eat big meal. gut
distended. got nutrients need rest digest serotonin
released. sorta true, lot going lot
interesting actionable going on. First all, you, perhaps not
heard 90% serotonin make gut. indeed
lot serotonin gut. neurons gut makes serotonin.
neurons brain make serotonin, deal.
serotonin impacts mood mental state not gut.
neurons brain area called raphae nucleus brain,
locations too, neurons control whether not feel
satiated not. Whether not feel happy calm. can't discussion
serotonin without discussion antidepressants.
late eighties early nineties explosion number prescription
drugs released. Things like first one famous one Prozac, Zoloft
Paxil, number ones so-called SSRI selective serotonin re-uptake


inhibitors. long acronym, basically drugs work preventing
gobbling serotonin re-uptake serotonin neurons released
leads serotonin overall means elevate serotonin. indeed
drugs can useful certain people feel better cases
depression clinical disorders well. really don't want dismiss
useless dangerous everybody. can quite useful many people.
Not everyone responds well sure heard. side effect
profile affects like blunting affect. can make people feel kind flat, kinda meh,
can reduce appetite food. can reduce appetite sex. can sorts things,
can work really well. Sometimes dose-related issue, et cetera. Serotonin
fascinating however, well neurons raphe work impacted
events within gut. Although might surprised find
events are. go little bit deeper gut. again, gut includes
stomach small intestine large intestine ask like, going
serotonin gut? impacting serotonin brain? think
context us might want increase decrease serotonin
levels. far know, aren't really good home blood tests things
like serotonin dopamine. commercial products there. me,
just me, not particularly impressed. know, not getting
hormones levels measured metabolic factors measured, can daunting.
can done rigorously. tests there. even some, believe
not. questionnaires that, think actually last year made
bigger newspapers, dopamine serotonin? that?
find stuff little silly although appreciate, like fact people
thinking talking neuromodulators aren't really great ways
measure things outside clinic. great clinical tools can
get inside hospital proper endocrinologist neurologist, no great at-
home tool. maybe call arms entrepreneurial folks
create tests, accurate tests please, done home.
people feel like anxious always motivated state
trying adjust serotonin. Many people adjust serotonin just eating
food

00:43:38 Eating Promote Dopamine (Daytime) & Serotonin (Night Time)



carbohydrate rich foods will increase serotonin. talked previous
podcast personally big fan least usually fast exercise
early part day eat relatively high protein moderate fat zero carb low carb
meal lunch afternoon stay alert foods tend favor dopamine
production acetylcholine production, epinephrin production alertness. mood
generally pretty good time. evening comes around
concerned sleep good night's sleep, not concerned anxious way,
want get good night's sleep. will ingest foods promote serotonin release
contain lot tryptophan. eat meat, like white
meat, turkey meat. don't tend to, never liked turkey. don't mind animal

00:44:30 Supplementing Serotonin: Sleep, & Caution Sleep Disruptions

don't like ingesting meat, starchy carbohydrates will increase serotonin.
people also will take serotonin. can now buy 5-HTP supplements.
little bit tricky. 5-HTP supplements can course increase 5-HTP. 5-HTP
serotonin sometimes can create problems endogenous self-made
production serotonin. never fan taking things close chemical
trying increase long periods time. Maybe occasional use.
problem take serotonin supplements, 5-HTP, fall asleep. sleep
intense wake three four hours later. know based sleep
studies good measurements lab serotonin release tends later
part night. taking early night really can disrupt pattern
sleep depth sleep. Nonetheless, people interested taking serotonin
get blissed effects. can achieve foods.

00:51:00 Emotional Context Book Recommendation: “How Emotions Made”

going relates emotions. last episode said
something gonna repeat now briefly, much talk


good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman
Podcast. discussions Instagram Live, Northeastern
University, world expert emotions. first book "How Emotions Made"
not book sent me. paid money years ago, bought it, read
it, loved long met Lisa, just delighted got known
little bit. really interesting read psychology emotions
subjectivity emotions. So, whereas talking mainly biology emotions
gets little bit psychology biology well. Lisa's just
terrific. also putting lot information world emotion.
want learn check work, again, Lisa Feldman Barrett.
book "How Emotions Made" Hopefully continue write many
books. now understand relationship hope foods dopamine,
foods serotonin communicated brain via
vagus, right? ingest foods, supplements things people take,
don't put directly brain. put gut. yes, gut
brain connection not serotonin gut makes feel calm
placid. not dopamine gut. just oversold way
think something really attractive. understand idea

really wired. Well, dopamine adrenaline pathway epinephrine pathway
probably not one want lean harder. tend someone
pretty passive trouble motivation. Well think ramping
dopamine pathway through, always think behaviors proper food choices
best way start. behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.

00:56:45 Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil Alleviating Depression

talk little bit things ingest body allow
body inform brain shift mood. something
years. just want say found complete game changer.
excellent science support it. think people familiar different
context don't think people know simple fact omega-3
omega-6 fatty acid ratio profound effect depression. profound effect
mood much double-blind placebo controlled study will provide
link too, study first published 2008 there've many others well.
First all, experiment done animals. found model learned
helplessness animals. not kind animals, put rats mice
jar. let swim swim, swim, swim try save life.
eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially
done humans although didn't swim point near drowning.
took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,
appetite, sorts negative health effects. comparison thousand
milligrams day EPA. EPA one elements contains high levels
omega-3's things like fish oil, talk sources little bit
wasn't thousand milligrams fish oil. thousand milligrams EPA. Compared
20 milligrams Fluoxetine Prozac, okay. Really increases serotonin.
study 60 individuals, again, provide links study. found
equally effective reducing depressive symptoms. imagine that,
food-based compound can't make without, right, not situation
can make omega-3s. get food sources
supplementation, effective 20 milligrams fluoxetine course eight


weeks. really interesting addition combination

people fishy breath pretty gross, frankly, now fish oils either
Encapsulations put lemon flavoring

feel least me, increase mood affect. number things
supposed reduce inflammation. cardiovascular effects controversial long
time everyone thought effects platelets really terrific.
articles came major newspapers saying maybe not much effects
mood really profound. now lots studies.

01:01:00 Fish Oil Antidepressant

go PubMed put EPA fish oil depression find
number really impressive results showing least

mention again, heart rate variability. know heart rate
really high heart rate, really low. Neither good. lot people

01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either
food supplementation. acknowledge not everyone wants take fish oil.
couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment
makes not want ingest fish related products. krill oil. Krill still
organism. little tiny thing whales eat lot people generally eat little
of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.
preference. people really like krill oil source omega-3s. mention
sources like chia seeds flax seeds, notice
not things tend ingest lot regular basis. possible get omega-3s
meats. animals grazed grasses contain lot omega-3s.
ingest meat source meat gonna important
relates omega-3s. Even within category fish oil concern
sometimes mercury contaminants. want go brand
emphasizes gone really good sources decontaminate
regardless. search brands. test can


01:09:05 L-Carnitine Mood, Sperm Ovary Quality, Autism, Fibromyalgia,

whether not fish oil rancid not. people take liquid form.
people take capsule form. liquid form gonna affordable. capsule
form little easier little portable. can actually just chew one
gel tablets. tastes really fishy kind rancid, know disgusting.
want spit out. doesn't tolerable know okay.
Unfortunately buy first order that. Although, don't know, maybe
can get open bottle store tell want try


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues

challenges mood. Now, hopefully don't Parkinson's,
clear dietary L-tyrosine supports healthy production things like
dopamine well factors within brain. Now, people immediately
ask, well supplement L-tyrosine? just talk
gonna come up. Full disclosure, sometimes take L-tyrosine. not taking right now,
take occasionally, can buy capsule form. increase kind
mood elevation alertness. counter. check
doctor. not responsible healthcare not doctor, whether not
safe you, people preexisting hyper dopaminergic conditions like mania
probably not take L-tyrosine. thing taking L-tyrosine crash,
okay? not massive crash take appropriate doses right
can produce crash lethargy kind brain fog next day so.
L-tyrosine however can ingested foods supplementation
increase dopamine levels. well-known, taken chronically however, can disrupt
dopamine pathways. Now drugs will increase L-tyrosine
dopamine well. severe enough generally tend
addictive properties. things like methamphetamine, things like cocaine terrible


really ramp dopamine system much people really can't
achieve dopamine release mechanisms. food ingestion
L-tyrosine profound effect levels dopamine. takes little
really will impact level mood. Certain antidepressants fall category
dopaminergic antidepressants. One famous ones course Wellbutrin.
Wellbutrin developed lot antidepressants tend make
people feel kind lethargic side effect profiles people didn't like.
developed thing that, generic name different, generally called
Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin activates dopamine epinephrin, substrate
dopamine. involved motivation alertness effort.
might say, wow, sounds like great drug. However, drug, side effect profile
tends things associated elevated mood alertness. isn't
like taking L-tyrosine. isn't like eating tyrosine rich foods. really

interesting actionable going on. First all, you, perhaps not
heard 90% serotonin make gut. indeed
lot serotonin gut. neurons gut makes serotonin.
neurons brain make serotonin, deal.
serotonin impacts mood mental state not gut.
neurons brain area called raphae nucleus brain,
locations too, neurons control whether not feel

fascinating however, well neurons raphe work impacted
events within gut. Although might surprised find
events are. go little bit deeper gut. again, gut includes
stomach small intestine large intestine ask like, going
serotonin gut? impacting serotonin brain? think
context us might want increase decrease serotonin
levels. far know, aren't really good home blood tests things
like serotonin dopamine. commercial products there. me,
just me, not particularly impressed. know, not getting
hormones levels measured metabolic factors measured, can daunting.
can done rigorously. tests there. even some, believe
not. questionnaires that, think actually last year made
bigger newspapers, dopamine serotonin? that?
find stuff little silly although appreciate, like fact people
thinking talking neuromodulators aren't really great ways
measure things outside clinic. great clinical tools can
get inside hospital proper endocrinologist neurologist, no great at-
home tool. maybe call arms entrepreneurial folks
create tests, accurate tests please, done home.
people feel like anxious always motivated state
trying adjust serotonin. Many people adjust serotonin just eating

00:44:30 Supplementing Serotonin: Sleep, & Caution Sleep Disruptions

don't like ingesting meat, starchy carbohydrates will increase serotonin.

something gonna repeat now briefly, much talk


good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't

can look up, might impact mood. somebody really anxious
really wired. Well, dopamine adrenaline pathway epinephrine pathway
probably not one want lean harder. tend someone
pretty passive trouble motivation. Well think ramping
dopamine pathway through, always think behaviors proper food choices
best way start. behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.

00:54:55 Exercise: Powerful Mood Enhancer, Lacks Specificity

one problems discussion around mood exercise mood
meditation subjective. like, love certain forms exercise not
others. Certain ones aversive me. Certain ones attractive me, never
really clear. No one's ever told me. Okay, 10 minutes bike X
number RPM so-and-so skier order get dopamine up.
can actually say, ingest L-tyrosine high probability going
make dopamine. talking ingesting food
supplementation like. Mucuna pruriens, tried. just mention
dopaminergic me. got really, really jazzed severe crash
next day. that's, think tend ride pretty high kind alertness
motivation scale. always told Costello people podcast
studio slow speech down. uncaffeinated, probably afford
little serotonin life. So, whereas Costello, can afford wake every
couple days just say hello us. dog sleeps creature.
remarkable. things can actionable.
ways quantitative can regulate dosages can
regulate amounts can regulate timing. everyone play
things figure right terms feeding. everyone
explore understand safe right them. But, course, exercise


still important. talked social connection last episode super important
activation serotonin comes gut brain, body brain relationship,
eat really matters terms neurochemicals make.

00:56:45 Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil Alleviating Depression

talk little bit things ingest body allow
body inform brain shift mood. something
years. just want say found complete game changer.
excellent science support it. think people familiar different
context don't think people know simple fact omega-3
omega-6 fatty acid ratio profound effect depression. profound effect
mood much double-blind placebo controlled study will provide
link too, study first published 2008 there've many others well.
First all, experiment done animals. found model learned
helplessness animals. not kind animals, put rats mice
jar. let swim swim, swim, swim try save life.
eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially
done humans although didn't swim point near drowning.
took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,
appetite, sorts negative health effects. comparison thousand
milligrams day EPA. EPA one elements contains high levels
omega-3's things like fish oil, talk sources little bit
wasn't thousand milligrams fish oil. thousand milligrams EPA. Compared
20 milligrams Fluoxetine Prozac, okay. Really increases serotonin.
study 60 individuals, again, provide links study. found
equally effective reducing depressive symptoms. imagine that,
food-based compound can't make without, right, not situation
can make omega-3s. get food sources
supplementation, effective 20 milligrams fluoxetine course eight


weeks. really interesting addition combination
thousand milligrams EPA Fluoxetine synergistic effect lowering
depressive symptoms. find remarkable. heard first came
wasn't sure make it. 'Cause lot studies come
generally like focus changes behavior around things large
center mass. lot information. couple years later, fact start taking
thousand milligrams per day EPA fish oil. Now side effects fish
oil. People blood, bleeders Factor V Leiden mutations
women taking birth control, can affect blood clotting things
sort really talk doctor make sure okay you. Fish oil also can give
people fishy breath pretty gross, frankly, now fish oils either
Encapsulations put lemon flavoring
doesn't effect. event, thousand milligrams per day EPA. started
ingesting regularly. just felt better. wasn't clinically depressed, generally,
feel least me, increase mood affect. number things
supposed reduce inflammation. cardiovascular effects controversial long
time everyone thought effects platelets really terrific.
articles came major newspapers saying maybe not much effects
mood really profound. now lots studies.

01:01:00 Fish Oil Antidepressant

go PubMed put EPA fish oil depression find
number really impressive results showing least
effective certain SSRI antidepressants dosages can amplify improve
effect low dosages SSRIs. feel like people
know this. nutrition, profoundly affecting mood depression
terrible, right? Depression can component anxiety cases
people feel lousy uncertain. kind talk depression
anxiety talk someone anxious can tell everything's
gonna okay. always concerned might not know.
don't really know plane isn't gonna crash. don't really know life gonna go
okay. sense, right, no one crystal ball can predict
future, tend perseverate fixate uncertainty. course


versions depression involve certainty. People lethargic
certain say, yeah, certain, never gonna get another job. certain,
never gonna meet anyone new. certain gonna fail. kind divide
sphere depression around certainty uncertainty. interesting
thousand milligrams per day EPA shown relieve forms
depression. Now, mean gonna work everybody? No, not
try play psychiatrist. want point direction manuscripts
can make informed choices yourself. can discuss doctor
family make choices right you. especially
interesting heart effects, heard omega-3s,

01:02:40 EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain

course can get sources too, can get fatty fish,
flax seeds, hemp seeds. number chia seeds, kinds things
levels EPA required quite high. thousand milligrams per day
pretty hard get food although can done depending
eating. interesting heart effects solid really stand
literature lot something talked previous episode.
mention again, heart rate variability. know heart rate
really high heart rate, really low. Neither good. lot people
think, oh just want low heart rate, big stroke volume. know, running
lot may 30 40 beats per minute. great shape still want
heart rate variability. lot tone autonomic nervous system
talked last time. How, inhale, speeds heart rate. exhale,
decreases heart rate. called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. basis
heart rate variability. maybe short post this. can get
mechanism behaviors spill might useful you.
point heart rate variability. HRV good. interesting
study 2009 showed people eat diet fail supplement
way high omega-6 three ratio, not enough omega-3s, not
markers inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 TNF-alpha,
tend non-responders antidepressants. Shifting omega-3 omega-6 ratio
couple things. First all, increasing amount EPA shifted ratio.


higher omega-3 omega-6 ratio, good, lowered inflammation markers,
allowed antidepressants effect, even low doses.
really interesting thing. worked increasing heart rate variability, think, well,
world happen? know mean, ton effects
way works way things impacting gut
autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, said, vagus includes connections
heart signaling sensory information fast heart beating
brain not just stuff lungs, information heart brain
adjusts heart rate heart rate variability. incredible way one
can use gut, ingestion EPA's, either food
supplementation increase rate variability thereby improve symptoms, meaning
reduce symptoms depression, even make low levels antidepressants
wouldn't otherwise work work. think like study much a, super
cool. bridges brain body access. incorporates nutrition micronutrients
brain also really points something hear time,
body whole system. working whole system brain isn't working
isolation skull. reacting things happening body
gut heart rate heart rate variability. things ingest can
profound effect them. Now, course, really want emphasize something
no one compound nutrient supplement drug behavior
matter going end shifting depression improving one's
mood improving sleep. constellation things. especially true
people start get excited supplements drugs kinds potential
various things. Right now, lot excitement psychedelics
therapeutic uses. think great, good friend mine physician
clinician says better living chemistry still requires better living. cannot
expect take compound regardless source potency completely shift
experience life without continue engage proper behaviors,
things know proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.
many others well. still find collection studies omega-3
omega-6 ratios profoundly important much completely changed
way think food, foods eat, supplement. don't necessarily think
everybody really think incredible compounds
robust effects feelings wellbeing.



01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either
food supplementation. acknowledge not everyone wants take fish oil.
couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment
makes not want ingest fish related products. krill oil. Krill still
organism. little tiny thing whales eat lot people generally eat little
of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.
preference. people really like krill oil source omega-3s. mention
sources like chia seeds flax seeds, notice
not things tend ingest lot regular basis. possible get omega-3s
meats. animals grazed grasses contain lot omega-3s.
ingest meat source meat gonna important
relates omega-3s. Even within category fish oil concern
sometimes mercury contaminants. want go brand
emphasizes gone really good sources decontaminate
regardless. search brands. test can


01:09:05 L-Carnitine Mood, Sperm Ovary Quality, Autism, Fibromyalgia,
Migraine

whether not fish oil rancid not. people take liquid form.
people take capsule form. liquid form gonna affordable. capsule
form little easier little portable. can actually just chew one
gel tablets. tastes really fishy kind rancid, know disgusting.
want spit out. doesn't tolerable know okay.
Unfortunately buy first order that. Although, don't know, maybe
can get open bottle store tell want try


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall
around brain barrier brain important.
feature neurons don't recreate injury, like
organs body. not lot turnover cells despite might've
heard. nature created BBB, blood brain barrier make sure
certain molecules particular, large molecules don't get across blood-brain barrier.
'Cause can damaging tissues. Incidentally, also rigid
stringent barrier around organs, gonads. ovaries
testes brain organs body nature gone way
protect, give additional layer blood-brain barrier might imagine
testes ovaries, going blood gonadal barrier. barriers
exist make just eat something, just ingest
doesn't mean going cross blood-brain barrier, L-carnitine taken
acetylated converted form gets across blood-brain barrier.
lot effects, involved mitochondrial activation long chain fatty acids
big mouthful, get time talking metabolic,
interesting effects neuro side. decide check
examine.com see really interesting things, lots effects ammonia, C-


reactive proteins, things sort, blood glucose lowered, et cetera. stuff
level blood periphery, slight effects lowering cholesterol.
interesting ones. Rates pregnancy go way people taking L-carnitine
father mother source sperm source egg affected
ways favors pregnancy. increase, go sperm quality
sperm motility males seems positive effects females
polycystic ovary syndrome. check out. know, effects strong.
three studies listed there. Again, not promoting this, people
take L-carnitine, especially trying get pregnant check
effects studies mentioned published peer reviewed rigorous
journals. terms neural effects. quite interesting. effects
depression still emerging seem exist people feel notable
decrease depressive symptoms. seven studies listed examine.com
notable benefit variety circumstances participants heightened
depression already. start taking L-carnitine start feeling better.
talk dosages various studies. also shown notable
decrease symptoms autism, find fascinating. Also again, things
ingest impact chemicals brain impact rest body.
things used treat certain forms alcohol dependence.
think going exciting emerging area. gonna whole month
addiction. got great guest lined month, now
emerging field people can take supplement help ease cravings
withdrawal trying quit drugs abuse, like cocaine, alcohol, heroin,
smoking things sort. really interesting area. is, like think
early days gonna discover lot more. huge list things here. Since
talked pain previous episode know lot people written
fibromyalgia. L carnitine shown reduce symptoms
fibromyalgia. Again, links studies examine.com, totally free site.
bulldog battering ram. nothing graceful bulldog.
decided wanted leave go get drink water. please forgive noise.
Okay. now turn another aspect gut-brain relationship will surprise
you, cases might shock you. really cool actionable
biology. gut microbiome, probiotics prebiotics. know today
talking emotions not pain remiss didn't mention another effect


acetylcarnitine reported can find listed link study
examine.com effect reducing symptoms migraine.
randomized controlled trial 133 participants frequent migraines.
taking 500 milligrams L-carnitine nothing 12 weeks. control little bit,
control experiment little bit tricky significant effect reducing

lot listed study. think compounds powerful.
carry risks certain people, not others. again, find right


01:16:29 Gut-Microbiome: Myths, Truths & Tubes Within Us

think super interesting potential therapeutics various people.
deal gut microbiome gut brain axis. Today actually
talking lot already gut brain axis nothing
microbiomes. talking vagus nerve connects providing
sensory information body brain. brain also sends
nerve motor information control motility got heart rate fast
breathe deployment immune stuff killer cells things sort.
oftentimes hear gut brain axis days, discussion
gut microbiome. again, situation incredible biology,
happy much discussion gut microbiome. somewhat
dismayed concerned hear either false partially
false. gonna clear misconceptions, first understanding

mainly changing conditions gut environment. addition
that, impact neurotransmitters neurons live gut.
signal brain impact things like dopamine serotonin
talking previously. vast world now devoted try understand
sources food kinds foods good not good gut microbiome?


just talk general rules thumb related research quality research
peer reviewed. future episode

01:21:55 Probiotics, Brain Fog, Autism, Fermentation

will go far deeper gut microbiome gut brain axis. things
think might find surprising. First all, supporting healthy gut microbiome
good mood, great digestion great immune system function. However,
not mean maxing taking probiotic prebiotic can
possibly manage. mentioned many times believe probiotics, take
probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case
better. things like brain fog can come that, brain fog just
inability focus. People feel really not well generally. studies
little bit controversial think fair say people really increase amount
probiotic taking beyond certain amount start feeling foggy
mind. Now much? Well get probiotics mentioned Athletic
Greens, can get fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,
different sources around world. Actually, love hear
sources people know foods around world. fascinated
way different cultures arrived foods provide support
healthy microbiomes fermented. colleague Stanford, Justin
Sonnenberg, talked this. don't want quote
inappropriately, discussions it, published
ingestion fermented foods one best ways support healthy levels gut
microbiota without exceeding threshold cause things like brain fog.
foods fermented foods going best source. number
different ways one that. people don't like fermented foods, however
people supplement it. isn't case better. know that.
true healthy gut microbiota shown improve symptoms
certain psychiatric illnesses well certain conditions like particular features along
autism spectrum, interesting. effects probably due not just
improvement immune system function, conditions neurons
sense nutrients convey information brain increase levels serotonin


dopamine. gut microbiome provides kind foundation healthy gut
healthy gut brain access much people report start eating
small bits 'cause doesn't require lot fermented foods, overall mood
better, not unlike effects EPA. Although don't think looked directly
context clinical depression yet. someone knows study please mention
comments. terrific. things can really
damage gut microbiome. huge misconception want
clear up. study published "Nature", among three
top journals science. know, "Nature", "Science"

01:25:20 Artificial Sweeteners & Gut Microbiome: NOT Bad; Depends!

"Cell" considered top tops, excellent journal showed artificial
sweeteners particular artificial sweetener saccharin can disrupt gut
microbiome ways detrimental number different health markers,
increasing inflammatory cytokines bad things happen gut
microbiome thrown off kilter. study widely discussed
things not mentioned really important. study
saccharin particular. Saccharin not typical artificial sweetener used,
typical artificial sweeteners used things like aspartame, so-called
NutraSweet Sucralose, days Stevia, monk fruits, knowledge
please correct anyone knows studies, knowledge, negative
effects artificial sweeteners gut microbiome restricted saccharin.
Now enough chemical similarity saccharin ones
mentioned, not them. instance, Stevia, monk fruit distinct
chemical makeup probably don't any, lower effects,
negative effects gut microbiome, still tested. saccharin
really, shown study several studies can really negatively impact
quality gut microbiome. Interestingly, narrative around artificial sweeteners
gut microbiome incorrect. people thought, oh, saccharin bad
microbiome. must kill microbiome. hear people saying, oh, artificial
sweeteners kill microbiome. not true all. fact, study
published nature showed negative affects saccharin
microbiome blocked eliminated giving antibiotics. happens


certain artificial sweeteners particular saccharin disrupt microbiome make
environment within gut mucosal lining favorable bacteria microbiota
not good organism. important distinction. not just language
thing people say, oh, know, kills microbiome. doesn't kill
microbiome. shifts microbiome shifts microbiome can good
can bad. takes us another topic bit hot button topic

01:28:00 Ketogenic, Vegan, & Processed Food Effects, Individual Differences

willing go there. 'Cause think deserves conversation, nowadays
many examples people switched kind standard
diet even vegetarian diet vegan diet, keto diet. Now keto doesn't
necessarily mean ingestion meats, can. experience
positive effects themselves. Not everybody. talked previously
kind incorrect, believe incorrect marketing keto relates
cosmetic effects challenges sleep people
people love keto works great them. ketogenic diet interesting
one shifts ketogenic diet shift gut microbiome.
people end feeling better. people end feeling worse. Likewise,
people go ingesting animal products including meat vegetarian
go vegan experience positive shifts mood affect. know
transition plant-based diet especially enrichment fiber
present diets also creates dramatic shifts gut microbiome. people
feel better that. people feel worse. course, gonna depend
whether not ingesting lot processed foods not. paper
published "Cell", "Cell Press" journal obviously, excellent journal, showing
ingestion processed foods, regardless whether not come animal
sources non-animal sources processed foods tend create activity
within body surely roots nervous system lead over-
consumption calories weight gain. Even weight gain couldn't
explained increased calories. words, processed foods bad, regardless
whether not talking animal products non animal products, probably not
surprising given know sugar sensing amino acid sensing

advice. note fasting. colleague Yale, expert

01:33:20 Fasting-Based Depletion Microbiome

gut microbiome. told something really interesting,
fast, actually digest certain components within dietary tract. actually depletes
good amount gut microbiome. interesting. good results
guess call intermittent kind circadian type fasting never
done long fast, push first meal hours first meal
generally around lunchtime longer periods fasting go day
two three days known deplete gut microbiome major ways. not
always necessarily bad thing replenished, often replenished
levels exceeded previous level. think GI tract even
mental effects returning eating feeding sometimes people don't
feel good start eating. really want food, start eating
again. don't feel good fast. may related
depletion microbiome occurs long fast. again, something
think talk doctor, idea fasting across board
good. may merits that, certainly cases,
deplete microbiome depletion microbiome significant
means return eating, actually not position digest
assimilate foods. foods not position impact
brain body way prior fast. is, think people
suggest kind gradual transition back consuming nutrients fast.
round up, want share results without question will impact
way respond food mentally even physically. know
central theme studies tell about.

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues
experiment took housekeepers, essentially hotel workers,


divide two groups. watch short film. one case, film
work important help people feel comfortable hotel, et
cetera, et cetera. group heard activity

period followed short tutorial. found eight weeks later,
group told activity good showed lower blood
pressure. lost significant amount body fat reported enjoying
work far group. work, simply biased mentally
information given, physiology followed information.
not just placebo effect. incredible set findings illustrate
extent whether not believe food gonna good us not good
us. Well, can't escape reality. can't tell poison gonna
good ingest poison expect not kill you, can tell
eating 12 croissants, confess done it, long run, long time
ago can't tell necessarily going good
gonna make lose weight. belief effects not lying
cases, experiments notice subjects didn't prior knowledge
grehlin effects daily routine weight loss blood
pressure. order work naive information, right?
can't simply lie tell want believe
important, also important mind body fascinating
interplay. today talked mainly body things put

impacting cells, neurons, microbiota mucosal lining, heart, lungs
information feeding brain impact feel here.
also feel impacting body reacts levels core
physiology couldn't just tell gonna work,
believe certain substances, certain foods, certain nutrients profound

really ramp dopamine system much people really can't
achieve dopamine release mechanisms. food ingestion
L-tyrosine profound effect levels dopamine. takes little
really will impact level mood. Certain antidepressants fall category
dopaminergic antidepressants. One famous ones course Wellbutrin.
Wellbutrin developed lot antidepressants tend make
people feel kind lethargic side effect profiles people didn't like.
developed thing that, generic name different, generally called
Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin activates dopamine epinephrin, substrate
dopamine. involved motivation alertness effort.
might say, wow, sounds like great drug. However, drug, side effect profile
tends things associated elevated mood alertness. isn't
like taking L-tyrosine. isn't like eating tyrosine rich foods. really
much greater release dopamine epinephrin, increases things like anxiety,
sweating, pupils dilate. certain effects on, particular people epilepsy,
used somewhat successfully smoking cessation, again, not
everybody not encourage use things. just describing
biology rationale drugs developed. back
second. just kind take stock at. brain body connection.
many them, one main ones vagus nerve. vagus
collects information lot things, breathing, heart rate stuff happening
gut, et cetera, gut way, includes stomach intestines, sends
information brain. brain using information decide one two
things, move toward something move away. can also pause, essentially pausing
not moving toward. dopamine pathway foods rich L-tyrosine
generally give us elevated mood make us want whatever
happen well things, motivation, generalizes things
not unique just ingesting foods foods give us big pulse dopamine will
make us crave food. will make us crave activity led
ingestion food. mentioned earlier, lot happening
subconscious level not even aware of. think concern
hidden sugars ingestion sugars serious not just
sugars impacting blood glucose negative ways. Although often is, not just
obesity crisis happening. also fact disrupting dopamine

neurochemicals subconsciously. like talk
pathways brain body regulate moods emotions also
actionable. neuromodulator really interesting context
vagus serotonin. Serotonin, just remind neuromodulator therefore creates
bias neural circuits neurons brain body going active
makes less likely ones going active. think fair say
without ever measured bulldog Costello, just brain body must
swimming serotonin, calm eats lot generally
feels pretty sated. kind animal obsessed comforts. bit
hedonist, serotonin elevated tends make us feel really comfortable
kind blissed wherever are. contrast dopamine epinephrin
mainly put us pursuit things. Motivation pursuit. Serotonin
feeling really comfy are. conversation around brain body relationship
mood serotonin many years was, well, eat big meal. gut
distended. got nutrients need rest digest serotonin
released. sorta true, lot going lot
interesting actionable going on. First all, you, perhaps not
heard 90% serotonin make gut. indeed
lot serotonin gut. neurons gut makes serotonin.
neurons brain make serotonin, deal.
serotonin impacts mood mental state not gut.
neurons brain area called raphae nucleus brain,
locations too, neurons control whether not feel
satiated not. Whether not feel happy calm. can't discussion
serotonin without discussion antidepressants.
late eighties early nineties explosion number prescription
drugs released. Things like first one famous one Prozac, Zoloft
Paxil, number ones so-called SSRI selective serotonin re-uptake


inhibitors. long acronym, basically drugs work preventing
gobbling serotonin re-uptake serotonin neurons released
leads serotonin overall means elevate serotonin. indeed
drugs can useful certain people feel better cases
depression clinical disorders well. really don't want dismiss

stomach small intestine large intestine ask like, going
serotonin gut? impacting serotonin brain? think
context us might want increase decrease serotonin
levels. far know, aren't really good home blood tests things
like serotonin dopamine. commercial products there. me,
just me, not particularly impressed. know, not getting
hormones levels measured metabolic factors measured, can daunting.
can done rigorously. tests there. even some, believe
not. questionnaires that, think actually last year made
bigger newspapers, dopamine serotonin? that?
find stuff little silly although appreciate, like fact people
thinking talking neuromodulators aren't really great ways
measure things outside clinic. great clinical tools can
get inside hospital proper endocrinologist neurologist, no great at-
home tool. maybe call arms entrepreneurial folks
create tests, accurate tests please, done home.
people feel like anxious always motivated state
trying adjust serotonin. Many people adjust serotonin just eating
food

00:43:38 Eating Promote Dopamine (Daytime) & Serotonin (Night Time)



carbohydrate rich foods will increase serotonin. talked previous

something gonna repeat now briefly, much talk


good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman

terrific. also putting lot information world emotion.
want learn check work, again, Lisa Feldman Barrett.

called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues

not just placebo effect. incredible set findings illustrate
extent whether not believe food gonna good us not good
us. Well, can't escape reality. can't tell poison gonna
good ingest poison expect not kill you, can tell
eating 12 croissants, confess done it, long run, long time

can't simply lie tell want believe
important, also important mind body fascinating
interplay. today talked mainly body things put

actionable. neuromodulator really interesting context
vagus serotonin. Serotonin, just remind neuromodulator therefore creates
bias neural circuits neurons brain body going active
makes less likely ones going active. think fair say
without ever measured bulldog Costello, just brain body must

feeling really comfy are. conversation around brain body relationship
mood serotonin many years was, well, eat big meal. gut
distended. got nutrients need rest digest serotonin
released. sorta true, lot going lot
interesting actionable going on. First all, you, perhaps not
heard 90% serotonin make gut. indeed
lot serotonin gut. neurons gut makes serotonin.
neurons brain make serotonin, deal.
serotonin impacts mood mental state not gut.
neurons brain area called raphae nucleus brain,
locations too, neurons control whether not feel
satiated not. Whether not feel happy calm. can't discussion
serotonin without discussion antidepressants.
late eighties early nineties explosion number prescription

can reduce appetite food. can reduce appetite sex. can sorts things,
can work really well. Sometimes dose-related issue, et cetera. Serotonin
fascinating however, well neurons raphe work impacted
events within gut. Although might surprised find
events are. go little bit deeper gut. again, gut includes
stomach small intestine large intestine ask like, going
serotonin gut? impacting serotonin brain? think
context us might want increase decrease serotonin
levels. far know, aren't really good home blood tests things
like serotonin dopamine. commercial products there. me,
just me, not particularly impressed. know, not getting
hormones levels measured metabolic factors measured, can daunting.
can done rigorously. tests there. even some, believe
not. questionnaires that, think actually last year made
bigger newspapers, dopamine serotonin? that?
find stuff little silly although appreciate, like fact people
thinking talking neuromodulators aren't really great ways
measure things outside clinic. great clinical tools can
get inside hospital proper endocrinologist neurologist, no great at-
home tool. maybe call arms entrepreneurial folks
create tests, accurate tests please, done home.
people feel like anxious always motivated state
trying adjust serotonin. Many people adjust serotonin just eating
food

00:43:38 Eating Promote Dopamine (Daytime) & Serotonin (Night Time)



carbohydrate rich foods will increase serotonin. talked previous
podcast personally big fan least usually fast exercise
early part day eat relatively high protein moderate fat zero carb low carb
meal lunch afternoon stay alert foods tend favor dopamine
production acetylcholine production, epinephrin production alertness. mood
generally pretty good time. evening comes around
concerned sleep good night's sleep, not concerned anxious way,
want get good night's sleep. will ingest foods promote serotonin release
contain lot tryptophan. eat meat, like white
meat, turkey meat. don't tend to, never liked turkey. don't mind animal

00:44:30 Supplementing Serotonin: Sleep, & Caution Sleep Disruptions

don't like ingesting meat, starchy carbohydrates will increase serotonin.
people also will take serotonin. can now buy 5-HTP supplements.
little bit tricky. 5-HTP supplements can course increase 5-HTP. 5-HTP
serotonin sometimes can create problems endogenous self-made
production serotonin. never fan taking things close chemical
trying increase long periods time. Maybe occasional use.
problem take serotonin supplements, 5-HTP, fall asleep. sleep
intense wake three four hours later. know based sleep
studies good measurements lab serotonin release tends later
part night. taking early night really can disrupt pattern
sleep depth sleep. Nonetheless, people interested taking serotonin
get blissed effects. can achieve foods.
mentioned, carbohydrate rich. seeing isn't really discussion

00:51:00 Emotional Context Book Recommendation: “How Emotions Made”

going relates emotions. last episode said
something gonna repeat now briefly, much talk


good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman
Podcast. discussions Instagram Live, Northeastern
University, world expert emotions. first book "How Emotions Made"
not book sent me. paid money years ago, bought it, read
it, loved long met Lisa, just delighted got known
little bit. really interesting read psychology emotions
subjectivity emotions. So, whereas talking mainly biology emotions
gets little bit psychology biology well. Lisa's just
terrific. also putting lot information world emotion.
want learn check work, again, Lisa Feldman Barrett.
book "How Emotions Made" Hopefully continue write many
books. now understand relationship hope foods dopamine,
foods serotonin communicated brain via
vagus, right? ingest foods, supplements things people take,
don't put directly brain. put gut. yes, gut
brain connection not serotonin gut makes feel calm
placid. not dopamine gut. just oversold way
think something really attractive. understand idea
certain things experience life emotions happening body.
maybe little control, right? thing hard container.

feel better want more. Oh, got lot bitterness acid taste it.
want less that. transitioned discussion dopamine
serotonin gut hopefully got actionable items belt,
pun intended, can understand certain foods certain nutrients
can look up, might impact mood. somebody really anxious
really wired. Well, dopamine adrenaline pathway epinephrine pathway
probably not one want lean harder. tend someone
pretty passive trouble motivation. Well think ramping
dopamine pathway through, always think behaviors proper food choices
best way start. behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.

00:54:55 Exercise: Powerful Mood Enhancer, Lacks Specificity

one problems discussion around mood exercise mood
meditation subjective. like, love certain forms exercise not
others. Certain ones aversive me. Certain ones attractive me, never
really clear. No one's ever told me. Okay, 10 minutes bike X
number RPM so-and-so skier order get dopamine up.
can actually say, ingest L-tyrosine high probability going
make dopamine. talking ingesting food

eat really matters terms neurochemicals make.

00:56:45 Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil Alleviating Depression

talk little bit things ingest body allow
body inform brain shift mood. something
years. just want say found complete game changer.
excellent science support it. think people familiar different
context don't think people know simple fact omega-3
omega-6 fatty acid ratio profound effect depression. profound effect
mood much double-blind placebo controlled study will provide
link too, study first published 2008 there've many others well.
First all, experiment done animals. found model learned
helplessness animals. not kind animals, put rats mice
jar. let swim swim, swim, swim try save life.
eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially
done humans although didn't swim point near drowning.
took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,
appetite, sorts negative health effects. comparison thousand
milligrams day EPA. EPA one elements contains high levels
omega-3's things like fish oil, talk sources little bit
wasn't thousand milligrams fish oil. thousand milligrams EPA. Compared
20 milligrams Fluoxetine Prozac, okay. Really increases serotonin.
study 60 individuals, again, provide links study. found
equally effective reducing depressive symptoms. imagine that,
food-based compound can't make without, right, not situation
can make omega-3s. get food sources
supplementation, effective 20 milligrams fluoxetine course eight


weeks. really interesting addition combination
thousand milligrams EPA Fluoxetine synergistic effect lowering
depressive symptoms. find remarkable. heard first came
wasn't sure make it. 'Cause lot studies come
generally like focus changes behavior around things large
center mass. lot information. couple years later, fact start taking
thousand milligrams per day EPA fish oil. Now side effects fish
oil. People blood, bleeders Factor V Leiden mutations
women taking birth control, can affect blood clotting things
sort really talk doctor make sure okay you. Fish oil also can give
people fishy breath pretty gross, frankly, now fish oils either
Encapsulations put lemon flavoring
doesn't effect. event, thousand milligrams per day EPA. started
ingesting regularly. just felt better. wasn't clinically depressed, generally,
feel least me, increase mood affect. number things
supposed reduce inflammation. cardiovascular effects controversial long
time everyone thought effects platelets really terrific.
articles came major newspapers saying maybe not much effects
mood really profound. now lots studies.

01:01:00 Fish Oil Antidepressant

go PubMed put EPA fish oil depression find
number really impressive results showing least
effective certain SSRI antidepressants dosages can amplify improve
effect low dosages SSRIs. feel like people
know this. nutrition, profoundly affecting mood depression
terrible, right? Depression can component anxiety cases
people feel lousy uncertain. kind talk depression
anxiety talk someone anxious can tell everything's
gonna okay. always concerned might not know.
don't really know plane isn't gonna crash. don't really know life gonna go
okay. sense, right, no one crystal ball can predict
future, tend perseverate fixate uncertainty. course


versions depression involve certainty. People lethargic
certain say, yeah, certain, never gonna get another job. certain,
never gonna meet anyone new. certain gonna fail. kind divide
sphere depression around certainty uncertainty. interesting
thousand milligrams per day EPA shown relieve forms
depression. Now, mean gonna work everybody? No, not
try play psychiatrist. want point direction manuscripts
can make informed choices yourself. can discuss doctor
family make choices right you. especially
interesting heart effects, heard omega-3s,

01:02:40 EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain

course can get sources too, can get fatty fish,
flax seeds, hemp seeds. number chia seeds, kinds things
levels EPA required quite high. thousand milligrams per day
pretty hard get food although can done depending
eating. interesting heart effects solid really stand
literature lot something talked previous episode.
mention again, heart rate variability. know heart rate
really high heart rate, really low. Neither good. lot people
think, oh just want low heart rate, big stroke volume. know, running
lot may 30 40 beats per minute. great shape still want
heart rate variability. lot tone autonomic nervous system
talked last time. How, inhale, speeds heart rate. exhale,
decreases heart rate. called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. basis
heart rate variability. maybe short post this. can get
mechanism behaviors spill might useful you.
point heart rate variability. HRV good. interesting
study 2009 showed people eat diet fail supplement
way high omega-6 three ratio, not enough omega-3s, not
markers inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 TNF-alpha,
tend non-responders antidepressants. Shifting omega-3 omega-6 ratio
couple things. First all, increasing amount EPA shifted ratio.


higher omega-3 omega-6 ratio, good, lowered inflammation markers,
allowed antidepressants effect, even low doses.
really interesting thing. worked increasing heart rate variability, think, well,
world happen? know mean, ton effects
way works way things impacting gut
autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, said, vagus includes connections
heart signaling sensory information fast heart beating
brain not just stuff lungs, information heart brain
adjusts heart rate heart rate variability. incredible way one
can use gut, ingestion EPA's, either food
supplementation increase rate variability thereby improve symptoms, meaning
reduce symptoms depression, even make low levels antidepressants
wouldn't otherwise work work. think like study much a, super
cool. bridges brain body access. incorporates nutrition micronutrients
brain also really points something hear time,
body whole system. working whole system brain isn't working
isolation skull. reacting things happening body
gut heart rate heart rate variability. things ingest can
profound effect them. Now, course, really want emphasize something
no one compound nutrient supplement drug behavior
matter going end shifting depression improving one's
mood improving sleep. constellation things. especially true
people start get excited supplements drugs kinds potential
various things. Right now, lot excitement psychedelics
therapeutic uses. think great, good friend mine physician
clinician says better living chemistry still requires better living. cannot
expect take compound regardless source potency completely shift
experience life without continue engage proper behaviors,
things know proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.
many others well. still find collection studies omega-3
omega-6 ratios profoundly important much completely changed
way think food, foods eat, supplement. don't necessarily think
everybody really think incredible compounds
robust effects feelings wellbeing.



01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either
food supplementation. acknowledge not everyone wants take fish oil.
couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment
makes not want ingest fish related products. krill oil. Krill still
organism. little tiny thing whales eat lot people generally eat little
of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.
preference. people really like krill oil source omega-3s. mention
sources like chia seeds flax seeds, notice
not things tend ingest lot regular basis. possible get omega-3s
meats. animals grazed grasses contain lot omega-3s.
ingest meat source meat gonna important
relates omega-3s. Even within category fish oil concern
sometimes mercury contaminants. want go brand

want spit out. doesn't tolerable know okay.
Unfortunately buy first order that. Although, don't know, maybe
can get open bottle store tell want try


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form

afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.

fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact

00:43:38 Eating Promote Dopamine (Daytime) & Serotonin (Night Time)



carbohydrate rich foods will increase serotonin. talked previous

00:44:30 Supplementing Serotonin: Sleep, & Caution Sleep Disruptions

don't like ingesting meat, starchy carbohydrates will increase serotonin.
people also will take serotonin. can now buy 5-HTP supplements.
little bit tricky. 5-HTP supplements can course increase 5-HTP. 5-HTP
serotonin sometimes can create problems endogenous self-made
production serotonin. never fan taking things close chemical
trying increase long periods time. Maybe occasional use.
problem take serotonin supplements, 5-HTP, fall asleep. sleep
intense wake three four hours later. know based sleep

00:51:00 Emotional Context Book Recommendation: “How Emotions Made”

going relates emotions. last episode said
something gonna repeat now briefly, much talk


good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman

not book sent me. paid money years ago, bought it, read
it, loved long met Lisa, just delighted got known

gets little bit psychology biology well. Lisa's just
terrific. also putting lot information world emotion.
want learn check work, again, Lisa Feldman Barrett.
book "How Emotions Made" Hopefully continue write many
books. now understand relationship hope foods dopamine,
foods serotonin communicated brain via
vagus, right? ingest foods, supplements things people take,
don't put directly brain. put gut. yes, gut
brain connection not serotonin gut makes feel calm

excellent science support it. think people familiar different

First all, experiment done animals. found model learned

eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially

took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues

00:51:00 Emotional Context Book Recommendation: “How Emotions Made”

going relates emotions. last episode said
something gonna repeat now briefly, much talk


good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman
Podcast. discussions Instagram Live, Northeastern
University, world expert emotions. first book "How Emotions Made"
not book sent me. paid money years ago, bought it, read
it, loved long met Lisa, just delighted got known
little bit. really interesting read psychology emotions
subjectivity emotions. So, whereas talking mainly biology emotions
gets little bit psychology biology well. Lisa's just
terrific. also putting lot information world emotion.
want learn check work, again, Lisa Feldman Barrett.
book "How Emotions Made" Hopefully continue write many
books. now understand relationship hope foods dopamine,
foods serotonin communicated brain via
vagus, right? ingest foods, supplements things people take,
don't put directly brain. put gut. yes, gut
brain connection not serotonin gut makes feel calm
placid. not dopamine gut. just oversold way
think something really attractive. understand idea

can actually say, ingest L-tyrosine high probability going
make dopamine. talking ingesting food

00:56:45 Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil Alleviating Depression

talk little bit things ingest body allow
body inform brain shift mood. something
years. just want say found complete game changer.
excellent science support it. think people familiar different
context don't think people know simple fact omega-3
omega-6 fatty acid ratio profound effect depression. profound effect
mood much double-blind placebo controlled study will provide
link too, study first published 2008 there've many others well.
First all, experiment done animals. found model learned
helplessness animals. not kind animals, put rats mice
jar. let swim swim, swim, swim try save life.
eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially
done humans although didn't swim point near drowning.
took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,
appetite, sorts negative health effects. comparison thousand
milligrams day EPA. EPA one elements contains high levels
omega-3's things like fish oil, talk sources little bit
wasn't thousand milligrams fish oil. thousand milligrams EPA. Compared
20 milligrams Fluoxetine Prozac, okay. Really increases serotonin.
study 60 individuals, again, provide links study. found
equally effective reducing depressive symptoms. imagine that,
food-based compound can't make without, right, not situation
can make omega-3s. get food sources
supplementation, effective 20 milligrams fluoxetine course eight


weeks. really interesting addition combination
thousand milligrams EPA Fluoxetine synergistic effect lowering
depressive symptoms. find remarkable. heard first came
wasn't sure make it. 'Cause lot studies come
generally like focus changes behavior around things large
center mass. lot information. couple years later, fact start taking
thousand milligrams per day EPA fish oil. Now side effects fish
oil. People blood, bleeders Factor V Leiden mutations
women taking birth control, can affect blood clotting things
sort really talk doctor make sure okay you. Fish oil also can give
people fishy breath pretty gross, frankly, now fish oils either
Encapsulations put lemon flavoring
doesn't effect. event, thousand milligrams per day EPA. started
ingesting regularly. just felt better. wasn't clinically depressed, generally,
feel least me, increase mood affect. number things
supposed reduce inflammation. cardiovascular effects controversial long
time everyone thought effects platelets really terrific.
articles came major newspapers saying maybe not much effects
mood really profound. now lots studies.

01:01:00 Fish Oil Antidepressant

go PubMed put EPA fish oil depression find
number really impressive results showing least
effective certain SSRI antidepressants dosages can amplify improve
effect low dosages SSRIs. feel like people
know this. nutrition, profoundly affecting mood depression
terrible, right? Depression can component anxiety cases
people feel lousy uncertain. kind talk depression
anxiety talk someone anxious can tell everything's
gonna okay. always concerned might not know.
don't really know plane isn't gonna crash. don't really know life gonna go
okay. sense, right, no one crystal ball can predict
future, tend perseverate fixate uncertainty. course


versions depression involve certainty. People lethargic
certain say, yeah, certain, never gonna get another job. certain,
never gonna meet anyone new. certain gonna fail. kind divide
sphere depression around certainty uncertainty. interesting
thousand milligrams per day EPA shown relieve forms
depression. Now, mean gonna work everybody? No, not
try play psychiatrist. want point direction manuscripts
can make informed choices yourself. can discuss doctor
family make choices right you. especially
interesting heart effects, heard omega-3s,

01:02:40 EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain

course can get sources too, can get fatty fish,
flax seeds, hemp seeds. number chia seeds, kinds things
levels EPA required quite high. thousand milligrams per day
pretty hard get food although can done depending
eating. interesting heart effects solid really stand
literature lot something talked previous episode.
mention again, heart rate variability. know heart rate
really high heart rate, really low. Neither good. lot people
think, oh just want low heart rate, big stroke volume. know, running
lot may 30 40 beats per minute. great shape still want
heart rate variability. lot tone autonomic nervous system
talked last time. How, inhale, speeds heart rate. exhale,
decreases heart rate. called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. basis
heart rate variability. maybe short post this. can get
mechanism behaviors spill might useful you.
point heart rate variability. HRV good. interesting
study 2009 showed people eat diet fail supplement
way high omega-6 three ratio, not enough omega-3s, not
markers inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 TNF-alpha,
tend non-responders antidepressants. Shifting omega-3 omega-6 ratio
couple things. First all, increasing amount EPA shifted ratio.


higher omega-3 omega-6 ratio, good, lowered inflammation markers,
allowed antidepressants effect, even low doses.
really interesting thing. worked increasing heart rate variability, think, well,
world happen? know mean, ton effects
way works way things impacting gut
autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, said, vagus includes connections
heart signaling sensory information fast heart beating
brain not just stuff lungs, information heart brain
adjusts heart rate heart rate variability. incredible way one
can use gut, ingestion EPA's, either food
supplementation increase rate variability thereby improve symptoms, meaning
reduce symptoms depression, even make low levels antidepressants
wouldn't otherwise work work. think like study much a, super
cool. bridges brain body access. incorporates nutrition micronutrients
brain also really points something hear time,
body whole system. working whole system brain isn't working
isolation skull. reacting things happening body
gut heart rate heart rate variability. things ingest can
profound effect them. Now, course, really want emphasize something
no one compound nutrient supplement drug behavior
matter going end shifting depression improving one's
mood improving sleep. constellation things. especially true
people start get excited supplements drugs kinds potential
various things. Right now, lot excitement psychedelics
therapeutic uses. think great, good friend mine physician
clinician says better living chemistry still requires better living. cannot
expect take compound regardless source potency completely shift
experience life without continue engage proper behaviors,
things know proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.
many others well. still find collection studies omega-3
omega-6 ratios profoundly important much completely changed
way think food, foods eat, supplement. don't necessarily think
everybody really think incredible compounds
robust effects feelings wellbeing.



01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either

couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment

of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.

compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall

will go far deeper gut microbiome gut brain axis. things
think might find surprising. First all, supporting healthy gut microbiome
good mood, great digestion great immune system function. However,
not mean maxing taking probiotic prebiotic can
possibly manage. mentioned many times believe probiotics, take
probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case

inability focus. People feel really not well generally. studies
little bit controversial think fair say people really increase amount
probiotic taking beyond certain amount start feeling foggy
mind. Now much? Well get probiotics mentioned Athletic
Greens, can get fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,
different sources around world. Actually, love hear

central theme studies tell about.

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues
experiment took housekeepers, essentially hotel workers,


divide two groups. watch short film. one case, film
work important help people feel comfortable hotel, et

group told activity good showed lower blood
pressure. lost significant amount body fat reported enjoying
work far group. work, simply biased mentally
information given, physiology followed information.
not just placebo effect. incredible set findings illustrate
extent whether not believe food gonna good us not good
us. Well, can't escape reality. can't tell poison gonna
good ingest poison expect not kill you, can tell
eating 12 croissants, confess done it, long run, long time
ago can't tell necessarily going good
gonna make lose weight. belief effects not lying
cases, experiments notice subjects didn't prior knowledge
grehlin effects daily routine weight loss blood

can't simply lie tell want believe
important, also important mind body fascinating
interplay. today talked mainly body things put

00:51:00 Emotional Context Book Recommendation: “How Emotions Made”

going relates emotions. last episode said
something gonna repeat now briefly, much talk


good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman
Podcast. discussions Instagram Live, Northeastern
University, world expert emotions. first book "How Emotions Made"
not book sent me. paid money years ago, bought it, read
it, loved long met Lisa, just delighted got known
little bit. really interesting read psychology emotions
subjectivity emotions. So, whereas talking mainly biology emotions
gets little bit psychology biology well. Lisa's just
terrific. also putting lot information world emotion.
want learn check work, again, Lisa Feldman Barrett.
book "How Emotions Made" Hopefully continue write many
books. now understand relationship hope foods dopamine,
foods serotonin communicated brain via
vagus, right? ingest foods, supplements things people take,
don't put directly brain. put gut. yes, gut
brain connection not serotonin gut makes feel calm
placid. not dopamine gut. just oversold way
think something really attractive. understand idea
certain things experience life emotions happening body.
maybe little control, right? thing hard container.

want less that. transitioned discussion dopamine
serotonin gut hopefully got actionable items belt,
pun intended, can understand certain foods certain nutrients
can look up, might impact mood. somebody really anxious
really wired. Well, dopamine adrenaline pathway epinephrine pathway
probably not one want lean harder. tend someone
pretty passive trouble motivation. Well think ramping
dopamine pathway through, always think behaviors proper food choices
best way start. behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.

00:54:55 Exercise: Powerful Mood Enhancer, Lacks Specificity

can actually say, ingest L-tyrosine high probability going
make dopamine. talking ingesting food
supplementation like. Mucuna pruriens, tried. just mention
dopaminergic me. got really, really jazzed severe crash

eat really matters terms neurochemicals make.

00:56:45 Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil Alleviating Depression

talk little bit things ingest body allow
body inform brain shift mood. something
years. just want say found complete game changer.
excellent science support it. think people familiar different
context don't think people know simple fact omega-3
omega-6 fatty acid ratio profound effect depression. profound effect
mood much double-blind placebo controlled study will provide
link too, study first published 2008 there've many others well.
First all, experiment done animals. found model learned
helplessness animals. not kind animals, put rats mice
jar. let swim swim, swim, swim try save life.
eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially
done humans although didn't swim point near drowning.
took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,
appetite, sorts negative health effects. comparison thousand
milligrams day EPA. EPA one elements contains high levels
omega-3's things like fish oil, talk sources little bit
wasn't thousand milligrams fish oil. thousand milligrams EPA. Compared
20 milligrams Fluoxetine Prozac, okay. Really increases serotonin.
study 60 individuals, again, provide links study. found
equally effective reducing depressive symptoms. imagine that,
food-based compound can't make without, right, not situation
can make omega-3s. get food sources
supplementation, effective 20 milligrams fluoxetine course eight


weeks. really interesting addition combination
thousand milligrams EPA Fluoxetine synergistic effect lowering
depressive symptoms. find remarkable. heard first came
wasn't sure make it. 'Cause lot studies come
generally like focus changes behavior around things large
center mass. lot information. couple years later, fact start taking
thousand milligrams per day EPA fish oil. Now side effects fish
oil. People blood, bleeders Factor V Leiden mutations
women taking birth control, can affect blood clotting things
sort really talk doctor make sure okay you. Fish oil also can give
people fishy breath pretty gross, frankly, now fish oils either
Encapsulations put lemon flavoring
doesn't effect. event, thousand milligrams per day EPA. started
ingesting regularly. just felt better. wasn't clinically depressed, generally,
feel least me, increase mood affect. number things
supposed reduce inflammation. cardiovascular effects controversial long
time everyone thought effects platelets really terrific.
articles came major newspapers saying maybe not much effects
mood really profound. now lots studies.

01:01:00 Fish Oil Antidepressant

go PubMed put EPA fish oil depression find
number really impressive results showing least
effective certain SSRI antidepressants dosages can amplify improve
effect low dosages SSRIs. feel like people
know this. nutrition, profoundly affecting mood depression
terrible, right? Depression can component anxiety cases
people feel lousy uncertain. kind talk depression
anxiety talk someone anxious can tell everything's
gonna okay. always concerned might not know.
don't really know plane isn't gonna crash. don't really know life gonna go
okay. sense, right, no one crystal ball can predict
future, tend perseverate fixate uncertainty. course


versions depression involve certainty. People lethargic
certain say, yeah, certain, never gonna get another job. certain,
never gonna meet anyone new. certain gonna fail. kind divide
sphere depression around certainty uncertainty. interesting
thousand milligrams per day EPA shown relieve forms
depression. Now, mean gonna work everybody? No, not
try play psychiatrist. want point direction manuscripts
can make informed choices yourself. can discuss doctor
family make choices right you. especially
interesting heart effects, heard omega-3s,

01:02:40 EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain

course can get sources too, can get fatty fish,
flax seeds, hemp seeds. number chia seeds, kinds things
levels EPA required quite high. thousand milligrams per day
pretty hard get food although can done depending
eating. interesting heart effects solid really stand
literature lot something talked previous episode.
mention again, heart rate variability. know heart rate
really high heart rate, really low. Neither good. lot people
think, oh just want low heart rate, big stroke volume. know, running
lot may 30 40 beats per minute. great shape still want
heart rate variability. lot tone autonomic nervous system
talked last time. How, inhale, speeds heart rate. exhale,
decreases heart rate. called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. basis
heart rate variability. maybe short post this. can get
mechanism behaviors spill might useful you.
point heart rate variability. HRV good. interesting
study 2009 showed people eat diet fail supplement
way high omega-6 three ratio, not enough omega-3s, not
markers inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 TNF-alpha,
tend non-responders antidepressants. Shifting omega-3 omega-6 ratio
couple things. First all, increasing amount EPA shifted ratio.


higher omega-3 omega-6 ratio, good, lowered inflammation markers,
allowed antidepressants effect, even low doses.
really interesting thing. worked increasing heart rate variability, think, well,
world happen? know mean, ton effects
way works way things impacting gut
autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, said, vagus includes connections
heart signaling sensory information fast heart beating
brain not just stuff lungs, information heart brain
adjusts heart rate heart rate variability. incredible way one
can use gut, ingestion EPA's, either food
supplementation increase rate variability thereby improve symptoms, meaning
reduce symptoms depression, even make low levels antidepressants
wouldn't otherwise work work. think like study much a, super
cool. bridges brain body access. incorporates nutrition micronutrients
brain also really points something hear time,
body whole system. working whole system brain isn't working
isolation skull. reacting things happening body
gut heart rate heart rate variability. things ingest can
profound effect them. Now, course, really want emphasize something
no one compound nutrient supplement drug behavior
matter going end shifting depression improving one's
mood improving sleep. constellation things. especially true
people start get excited supplements drugs kinds potential
various things. Right now, lot excitement psychedelics
therapeutic uses. think great, good friend mine physician
clinician says better living chemistry still requires better living. cannot

01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either
food supplementation. acknowledge not everyone wants take fish oil.
couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment
makes not want ingest fish related products. krill oil. Krill still
organism. little tiny thing whales eat lot people generally eat little
of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.
preference. people really like krill oil source omega-3s. mention
sources like chia seeds flax seeds, notice
not things tend ingest lot regular basis. possible get omega-3s
meats. animals grazed grasses contain lot omega-3s.
ingest meat source meat gonna important
relates omega-3s. Even within category fish oil concern
sometimes mercury contaminants. want go brand
emphasizes gone really good sources decontaminate
regardless. search brands. test can


01:09:05 L-Carnitine Mood, Sperm Ovary Quality, Autism, Fibromyalgia,
Migraine

whether not fish oil rancid not. people take liquid form.
people take capsule form. liquid form gonna affordable. capsule
form little easier little portable. can actually just chew one
gel tablets. tastes really fishy kind rancid, know disgusting.
want spit out. doesn't tolerable know okay.
Unfortunately buy first order that. Although, don't know, maybe
can get open bottle store tell want try


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall
around brain barrier brain important.
feature neurons don't recreate injury, like
organs body. not lot turnover cells despite might've
heard. nature created BBB, blood brain barrier make sure
certain molecules particular, large molecules don't get across blood-brain barrier.
'Cause can damaging tissues. Incidentally, also rigid

testes ovaries, going blood gonadal barrier. barriers
exist make just eat something, just ingest
doesn't mean going cross blood-brain barrier, L-carnitine taken
acetylated converted form gets across blood-brain barrier.
lot effects, involved mitochondrial activation long chain fatty acids
big mouthful, get time talking metabolic,

three studies listed there. Again, not promoting this, people
take L-carnitine, especially trying get pregnant check
effects studies mentioned published peer reviewed rigorous
journals. terms neural effects. quite interesting. effects
depression still emerging seem exist people feel notable
decrease depressive symptoms. seven studies listed examine.com
notable benefit variety circumstances participants heightened
depression already. start taking L-carnitine start feeling better.
talk dosages various studies. also shown notable
decrease symptoms autism, find fascinating. Also again, things
ingest impact chemicals brain impact rest body.
things used treat certain forms alcohol dependence.
think going exciting emerging area. gonna whole month

emerging field people can take supplement help ease cravings
withdrawal trying quit drugs abuse, like cocaine, alcohol, heroin,
smoking things sort. really interesting area. is, like think
early days gonna discover lot more. huge list things here. Since
talked pain previous episode know lot people written
fibromyalgia. L carnitine shown reduce symptoms
fibromyalgia. Again, links studies examine.com, totally free site.

decided wanted leave go get drink water. please forgive noise.
Okay. now turn another aspect gut-brain relationship will surprise
you, cases might shock you. really cool actionable
biology. gut microbiome, probiotics prebiotics. know today
talking emotions not pain remiss didn't mention another effect


acetylcarnitine reported can find listed link study

oftentimes hear gut brain axis days, discussion
gut microbiome. again, situation incredible biology,
happy much discussion gut microbiome. somewhat
dismayed concerned hear either false partially
false. gonna clear misconceptions, first understanding

just talk general rules thumb related research quality research
peer reviewed. future episode

01:21:55 Probiotics, Brain Fog, Autism, Fermentation

will go far deeper gut microbiome gut brain axis. things
think might find surprising. First all, supporting healthy gut microbiome
good mood, great digestion great immune system function. However,
not mean maxing taking probiotic prebiotic can
possibly manage. mentioned many times believe probiotics, take
probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case
better. things like brain fog can come that, brain fog just
inability focus. People feel really not well generally. studies
little bit controversial think fair say people really increase amount
probiotic taking beyond certain amount start feeling foggy
mind. Now much? Well get probiotics mentioned Athletic
Greens, can get fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,
different sources around world. Actually, love hear
sources people know foods around world. fascinated
way different cultures arrived foods provide support
healthy microbiomes fermented. colleague Stanford, Justin
Sonnenberg, talked this. don't want quote
inappropriately, discussions it, published
ingestion fermented foods one best ways support healthy levels gut
microbiota without exceeding threshold cause things like brain fog.
foods fermented foods going best source. number
different ways one that. people don't like fermented foods, however
people supplement it. isn't case better. know that.
true healthy gut microbiota shown improve symptoms
certain psychiatric illnesses well certain conditions like particular features along

dopamine. gut microbiome provides kind foundation healthy gut
healthy gut brain access much people report start eating
small bits 'cause doesn't require lot fermented foods, overall mood
better, not unlike effects EPA. Although don't think looked directly

comments. terrific. things can really
damage gut microbiome. huge misconception want
clear up. study published "Nature", among three
top journals science. know, "Nature", "Science"

01:25:20 Artificial Sweeteners & Gut Microbiome: NOT Bad; Depends!

"Cell" considered top tops, excellent journal showed artificial

things not mentioned really important. study
saccharin particular. Saccharin not typical artificial sweetener used,
typical artificial sweeteners used things like aspartame, so-called
NutraSweet Sucralose, days Stevia, monk fruits, knowledge
please correct anyone knows studies, knowledge, negative

Now enough chemical similarity saccharin ones
mentioned, not them. instance, Stevia, monk fruit distinct
chemical makeup probably don't any, lower effects,
negative effects gut microbiome, still tested. saccharin
really, shown study several studies can really negatively impact
quality gut microbiome. Interestingly, narrative around artificial sweeteners
gut microbiome incorrect. people thought, oh, saccharin bad

01:28:00 Ketogenic, Vegan, & Processed Food Effects, Individual Differences

willing go there. 'Cause think deserves conversation, nowadays
many examples people switched kind standard

necessarily mean ingestion meats, can. experience
positive effects themselves. Not everybody. talked previously
kind incorrect, believe incorrect marketing keto relates

people love keto works great them. ketogenic diet interesting
one shifts ketogenic diet shift gut microbiome.
people end feeling better. people end feeling worse. Likewise,
people go ingesting animal products including meat vegetarian
go vegan experience positive shifts mood affect. know
transition plant-based diet especially enrichment fiber
present diets also creates dramatic shifts gut microbiome. people
feel better that. people feel worse. course, gonna depend
whether not ingesting lot processed foods not. paper

advice. note fasting. colleague Yale, expert

01:33:20 Fasting-Based Depletion Microbiome

gut microbiome. told something really interesting,
fast, actually digest certain components within dietary tract. actually depletes
good amount gut microbiome. interesting. good results
guess call intermittent kind circadian type fasting never
done long fast, push first meal hours first meal
generally around lunchtime longer periods fasting go day
two three days known deplete gut microbiome major ways. not
always necessarily bad thing replenished, often replenished
levels exceeded previous level. think GI tract even
mental effects returning eating feeding sometimes people don't
feel good start eating. really want food, start eating
again. don't feel good fast. may related
depletion microbiome occurs long fast. again, something
think talk doctor, idea fasting across board
good. may merits that, certainly cases,
deplete microbiome depletion microbiome significant
means return eating, actually not position digest
assimilate foods. foods not position impact
brain body way prior fast. is, think people
suggest kind gradual transition back consuming nutrients fast.
round up, want share results without question will impact
way respond food mentally even physically. know
central theme studies tell about.

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues
experiment took housekeepers, essentially hotel workers,


divide two groups. watch short film. one case, film
work important help people feel comfortable hotel, et
cetera, et cetera. group heard activity

01:38:30 Mindset Controls Metabolism

cleaning taking care hotel good them. good
health, et cetera, et cetera. controlled nicely study health
parameters, individual differences. behaviors people
period followed short tutorial. found eight weeks later,
group told activity good showed lower blood
pressure. lost significant amount body fat reported enjoying
work far group. work, simply biased mentally
information given, physiology followed information.
not just placebo effect. incredible set findings illustrate
extent whether not believe food gonna good us not good
us. Well, can't escape reality. can't tell poison gonna
good ingest poison expect not kill you, can tell
eating 12 croissants, confess done it, long run, long time
ago can't tell necessarily going good
gonna make lose weight. belief effects not lying
cases, experiments notice subjects didn't prior knowledge
grehlin effects daily routine weight loss blood
pressure. order work naive information, right?
can't simply lie tell want believe
important, also important mind body fascinating
interplay. today talked mainly body things put
inside tube, runs mouth end rectum, basically
impacting cells, neurons, microbiota mucosal lining, heart, lungs
information feeding brain impact feel here.
also feel impacting body reacts levels core
physiology couldn't just tell gonna work,
believe certain substances, certain foods, certain nutrients profound
effect magnitude impact

surface. Amazing, bean serotonin surface indeed serotonin
put skin cause irritation skin, amazing. Inside
bean L-DOPA, Mucuna pruriens not just something promotes dopamine
release weird mystical ancient thing whatever, sorcery.
chemically L-DOPA precursor dopamine. contains molecules well
low levels psychoactives. stuff available counter. Incredible.
personally find incredible. effects really interesting. not gonna read
off mentioned effects not encouraging take
get window dopamine, acute dopamine increase non-
Parkinsonian context. can start think foods rich L-tyrosine
biasing certain effects not others. hear food medicine, food isn't really
medicine. Food food, food chemical effects well. first one listed
three studies high rigor overall minor effect things, sperm
quality. appears sperm motility itself, assuming say sperm
quality don't know features sperm quality looked sperm,
not discussion want have, assuming motility know enough
reproductive biology know sperm ability swim depends proteins
present front sperm, et cetera things like contractions sperm
motility generally associated sperm quality. Sperm don't move generally
not useful sperm. Symptoms Parkinson disease notably degraded
Mucuna pruriens. fascinating. not surprising. lot
effects here. Feelings subjective wellbeing, testosterone, reductions prolactin, not
surprising. Prolactin hormone involved milk letdown, lactating mothers.
involved feelings peace generally antagonistic sexual desire
men female. really interesting things like Mucuna pruriens L-
DOPA reduce prolactin, increased sperm motility, increased testosterone, subjective
wellbeing. starting see theme, right? Dopamine really makes us
motivated. Feel pursuit, makes us feel good. Serotonin makes us feel relaxed
calm. Now whole month emotion. might thinking, well, wait

00:51:00 Emotional Context Book Recommendation: “How Emotions Made”

going relates emotions. last episode said
something gonna repeat now briefly, much talk


good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman
Podcast. discussions Instagram Live, Northeastern
University, world expert emotions. first book "How Emotions Made"
not book sent me. paid money years ago, bought it, read
it, loved long met Lisa, just delighted got known
little bit. really interesting read psychology emotions
subjectivity emotions. So, whereas talking mainly biology emotions
gets little bit psychology biology well. Lisa's just
terrific. also putting lot information world emotion.
want learn check work, again, Lisa Feldman Barrett.
book "How Emotions Made" Hopefully continue write many
books. now understand relationship hope foods dopamine,
foods serotonin communicated brain via
vagus, right? ingest foods, supplements things people take,
don't put directly brain. put gut. yes, gut
brain connection not serotonin gut makes feel calm
placid. not dopamine gut. just oversold way
think something really attractive. understand idea
certain things experience life emotions happening body.
maybe little control, right? thing hard container.
can't just stuff dopamine there. probably take Mucuna pruriens
bean stuff ear, please don't that. It'd make ear itchy
serotonin outside. can't get stuff there. ingest
things metabolized certain ways communicate brain maybe
pass brain across called blood brain barrier. talk
blood brain barrier minute. actually called BBB. ends


sounding like baby, BBB. guess like BB, anyway, BBB, also nerves
gut sensing nutrient contents food saying, oh,
feel better want more. Oh, got lot bitterness acid taste it.
want less that. transitioned discussion dopamine
serotonin gut hopefully got actionable items belt,
pun intended, can understand certain foods certain nutrients
can look up, might impact mood. somebody really anxious
really wired. Well, dopamine adrenaline pathway epinephrine pathway
probably not one want lean harder. tend someone
pretty passive trouble motivation. Well think ramping
dopamine pathway through, always think behaviors proper food choices
best way start. behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.

00:54:55 Exercise: Powerful Mood Enhancer, Lacks Specificity

one problems discussion around mood exercise mood
meditation subjective. like, love certain forms exercise not
others. Certain ones aversive me. Certain ones attractive me, never
really clear. No one's ever told me. Okay, 10 minutes bike X
number RPM so-and-so skier order get dopamine up.
can actually say, ingest L-tyrosine high probability going
make dopamine. talking ingesting food
supplementation like. Mucuna pruriens, tried. just mention
dopaminergic me. got really, really jazzed severe crash
next day. that's, think tend ride pretty high kind alertness
motivation scale. always told Costello people podcast
studio slow speech down. uncaffeinated, probably afford
little serotonin life. So, whereas Costello, can afford wake every
couple days just say hello us. dog sleeps creature.
remarkable. things can actionable.
ways quantitative can regulate dosages can
regulate amounts can regulate timing. everyone play
things figure right terms feeding. everyone
explore understand safe right them. But, course, exercise


still important. talked social connection last episode super important
activation serotonin comes gut brain, body brain relationship,
eat really matters terms neurochemicals make.

00:56:45 Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil Alleviating Depression

talk little bit things ingest body allow
body inform brain shift mood. something
years. just want say found complete game changer.
excellent science support it. think people familiar different
context don't think people know simple fact omega-3
omega-6 fatty acid ratio profound effect depression. profound effect
mood much double-blind placebo controlled study will provide
link too, study first published 2008 there've many others well.
First all, experiment done animals. found model learned
helplessness animals. not kind animals, put rats mice
jar. let swim swim, swim, swim try save life.
eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially
done humans although didn't swim point near drowning.
took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,
appetite, sorts negative health effects. comparison thousand
milligrams day EPA. EPA one elements contains high levels
omega-3's things like fish oil, talk sources little bit
wasn't thousand milligrams fish oil. thousand milligrams EPA. Compared
20 milligrams Fluoxetine Prozac, okay. Really increases serotonin.
study 60 individuals, again, provide links study. found
equally effective reducing depressive symptoms. imagine that,
food-based compound can't make without, right, not situation
can make omega-3s. get food sources
supplementation, effective 20 milligrams fluoxetine course eight


weeks. really interesting addition combination
thousand milligrams EPA Fluoxetine synergistic effect lowering
depressive symptoms. find remarkable. heard first came
wasn't sure make it. 'Cause lot studies come
generally like focus changes behavior around things large
center mass. lot information. couple years later, fact start taking
thousand milligrams per day EPA fish oil. Now side effects fish
oil. People blood, bleeders Factor V Leiden mutations
women taking birth control, can affect blood clotting things
sort really talk doctor make sure okay you. Fish oil also can give
people fishy breath pretty gross, frankly, now fish oils either
Encapsulations put lemon flavoring
doesn't effect. event, thousand milligrams per day EPA. started
ingesting regularly. just felt better. wasn't clinically depressed, generally,
feel least me, increase mood affect. number things
supposed reduce inflammation. cardiovascular effects controversial long
time everyone thought effects platelets really terrific.
articles came major newspapers saying maybe not much effects
mood really profound. now lots studies.

01:01:00 Fish Oil Antidepressant

go PubMed put EPA fish oil depression find
number really impressive results showing least
effective certain SSRI antidepressants dosages can amplify improve
effect low dosages SSRIs. feel like people
know this. nutrition, profoundly affecting mood depression
terrible, right? Depression can component anxiety cases
people feel lousy uncertain. kind talk depression
anxiety talk someone anxious can tell everything's
gonna okay. always concerned might not know.
don't really know plane isn't gonna crash. don't really know life gonna go
okay. sense, right, no one crystal ball can predict
future, tend perseverate fixate uncertainty. course


versions depression involve certainty. People lethargic
certain say, yeah, certain, never gonna get another job. certain,
never gonna meet anyone new. certain gonna fail. kind divide
sphere depression around certainty uncertainty. interesting
thousand milligrams per day EPA shown relieve forms
depression. Now, mean gonna work everybody? No, not
try play psychiatrist. want point direction manuscripts
can make informed choices yourself. can discuss doctor
family make choices right you. especially
interesting heart effects, heard omega-3s,

01:02:40 EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain

course can get sources too, can get fatty fish,
flax seeds, hemp seeds. number chia seeds, kinds things
levels EPA required quite high. thousand milligrams per day
pretty hard get food although can done depending
eating. interesting heart effects solid really stand
literature lot something talked previous episode.
mention again, heart rate variability. know heart rate
really high heart rate, really low. Neither good. lot people
think, oh just want low heart rate, big stroke volume. know, running
lot may 30 40 beats per minute. great shape still want
heart rate variability. lot tone autonomic nervous system
talked last time. How, inhale, speeds heart rate. exhale,
decreases heart rate. called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. basis
heart rate variability. maybe short post this. can get
mechanism behaviors spill might useful you.
point heart rate variability. HRV good. interesting
study 2009 showed people eat diet fail supplement
way high omega-6 three ratio, not enough omega-3s, not
markers inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 TNF-alpha,
tend non-responders antidepressants. Shifting omega-3 omega-6 ratio
couple things. First all, increasing amount EPA shifted ratio.


higher omega-3 omega-6 ratio, good, lowered inflammation markers,
allowed antidepressants effect, even low doses.
really interesting thing. worked increasing heart rate variability, think, well,
world happen? know mean, ton effects
way works way things impacting gut
autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, said, vagus includes connections
heart signaling sensory information fast heart beating
brain not just stuff lungs, information heart brain
adjusts heart rate heart rate variability. incredible way one
can use gut, ingestion EPA's, either food
supplementation increase rate variability thereby improve symptoms, meaning
reduce symptoms depression, even make low levels antidepressants
wouldn't otherwise work work. think like study much a, super
cool. bridges brain body access. incorporates nutrition micronutrients
brain also really points something hear time,
body whole system. working whole system brain isn't working
isolation skull. reacting things happening body
gut heart rate heart rate variability. things ingest can
profound effect them. Now, course, really want emphasize something
no one compound nutrient supplement drug behavior
matter going end shifting depression improving one's
mood improving sleep. constellation things. especially true
people start get excited supplements drugs kinds potential
various things. Right now, lot excitement psychedelics
therapeutic uses. think great, good friend mine physician
clinician says better living chemistry still requires better living. cannot
expect take compound regardless source potency completely shift

01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either
food supplementation. acknowledge not everyone wants take fish oil.
couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment
makes not want ingest fish related products. krill oil. Krill still
organism. little tiny thing whales eat lot people generally eat little
of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.
preference. people really like krill oil source omega-3s. mention
sources like chia seeds flax seeds, notice
not things tend ingest lot regular basis. possible get omega-3s
meats. animals grazed grasses contain lot omega-3s.
ingest meat source meat gonna important
relates omega-3s. Even within category fish oil concern
sometimes mercury contaminants. want go brand
emphasizes gone really good sources decontaminate
regardless. search brands. test can


01:09:05 L-Carnitine Mood, Sperm Ovary Quality, Autism, Fibromyalgia,
Migraine

whether not fish oil rancid not. people take liquid form.
people take capsule form. liquid form gonna affordable. capsule
form little easier little portable. can actually just chew one
gel tablets. tastes really fishy kind rancid, know disgusting.
want spit out. doesn't tolerable know okay.
Unfortunately buy first order that. Although, don't know, maybe
can get open bottle store tell want try


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall
around brain barrier brain important.
feature neurons don't recreate injury, like
organs body. not lot turnover cells despite might've
heard. nature created BBB, blood brain barrier make sure
certain molecules particular, large molecules don't get across blood-brain barrier.
'Cause can damaging tissues. Incidentally, also rigid
stringent barrier around organs, gonads. ovaries
testes brain organs body nature gone way
protect, give additional layer blood-brain barrier might imagine
testes ovaries, going blood gonadal barrier. barriers
exist make just eat something, just ingest
doesn't mean going cross blood-brain barrier, L-carnitine taken
acetylated converted form gets across blood-brain barrier.
lot effects, involved mitochondrial activation long chain fatty acids
big mouthful, get time talking metabolic,
interesting effects neuro side. decide check
examine.com see really interesting things, lots effects ammonia, C-


reactive proteins, things sort, blood glucose lowered, et cetera. stuff
level blood periphery, slight effects lowering cholesterol.
interesting ones. Rates pregnancy go way people taking L-carnitine
father mother source sperm source egg affected
ways favors pregnancy. increase, go sperm quality
sperm motility males seems positive effects females
polycystic ovary syndrome. check out. know, effects strong.
three studies listed there. Again, not promoting this, people
take L-carnitine, especially trying get pregnant check
effects studies mentioned published peer reviewed rigorous
journals. terms neural effects. quite interesting. effects
depression still emerging seem exist people feel notable
decrease depressive symptoms. seven studies listed examine.com
notable benefit variety circumstances participants heightened
depression already. start taking L-carnitine start feeling better.
talk dosages various studies. also shown notable
decrease symptoms autism, find fascinating. Also again, things
ingest impact chemicals brain impact rest body.
things used treat certain forms alcohol dependence.
think going exciting emerging area. gonna whole month
addiction. got great guest lined month, now
emerging field people can take supplement help ease cravings
withdrawal trying quit drugs abuse, like cocaine, alcohol, heroin,
smoking things sort. really interesting area. is, like think
early days gonna discover lot more. huge list things here. Since
talked pain previous episode know lot people written
fibromyalgia. L carnitine shown reduce symptoms
fibromyalgia. Again, links studies examine.com, totally free site.
bulldog battering ram. nothing graceful bulldog.
decided wanted leave go get drink water. please forgive noise.
Okay. now turn another aspect gut-brain relationship will surprise
you, cases might shock you. really cool actionable
biology. gut microbiome, probiotics prebiotics. know today
talking emotions not pain remiss didn't mention another effect


acetylcarnitine reported can find listed link study
examine.com effect reducing symptoms migraine.
randomized controlled trial 133 participants frequent migraines.
taking 500 milligrams L-carnitine nothing 12 weeks. control little bit,
control experiment little bit tricky significant effect reducing
number migraine attacks per month. find really interesting
lot listed study. think compounds powerful.
carry risks certain people, not others. again, find right


01:16:29 Gut-Microbiome: Myths, Truths & Tubes Within Us

think super interesting potential therapeutics various people.
deal gut microbiome gut brain axis. Today actually
talking lot already gut brain axis nothing
microbiomes. talking vagus nerve connects providing
sensory information body brain. brain also sends
nerve motor information control motility got heart rate fast
breathe deployment immune stuff killer cells things sort.
oftentimes hear gut brain axis days, discussion
gut microbiome. again, situation incredible biology,
happy much discussion gut microbiome. somewhat
dismayed concerned hear either false partially
false. gonna clear misconceptions, first understanding

mainly changing conditions gut environment. addition
that, impact neurotransmitters neurons live gut.

just talk general rules thumb related research quality research
peer reviewed. future episode

01:21:55 Probiotics, Brain Fog, Autism, Fermentation

will go far deeper gut microbiome gut brain axis. things
think might find surprising. First all, supporting healthy gut microbiome
good mood, great digestion great immune system function. However,
not mean maxing taking probiotic prebiotic can
possibly manage. mentioned many times believe probiotics, take
probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case
better. things like brain fog can come that, brain fog just
inability focus. People feel really not well generally. studies
little bit controversial think fair say people really increase amount
probiotic taking beyond certain amount start feeling foggy
mind. Now much? Well get probiotics mentioned Athletic
Greens, can get fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,
different sources around world. Actually, love hear
sources people know foods around world. fascinated
way different cultures arrived foods provide support
healthy microbiomes fermented. colleague Stanford, Justin
Sonnenberg, talked this. don't want quote
inappropriately, discussions it, published
ingestion fermented foods one best ways support healthy levels gut
microbiota without exceeding threshold cause things like brain fog.
foods fermented foods going best source. number
different ways one that. people don't like fermented foods, however
people supplement it. isn't case better. know that.
true healthy gut microbiota shown improve symptoms
certain psychiatric illnesses well certain conditions like particular features along
autism spectrum, interesting. effects probably due not just
improvement immune system function, conditions neurons
sense nutrients convey information brain increase levels serotonin


dopamine. gut microbiome provides kind foundation healthy gut
healthy gut brain access much people report start eating
small bits 'cause doesn't require lot fermented foods, overall mood
better, not unlike effects EPA. Although don't think looked directly
context clinical depression yet. someone knows study please mention
comments. terrific. things can really
damage gut microbiome. huge misconception want
clear up. study published "Nature", among three
top journals science. know, "Nature", "Science"

01:25:20 Artificial Sweeteners & Gut Microbiome: NOT Bad; Depends!

"Cell" considered top tops, excellent journal showed artificial
sweeteners particular artificial sweetener saccharin can disrupt gut
microbiome ways detrimental number different health markers,
increasing inflammatory cytokines bad things happen gut
microbiome thrown off kilter. study widely discussed
things not mentioned really important. study
saccharin particular. Saccharin not typical artificial sweetener used,
typical artificial sweeteners used things like aspartame, so-called
NutraSweet Sucralose, days Stevia, monk fruits, knowledge
please correct anyone knows studies, knowledge, negative
effects artificial sweeteners gut microbiome restricted saccharin.
Now enough chemical similarity saccharin ones
mentioned, not them. instance, Stevia, monk fruit distinct
chemical makeup probably don't any, lower effects,
negative effects gut microbiome, still tested. saccharin
really, shown study several studies can really negatively impact
quality gut microbiome. Interestingly, narrative around artificial sweeteners
gut microbiome incorrect. people thought, oh, saccharin bad
microbiome. must kill microbiome. hear people saying, oh, artificial

thing people say, oh, know, kills microbiome. doesn't kill
microbiome. shifts microbiome shifts microbiome can good
can bad. takes us another topic bit hot button topic

01:28:00 Ketogenic, Vegan, & Processed Food Effects, Individual Differences

willing go there. 'Cause think deserves conversation, nowadays
many examples people switched kind standard
diet even vegetarian diet vegan diet, keto diet. Now keto doesn't
necessarily mean ingestion meats, can. experience
positive effects themselves. Not everybody. talked previously
kind incorrect, believe incorrect marketing keto relates
cosmetic effects challenges sleep people
people love keto works great them. ketogenic diet interesting
one shifts ketogenic diet shift gut microbiome.
people end feeling better. people end feeling worse. Likewise,
people go ingesting animal products including meat vegetarian
go vegan experience positive shifts mood affect. know
transition plant-based diet especially enrichment fiber
present diets also creates dramatic shifts gut microbiome. people
feel better that. people feel worse. course, gonna depend
whether not ingesting lot processed foods not. paper
published "Cell", "Cell Press" journal obviously, excellent journal, showing
ingestion processed foods, regardless whether not come animal
sources non-animal sources processed foods tend create activity
within body surely roots nervous system lead over-
consumption calories weight gain. Even weight gain couldn't
explained increased calories. words, processed foods bad, regardless
whether not talking animal products non animal products, probably not
surprising given know sugar sensing amino acid sensing

advice. note fasting. colleague Yale, expert

01:33:20 Fasting-Based Depletion Microbiome

gut microbiome. told something really interesting,
fast, actually digest certain components within dietary tract. actually depletes
good amount gut microbiome. interesting. good results
guess call intermittent kind circadian type fasting never
done long fast, push first meal hours first meal
generally around lunchtime longer periods fasting go day
two three days known deplete gut microbiome major ways. not
always necessarily bad thing replenished, often replenished
levels exceeded previous level. think GI tract even
mental effects returning eating feeding sometimes people don't
feel good start eating. really want food, start eating
again. don't feel good fast. may related
depletion microbiome occurs long fast. again, something
think talk doctor, idea fasting across board
good. may merits that, certainly cases,
deplete microbiome depletion microbiome significant
means return eating, actually not position digest
assimilate foods. foods not position impact
brain body way prior fast. is, think people
suggest kind gradual transition back consuming nutrients fast.
round up, want share results without question will impact
way respond food mentally even physically. know
central theme studies tell about.

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues
experiment took housekeepers, essentially hotel workers,


divide two groups. watch short film. one case, film
work important help people feel comfortable hotel, et
cetera, et cetera. group heard activity

01:38:30 Mindset Controls Metabolism

cleaning taking care hotel good them. good
health, et cetera, et cetera. controlled nicely study health
parameters, individual differences. behaviors people
period followed short tutorial. found eight weeks later,
group told activity good showed lower blood
pressure. lost significant amount body fat reported enjoying
work far group. work, simply biased mentally
information given, physiology followed information.
not just placebo effect. incredible set findings illustrate
extent whether not believe food gonna good us not good
us. Well, can't escape reality. can't tell poison gonna
good ingest poison expect not kill you, can tell
eating 12 croissants, confess done it, long run, long time
ago can't tell necessarily going good
gonna make lose weight. belief effects not lying
cases, experiments notice subjects didn't prior knowledge
grehlin effects daily routine weight loss blood
pressure. order work naive information, right?
can't simply lie tell want believe
important, also important mind body fascinating
interplay. today talked mainly body things put
inside tube, runs mouth end rectum, basically
impacting cells, neurons, microbiota mucosal lining, heart, lungs
information feeding brain impact feel here.
also feel impacting body reacts levels core
physiology couldn't just tell gonna work,
believe certain substances, certain foods, certain nutrients profound
effect magnitude impact

good emotions bad emotions. context that. social context.
can't really say emotion good bad. Grieving funeral healthy. happy
funeral, assuming loved person died people probably wouldn't
think healthy. can't really say certain emotions like sadness
happiness healthy. context important. Cultural context important. Many
asked book recommendations. opportunity raise mention
another book. Again, don't financial affiliation anything want
read emotions context cultural things impact emotions
huge fan Lisa Feldman Barrett. learned Lex Fridman
Podcast. discussions Instagram Live, Northeastern
University, world expert emotions. first book "How Emotions Made"
not book sent me. paid money years ago, bought it, read
it, loved long met Lisa, just delighted got known
little bit. really interesting read psychology emotions
subjectivity emotions. So, whereas talking mainly biology emotions
gets little bit psychology biology well. Lisa's just
terrific. also putting lot information world emotion.
want learn check work, again, Lisa Feldman Barrett.
book "How Emotions Made" Hopefully continue write many
books. now understand relationship hope foods dopamine,
foods serotonin communicated brain via
vagus, right? ingest foods, supplements things people take,
don't put directly brain. put gut. yes, gut
brain connection not serotonin gut makes feel calm
placid. not dopamine gut. just oversold way
think something really attractive. understand idea
certain things experience life emotions happening body.
maybe little control, right? thing hard container.
can't just stuff dopamine there. probably take Mucuna pruriens
bean stuff ear, please don't that. It'd make ear itchy
serotonin outside. can't get stuff there. ingest
things metabolized certain ways communicate brain maybe
pass brain across called blood brain barrier. talk
blood brain barrier minute. actually called BBB. ends


sounding like baby, BBB. guess like BB, anyway, BBB, also nerves
gut sensing nutrient contents food saying, oh,
feel better want more. Oh, got lot bitterness acid taste it.
want less that. transitioned discussion dopamine
serotonin gut hopefully got actionable items belt,
pun intended, can understand certain foods certain nutrients
can look up, might impact mood. somebody really anxious
really wired. Well, dopamine adrenaline pathway epinephrine pathway
probably not one want lean harder. tend someone
pretty passive trouble motivation. Well think ramping
dopamine pathway through, always think behaviors proper food choices
best way start. behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.

00:54:55 Exercise: Powerful Mood Enhancer, Lacks Specificity

one problems discussion around mood exercise mood
meditation subjective. like, love certain forms exercise not
others. Certain ones aversive me. Certain ones attractive me, never
really clear. No one's ever told me. Okay, 10 minutes bike X
number RPM so-and-so skier order get dopamine up.
can actually say, ingest L-tyrosine high probability going
make dopamine. talking ingesting food
supplementation like. Mucuna pruriens, tried. just mention
dopaminergic me. got really, really jazzed severe crash
next day. that's, think tend ride pretty high kind alertness
motivation scale. always told Costello people podcast
studio slow speech down. uncaffeinated, probably afford
little serotonin life. So, whereas Costello, can afford wake every
couple days just say hello us. dog sleeps creature.
remarkable. things can actionable.
ways quantitative can regulate dosages can
regulate amounts can regulate timing. everyone play
things figure right terms feeding. everyone
explore understand safe right them. But, course, exercise


still important. talked social connection last episode super important
activation serotonin comes gut brain, body brain relationship,
eat really matters terms neurochemicals make.

00:56:45 Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil Alleviating Depression

talk little bit things ingest body allow
body inform brain shift mood. something
years. just want say found complete game changer.
excellent science support it. think people familiar different
context don't think people know simple fact omega-3
omega-6 fatty acid ratio profound effect depression. profound effect
mood much double-blind placebo controlled study will provide
link too, study first published 2008 there've many others well.
First all, experiment done animals. found model learned
helplessness animals. not kind animals, put rats mice
jar. let swim swim, swim, swim try save life.
eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially
done humans although didn't swim point near drowning.
took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,
appetite, sorts negative health effects. comparison thousand
milligrams day EPA. EPA one elements contains high levels
omega-3's things like fish oil, talk sources little bit
wasn't thousand milligrams fish oil. thousand milligrams EPA. Compared
20 milligrams Fluoxetine Prozac, okay. Really increases serotonin.
study 60 individuals, again, provide links study. found
equally effective reducing depressive symptoms. imagine that,
food-based compound can't make without, right, not situation
can make omega-3s. get food sources
supplementation, effective 20 milligrams fluoxetine course eight


weeks. really interesting addition combination
thousand milligrams EPA Fluoxetine synergistic effect lowering
depressive symptoms. find remarkable. heard first came
wasn't sure make it. 'Cause lot studies come
generally like focus changes behavior around things large
center mass. lot information. couple years later, fact start taking
thousand milligrams per day EPA fish oil. Now side effects fish
oil. People blood, bleeders Factor V Leiden mutations
women taking birth control, can affect blood clotting things
sort really talk doctor make sure okay you. Fish oil also can give
people fishy breath pretty gross, frankly, now fish oils either
Encapsulations put lemon flavoring
doesn't effect. event, thousand milligrams per day EPA. started
ingesting regularly. just felt better. wasn't clinically depressed, generally,
feel least me, increase mood affect. number things
supposed reduce inflammation. cardiovascular effects controversial long
time everyone thought effects platelets really terrific.
articles came major newspapers saying maybe not much effects
mood really profound. now lots studies.

01:01:00 Fish Oil Antidepressant

go PubMed put EPA fish oil depression find
number really impressive results showing least
effective certain SSRI antidepressants dosages can amplify improve
effect low dosages SSRIs. feel like people
know this. nutrition, profoundly affecting mood depression
terrible, right? Depression can component anxiety cases
people feel lousy uncertain. kind talk depression
anxiety talk someone anxious can tell everything's
gonna okay. always concerned might not know.
don't really know plane isn't gonna crash. don't really know life gonna go
okay. sense, right, no one crystal ball can predict
future, tend perseverate fixate uncertainty. course


versions depression involve certainty. People lethargic
certain say, yeah, certain, never gonna get another job. certain,
never gonna meet anyone new. certain gonna fail. kind divide
sphere depression around certainty uncertainty. interesting
thousand milligrams per day EPA shown relieve forms
depression. Now, mean gonna work everybody? No, not
try play psychiatrist. want point direction manuscripts
can make informed choices yourself. can discuss doctor
family make choices right you. especially
interesting heart effects, heard omega-3s,

01:02:40 EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain

course can get sources too, can get fatty fish,
flax seeds, hemp seeds. number chia seeds, kinds things
levels EPA required quite high. thousand milligrams per day
pretty hard get food although can done depending
eating. interesting heart effects solid really stand
literature lot something talked previous episode.
mention again, heart rate variability. know heart rate
really high heart rate, really low. Neither good. lot people
think, oh just want low heart rate, big stroke volume. know, running
lot may 30 40 beats per minute. great shape still want
heart rate variability. lot tone autonomic nervous system
talked last time. How, inhale, speeds heart rate. exhale,
decreases heart rate. called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. basis
heart rate variability. maybe short post this. can get
mechanism behaviors spill might useful you.
point heart rate variability. HRV good. interesting
study 2009 showed people eat diet fail supplement
way high omega-6 three ratio, not enough omega-3s, not
markers inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 TNF-alpha,
tend non-responders antidepressants. Shifting omega-3 omega-6 ratio
couple things. First all, increasing amount EPA shifted ratio.


higher omega-3 omega-6 ratio, good, lowered inflammation markers,
allowed antidepressants effect, even low doses.
really interesting thing. worked increasing heart rate variability, think, well,
world happen? know mean, ton effects
way works way things impacting gut
autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, said, vagus includes connections
heart signaling sensory information fast heart beating
brain not just stuff lungs, information heart brain
adjusts heart rate heart rate variability. incredible way one
can use gut, ingestion EPA's, either food
supplementation increase rate variability thereby improve symptoms, meaning
reduce symptoms depression, even make low levels antidepressants
wouldn't otherwise work work. think like study much a, super
cool. bridges brain body access. incorporates nutrition micronutrients
brain also really points something hear time,
body whole system. working whole system brain isn't working
isolation skull. reacting things happening body
gut heart rate heart rate variability. things ingest can
profound effect them. Now, course, really want emphasize something
no one compound nutrient supplement drug behavior
matter going end shifting depression improving one's
mood improving sleep. constellation things. especially true
people start get excited supplements drugs kinds potential
various things. Right now, lot excitement psychedelics
therapeutic uses. think great, good friend mine physician
clinician says better living chemistry still requires better living. cannot
expect take compound regardless source potency completely shift
experience life without continue engage proper behaviors,
things know proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.
many others well. still find collection studies omega-3
omega-6 ratios profoundly important much completely changed
way think food, foods eat, supplement. don't necessarily think
everybody really think incredible compounds
robust effects feelings wellbeing.



01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either
food supplementation. acknowledge not everyone wants take fish oil.
couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment
makes not want ingest fish related products. krill oil. Krill still
organism. little tiny thing whales eat lot people generally eat little
of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.
preference. people really like krill oil source omega-3s. mention
sources like chia seeds flax seeds, notice
not things tend ingest lot regular basis. possible get omega-3s
meats. animals grazed grasses contain lot omega-3s.
ingest meat source meat gonna important
relates omega-3s. Even within category fish oil concern
sometimes mercury contaminants. want go brand

form little easier little portable. can actually just chew one
gel tablets. tastes really fishy kind rancid, know disgusting.
want spit out. doesn't tolerable know okay.
Unfortunately buy first order that. Although, don't know, maybe
can get open bottle store tell want try


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall
around brain barrier brain important.
feature neurons don't recreate injury, like
organs body. not lot turnover cells despite might've
heard. nature created BBB, blood brain barrier make sure
certain molecules particular, large molecules don't get across blood-brain barrier.
'Cause can damaging tissues. Incidentally, also rigid
stringent barrier around organs, gonads. ovaries
testes brain organs body nature gone way
protect, give additional layer blood-brain barrier might imagine
testes ovaries, going blood gonadal barrier. barriers
exist make just eat something, just ingest
doesn't mean going cross blood-brain barrier, L-carnitine taken
acetylated converted form gets across blood-brain barrier.
lot effects, involved mitochondrial activation long chain fatty acids
big mouthful, get time talking metabolic,
interesting effects neuro side. decide check
examine.com see really interesting things, lots effects ammonia, C-


reactive proteins, things sort, blood glucose lowered, et cetera. stuff
level blood periphery, slight effects lowering cholesterol.
interesting ones. Rates pregnancy go way people taking L-carnitine
father mother source sperm source egg affected
ways favors pregnancy. increase, go sperm quality
sperm motility males seems positive effects females
polycystic ovary syndrome. check out. know, effects strong.
three studies listed there. Again, not promoting this, people
take L-carnitine, especially trying get pregnant check
effects studies mentioned published peer reviewed rigorous
journals. terms neural effects. quite interesting. effects
depression still emerging seem exist people feel notable
decrease depressive symptoms. seven studies listed examine.com
notable benefit variety circumstances participants heightened
depression already. start taking L-carnitine start feeling better.
talk dosages various studies. also shown notable
decrease symptoms autism, find fascinating. Also again, things
ingest impact chemicals brain impact rest body.
things used treat certain forms alcohol dependence.
think going exciting emerging area. gonna whole month
addiction. got great guest lined month, now
emerging field people can take supplement help ease cravings
withdrawal trying quit drugs abuse, like cocaine, alcohol, heroin,
smoking things sort. really interesting area. is, like think
early days gonna discover lot more. huge list things here. Since
talked pain previous episode know lot people written
fibromyalgia. L carnitine shown reduce symptoms
fibromyalgia. Again, links studies examine.com, totally free site.
bulldog battering ram. nothing graceful bulldog.
decided wanted leave go get drink water. please forgive noise.
Okay. now turn another aspect gut-brain relationship will surprise
you, cases might shock you. really cool actionable
biology. gut microbiome, probiotics prebiotics. know today
talking emotions not pain remiss didn't mention another effect


acetylcarnitine reported can find listed link study
examine.com effect reducing symptoms migraine.
randomized controlled trial 133 participants frequent migraines.
taking 500 milligrams L-carnitine nothing 12 weeks. control little bit,

carry risks certain people, not others. again, find right


01:16:29 Gut-Microbiome: Myths, Truths & Tubes Within Us

think super interesting potential therapeutics various people.
deal gut microbiome gut brain axis. Today actually
talking lot already gut brain axis nothing
microbiomes. talking vagus nerve connects providing

oftentimes hear gut brain axis days, discussion
gut microbiome. again, situation incredible biology,
happy much discussion gut microbiome. somewhat
dismayed concerned hear either false partially

01:21:55 Probiotics, Brain Fog, Autism, Fermentation

will go far deeper gut microbiome gut brain axis. things
think might find surprising. First all, supporting healthy gut microbiome
good mood, great digestion great immune system function. However,
not mean maxing taking probiotic prebiotic can
possibly manage. mentioned many times believe probiotics, take
probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case
better. things like brain fog can come that, brain fog just
inability focus. People feel really not well generally. studies
little bit controversial think fair say people really increase amount
probiotic taking beyond certain amount start feeling foggy
mind. Now much? Well get probiotics mentioned Athletic
Greens, can get fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,
different sources around world. Actually, love hear
sources people know foods around world. fascinated
way different cultures arrived foods provide support
healthy microbiomes fermented. colleague Stanford, Justin

dopamine. gut microbiome provides kind foundation healthy gut
healthy gut brain access much people report start eating
small bits 'cause doesn't require lot fermented foods, overall mood
better, not unlike effects EPA. Although don't think looked directly

comments. terrific. things can really
damage gut microbiome. huge misconception want
clear up. study published "Nature", among three
top journals science. know, "Nature", "Science"

01:25:20 Artificial Sweeteners & Gut Microbiome: NOT Bad; Depends!

"Cell" considered top tops, excellent journal showed artificial

Now enough chemical similarity saccharin ones
mentioned, not them. instance, Stevia, monk fruit distinct
chemical makeup probably don't any, lower effects,
negative effects gut microbiome, still tested. saccharin
really, shown study several studies can really negatively impact
quality gut microbiome. Interestingly, narrative around artificial sweeteners
gut microbiome incorrect. people thought, oh, saccharin bad

01:28:00 Ketogenic, Vegan, & Processed Food Effects, Individual Differences

willing go there. 'Cause think deserves conversation, nowadays
many examples people switched kind standard

advice. note fasting. colleague Yale, expert

01:33:20 Fasting-Based Depletion Microbiome

gut microbiome. told something really interesting,
fast, actually digest certain components within dietary tract. actually depletes
good amount gut microbiome. interesting. good results
guess call intermittent kind circadian type fasting never
done long fast, push first meal hours first meal
generally around lunchtime longer periods fasting go day
two three days known deplete gut microbiome major ways. not
always necessarily bad thing replenished, often replenished

mental effects returning eating feeding sometimes people don't
feel good start eating. really want food, start eating
again. don't feel good fast. may related
depletion microbiome occurs long fast. again, something
think talk doctor, idea fasting across board
good. may merits that, certainly cases,
deplete microbiome depletion microbiome significant
means return eating, actually not position digest
assimilate foods. foods not position impact
brain body way prior fast. is, think people
suggest kind gradual transition back consuming nutrients fast.
round up, want share results without question will impact
way respond food mentally even physically. know
central theme studies tell about.

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues
experiment took housekeepers, essentially hotel workers,


divide two groups. watch short film. one case, film
work important help people feel comfortable hotel, et
cetera, et cetera. group heard activity

01:38:30 Mindset Controls Metabolism

period followed short tutorial. found eight weeks later,
group told activity good showed lower blood
pressure. lost significant amount body fat reported enjoying
work far group. work, simply biased mentally
information given, physiology followed information.
not just placebo effect. incredible set findings illustrate
extent whether not believe food gonna good us not good
us. Well, can't escape reality. can't tell poison gonna
good ingest poison expect not kill you, can tell
eating 12 croissants, confess done it, long run, long time
ago can't tell necessarily going good
gonna make lose weight. belief effects not lying
cases, experiments notice subjects didn't prior knowledge
grehlin effects daily routine weight loss blood
pressure. order work naive information, right?
can't simply lie tell want believe
important, also important mind body fascinating
interplay. today talked mainly body things put
inside tube, runs mouth end rectum, basically
impacting cells, neurons, microbiota mucosal lining, heart, lungs
information feeding brain impact feel here.
also feel impacting body reacts levels core
physiology couldn't just tell gonna work,
believe certain substances, certain foods, certain nutrients profound
effect magnitude impact

off supplements Thorne makes. today's episode, took full journey
brain body relationship discussed lot mechanisms
actionable items can approach want explore aspect biology
psychology further. Last, certainly not least, want thank everybody
time attention today, always, thank interest science.


sounding like baby, BBB. guess like BB, anyway, BBB, also nerves
gut sensing nutrient contents food saying, oh,
feel better want more. Oh, got lot bitterness acid taste it.
want less that. transitioned discussion dopamine
serotonin gut hopefully got actionable items belt,
pun intended, can understand certain foods certain nutrients
can look up, might impact mood. somebody really anxious
really wired. Well, dopamine adrenaline pathway epinephrine pathway
probably not one want lean harder. tend someone
pretty passive trouble motivation. Well think ramping
dopamine pathway through, always think behaviors proper food choices
best way start. behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.

00:54:55 Exercise: Powerful Mood Enhancer, Lacks Specificity

one problems discussion around mood exercise mood
meditation subjective. like, love certain forms exercise not
others. Certain ones aversive me. Certain ones attractive me, never
really clear. No one's ever told me. Okay, 10 minutes bike X
number RPM so-and-so skier order get dopamine up.
can actually say, ingest L-tyrosine high probability going
make dopamine. talking ingesting food
supplementation like. Mucuna pruriens, tried. just mention
dopaminergic me. got really, really jazzed severe crash
next day. that's, think tend ride pretty high kind alertness
motivation scale. always told Costello people podcast
studio slow speech down. uncaffeinated, probably afford
little serotonin life. So, whereas Costello, can afford wake every
couple days just say hello us. dog sleeps creature.
remarkable. things can actionable.
ways quantitative can regulate dosages can
regulate amounts can regulate timing. everyone play
things figure right terms feeding. everyone
explore understand safe right them. But, course, exercise


still important. talked social connection last episode super important
activation serotonin comes gut brain, body brain relationship,
eat really matters terms neurochemicals make.

00:56:45 Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil Alleviating Depression

talk little bit things ingest body allow
body inform brain shift mood. something
years. just want say found complete game changer.
excellent science support it. think people familiar different
context don't think people know simple fact omega-3
omega-6 fatty acid ratio profound effect depression. profound effect
mood much double-blind placebo controlled study will provide
link too, study first published 2008 there've many others well.
First all, experiment done animals. found model learned
helplessness animals. not kind animals, put rats mice
jar. let swim swim, swim, swim try save life.
eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially
done humans although didn't swim point near drowning.
took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,
appetite, sorts negative health effects. comparison thousand
milligrams day EPA. EPA one elements contains high levels
omega-3's things like fish oil, talk sources little bit
wasn't thousand milligrams fish oil. thousand milligrams EPA. Compared
20 milligrams Fluoxetine Prozac, okay. Really increases serotonin.
study 60 individuals, again, provide links study. found
equally effective reducing depressive symptoms. imagine that,
food-based compound can't make without, right, not situation
can make omega-3s. get food sources
supplementation, effective 20 milligrams fluoxetine course eight


weeks. really interesting addition combination
thousand milligrams EPA Fluoxetine synergistic effect lowering
depressive symptoms. find remarkable. heard first came
wasn't sure make it. 'Cause lot studies come
generally like focus changes behavior around things large
center mass. lot information. couple years later, fact start taking
thousand milligrams per day EPA fish oil. Now side effects fish
oil. People blood, bleeders Factor V Leiden mutations
women taking birth control, can affect blood clotting things
sort really talk doctor make sure okay you. Fish oil also can give
people fishy breath pretty gross, frankly, now fish oils either
Encapsulations put lemon flavoring
doesn't effect. event, thousand milligrams per day EPA. started
ingesting regularly. just felt better. wasn't clinically depressed, generally,
feel least me, increase mood affect. number things
supposed reduce inflammation. cardiovascular effects controversial long
time everyone thought effects platelets really terrific.
articles came major newspapers saying maybe not much effects
mood really profound. now lots studies.

01:01:00 Fish Oil Antidepressant

go PubMed put EPA fish oil depression find
number really impressive results showing least
effective certain SSRI antidepressants dosages can amplify improve
effect low dosages SSRIs. feel like people
know this. nutrition, profoundly affecting mood depression
terrible, right? Depression can component anxiety cases
people feel lousy uncertain. kind talk depression
anxiety talk someone anxious can tell everything's
gonna okay. always concerned might not know.
don't really know plane isn't gonna crash. don't really know life gonna go
okay. sense, right, no one crystal ball can predict
future, tend perseverate fixate uncertainty. course


versions depression involve certainty. People lethargic
certain say, yeah, certain, never gonna get another job. certain,
never gonna meet anyone new. certain gonna fail. kind divide
sphere depression around certainty uncertainty. interesting
thousand milligrams per day EPA shown relieve forms
depression. Now, mean gonna work everybody? No, not
try play psychiatrist. want point direction manuscripts
can make informed choices yourself. can discuss doctor
family make choices right you. especially
interesting heart effects, heard omega-3s,

01:02:40 EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain

course can get sources too, can get fatty fish,
flax seeds, hemp seeds. number chia seeds, kinds things
levels EPA required quite high. thousand milligrams per day
pretty hard get food although can done depending
eating. interesting heart effects solid really stand
literature lot something talked previous episode.
mention again, heart rate variability. know heart rate
really high heart rate, really low. Neither good. lot people
think, oh just want low heart rate, big stroke volume. know, running
lot may 30 40 beats per minute. great shape still want
heart rate variability. lot tone autonomic nervous system
talked last time. How, inhale, speeds heart rate. exhale,
decreases heart rate. called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. basis
heart rate variability. maybe short post this. can get
mechanism behaviors spill might useful you.
point heart rate variability. HRV good. interesting
study 2009 showed people eat diet fail supplement
way high omega-6 three ratio, not enough omega-3s, not
markers inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 TNF-alpha,
tend non-responders antidepressants. Shifting omega-3 omega-6 ratio
couple things. First all, increasing amount EPA shifted ratio.


higher omega-3 omega-6 ratio, good, lowered inflammation markers,
allowed antidepressants effect, even low doses.
really interesting thing. worked increasing heart rate variability, think, well,
world happen? know mean, ton effects
way works way things impacting gut
autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, said, vagus includes connections
heart signaling sensory information fast heart beating
brain not just stuff lungs, information heart brain
adjusts heart rate heart rate variability. incredible way one
can use gut, ingestion EPA's, either food
supplementation increase rate variability thereby improve symptoms, meaning
reduce symptoms depression, even make low levels antidepressants
wouldn't otherwise work work. think like study much a, super
cool. bridges brain body access. incorporates nutrition micronutrients
brain also really points something hear time,
body whole system. working whole system brain isn't working
isolation skull. reacting things happening body
gut heart rate heart rate variability. things ingest can
profound effect them. Now, course, really want emphasize something
no one compound nutrient supplement drug behavior
matter going end shifting depression improving one's
mood improving sleep. constellation things. especially true
people start get excited supplements drugs kinds potential
various things. Right now, lot excitement psychedelics
therapeutic uses. think great, good friend mine physician
clinician says better living chemistry still requires better living. cannot
expect take compound regardless source potency completely shift
experience life without continue engage proper behaviors,
things know proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.
many others well. still find collection studies omega-3
omega-6 ratios profoundly important much completely changed
way think food, foods eat, supplement. don't necessarily think
everybody really think incredible compounds
robust effects feelings wellbeing.



01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either
food supplementation. acknowledge not everyone wants take fish oil.
couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment
makes not want ingest fish related products. krill oil. Krill still
organism. little tiny thing whales eat lot people generally eat little
of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.
preference. people really like krill oil source omega-3s. mention
sources like chia seeds flax seeds, notice
not things tend ingest lot regular basis. possible get omega-3s
meats. animals grazed grasses contain lot omega-3s.
ingest meat source meat gonna important
relates omega-3s. Even within category fish oil concern
sometimes mercury contaminants. want go brand
emphasizes gone really good sources decontaminate
regardless. search brands. test can


01:09:05 L-Carnitine Mood, Sperm Ovary Quality, Autism, Fibromyalgia,
Migraine

whether not fish oil rancid not. people take liquid form.
people take capsule form. liquid form gonna affordable. capsule
form little easier little portable. can actually just chew one
gel tablets. tastes really fishy kind rancid, know disgusting.
want spit out. doesn't tolerable know okay.
Unfortunately buy first order that. Although, don't know, maybe
can get open bottle store tell want try


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall
around brain barrier brain important.
feature neurons don't recreate injury, like
organs body. not lot turnover cells despite might've
heard. nature created BBB, blood brain barrier make sure
certain molecules particular, large molecules don't get across blood-brain barrier.
'Cause can damaging tissues. Incidentally, also rigid
stringent barrier around organs, gonads. ovaries
testes brain organs body nature gone way
protect, give additional layer blood-brain barrier might imagine
testes ovaries, going blood gonadal barrier. barriers
exist make just eat something, just ingest
doesn't mean going cross blood-brain barrier, L-carnitine taken
acetylated converted form gets across blood-brain barrier.
lot effects, involved mitochondrial activation long chain fatty acids
big mouthful, get time talking metabolic,
interesting effects neuro side. decide check
examine.com see really interesting things, lots effects ammonia, C-


reactive proteins, things sort, blood glucose lowered, et cetera. stuff
level blood periphery, slight effects lowering cholesterol.
interesting ones. Rates pregnancy go way people taking L-carnitine
father mother source sperm source egg affected
ways favors pregnancy. increase, go sperm quality
sperm motility males seems positive effects females
polycystic ovary syndrome. check out. know, effects strong.
three studies listed there. Again, not promoting this, people
take L-carnitine, especially trying get pregnant check
effects studies mentioned published peer reviewed rigorous
journals. terms neural effects. quite interesting. effects
depression still emerging seem exist people feel notable
decrease depressive symptoms. seven studies listed examine.com
notable benefit variety circumstances participants heightened
depression already. start taking L-carnitine start feeling better.
talk dosages various studies. also shown notable
decrease symptoms autism, find fascinating. Also again, things
ingest impact chemicals brain impact rest body.
things used treat certain forms alcohol dependence.
think going exciting emerging area. gonna whole month
addiction. got great guest lined month, now
emerging field people can take supplement help ease cravings
withdrawal trying quit drugs abuse, like cocaine, alcohol, heroin,
smoking things sort. really interesting area. is, like think
early days gonna discover lot more. huge list things here. Since
talked pain previous episode know lot people written

Okay. now turn another aspect gut-brain relationship will surprise
you, cases might shock you. really cool actionable

01:16:29 Gut-Microbiome: Myths, Truths & Tubes Within Us

think super interesting potential therapeutics various people.
deal gut microbiome gut brain axis. Today actually
talking lot already gut brain axis nothing
microbiomes. talking vagus nerve connects providing
sensory information body brain. brain also sends
nerve motor information control motility got heart rate fast
breathe deployment immune stuff killer cells things sort.
oftentimes hear gut brain axis days, discussion
gut microbiome. again, situation incredible biology,
happy much discussion gut microbiome. somewhat
dismayed concerned hear either false partially
false. gonna clear misconceptions, first understanding

just talk general rules thumb related research quality research
peer reviewed. future episode

01:21:55 Probiotics, Brain Fog, Autism, Fermentation

will go far deeper gut microbiome gut brain axis. things
think might find surprising. First all, supporting healthy gut microbiome
good mood, great digestion great immune system function. However,
not mean maxing taking probiotic prebiotic can
possibly manage. mentioned many times believe probiotics, take
probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case
better. things like brain fog can come that, brain fog just
inability focus. People feel really not well generally. studies
little bit controversial think fair say people really increase amount
probiotic taking beyond certain amount start feeling foggy
mind. Now much? Well get probiotics mentioned Athletic
Greens, can get fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,
different sources around world. Actually, love hear
sources people know foods around world. fascinated
way different cultures arrived foods provide support
healthy microbiomes fermented. colleague Stanford, Justin
Sonnenberg, talked this. don't want quote

different ways one that. people don't like fermented foods, however
people supplement it. isn't case better. know that.
true healthy gut microbiota shown improve symptoms
certain psychiatric illnesses well certain conditions like particular features along

dopamine. gut microbiome provides kind foundation healthy gut
healthy gut brain access much people report start eating
small bits 'cause doesn't require lot fermented foods, overall mood
better, not unlike effects EPA. Although don't think looked directly
context clinical depression yet. someone knows study please mention
comments. terrific. things can really
damage gut microbiome. huge misconception want
clear up. study published "Nature", among three
top journals science. know, "Nature", "Science"

01:25:20 Artificial Sweeteners & Gut Microbiome: NOT Bad; Depends!

"Cell" considered top tops, excellent journal showed artificial
sweeteners particular artificial sweetener saccharin can disrupt gut
microbiome ways detrimental number different health markers,
increasing inflammatory cytokines bad things happen gut
microbiome thrown off kilter. study widely discussed
things not mentioned really important. study
saccharin particular. Saccharin not typical artificial sweetener used,
typical artificial sweeteners used things like aspartame, so-called
NutraSweet Sucralose, days Stevia, monk fruits, knowledge
please correct anyone knows studies, knowledge, negative
effects artificial sweeteners gut microbiome restricted saccharin.
Now enough chemical similarity saccharin ones
mentioned, not them. instance, Stevia, monk fruit distinct
chemical makeup probably don't any, lower effects,
negative effects gut microbiome, still tested. saccharin
really, shown study several studies can really negatively impact
quality gut microbiome. Interestingly, narrative around artificial sweeteners
gut microbiome incorrect. people thought, oh, saccharin bad
microbiome. must kill microbiome. hear people saying, oh, artificial
sweeteners kill microbiome. not true all. fact, study
published nature showed negative affects saccharin
microbiome blocked eliminated giving antibiotics. happens


certain artificial sweeteners particular saccharin disrupt microbiome make
environment within gut mucosal lining favorable bacteria microbiota
not good organism. important distinction. not just language
thing people say, oh, know, kills microbiome. doesn't kill
microbiome. shifts microbiome shifts microbiome can good
can bad. takes us another topic bit hot button topic

01:28:00 Ketogenic, Vegan, & Processed Food Effects, Individual Differences

willing go there. 'Cause think deserves conversation, nowadays
many examples people switched kind standard
diet even vegetarian diet vegan diet, keto diet. Now keto doesn't
necessarily mean ingestion meats, can. experience
positive effects themselves. Not everybody. talked previously
kind incorrect, believe incorrect marketing keto relates
cosmetic effects challenges sleep people
people love keto works great them. ketogenic diet interesting
one shifts ketogenic diet shift gut microbiome.
people end feeling better. people end feeling worse. Likewise,
people go ingesting animal products including meat vegetarian
go vegan experience positive shifts mood affect. know
transition plant-based diet especially enrichment fiber
present diets also creates dramatic shifts gut microbiome. people
feel better that. people feel worse. course, gonna depend
whether not ingesting lot processed foods not. paper
published "Cell", "Cell Press" journal obviously, excellent journal, showing
ingestion processed foods, regardless whether not come animal
sources non-animal sources processed foods tend create activity
within body surely roots nervous system lead over-
consumption calories weight gain. Even weight gain couldn't
explained increased calories. words, processed foods bad, regardless
whether not talking animal products non animal products, probably not
surprising given know sugar sensing amino acid sensing

advice. note fasting. colleague Yale, expert

01:33:20 Fasting-Based Depletion Microbiome

gut microbiome. told something really interesting,
fast, actually digest certain components within dietary tract. actually depletes
good amount gut microbiome. interesting. good results
guess call intermittent kind circadian type fasting never
done long fast, push first meal hours first meal
generally around lunchtime longer periods fasting go day
two three days known deplete gut microbiome major ways. not
always necessarily bad thing replenished, often replenished
levels exceeded previous level. think GI tract even
mental effects returning eating feeding sometimes people don't
feel good start eating. really want food, start eating
again. don't feel good fast. may related
depletion microbiome occurs long fast. again, something
think talk doctor, idea fasting across board
good. may merits that, certainly cases,
deplete microbiome depletion microbiome significant
means return eating, actually not position digest
assimilate foods. foods not position impact
brain body way prior fast. is, think people
suggest kind gradual transition back consuming nutrients fast.
round up, want share results without question will impact
way respond food mentally even physically. know
central theme studies tell about.

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues
experiment took housekeepers, essentially hotel workers,


divide two groups. watch short film. one case, film
work important help people feel comfortable hotel, et
cetera, et cetera. group heard activity

01:38:30 Mindset Controls Metabolism

period followed short tutorial. found eight weeks later,
group told activity good showed lower blood
pressure. lost significant amount body fat reported enjoying
work far group. work, simply biased mentally
information given, physiology followed information.
not just placebo effect. incredible set findings illustrate
extent whether not believe food gonna good us not good
us. Well, can't escape reality. can't tell poison gonna
good ingest poison expect not kill you, can tell
eating 12 croissants, confess done it, long run, long time
ago can't tell necessarily going good
gonna make lose weight. belief effects not lying
cases, experiments notice subjects didn't prior knowledge
grehlin effects daily routine weight loss blood
pressure. order work naive information, right?
can't simply lie tell want believe
important, also important mind body fascinating
interplay. today talked mainly body things put
inside tube, runs mouth end rectum, basically
impacting cells, neurons, microbiota mucosal lining, heart, lungs
information feeding brain impact feel here.
also feel impacting body reacts levels core
physiology couldn't just tell gonna work,
believe certain substances, certain foods, certain nutrients profound
effect magnitude impact

still important. talked social connection last episode super important
activation serotonin comes gut brain, body brain relationship,
eat really matters terms neurochemicals make.

00:56:45 Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil Alleviating Depression

talk little bit things ingest body allow
body inform brain shift mood. something
years. just want say found complete game changer.
excellent science support it. think people familiar different
context don't think people know simple fact omega-3
omega-6 fatty acid ratio profound effect depression. profound effect
mood much double-blind placebo controlled study will provide
link too, study first published 2008 there've many others well.
First all, experiment done animals. found model learned
helplessness animals. not kind animals, put rats mice
jar. let swim swim, swim, swim try save life.
eventually give up, learned helplessness. don't let drown, take
out. Adjusting omega-3 omega-6 ratio omega-3's higher led
less learned helplessness, meaning animals swim longer. Now
animal. rat, not particularly kind study, study essentially
done humans although didn't swim point near drowning.
took people clinically depressed, major depression.
Major depression severe maladaptive state meaning inhibits job, relationships,
appetite, sorts negative health effects. comparison thousand
milligrams day EPA. EPA one elements contains high levels
omega-3's things like fish oil, talk sources little bit
wasn't thousand milligrams fish oil. thousand milligrams EPA. Compared
20 milligrams Fluoxetine Prozac, okay. Really increases serotonin.
study 60 individuals, again, provide links study. found
equally effective reducing depressive symptoms. imagine that,
food-based compound can't make without, right, not situation
can make omega-3s. get food sources
supplementation, effective 20 milligrams fluoxetine course eight


weeks. really interesting addition combination
thousand milligrams EPA Fluoxetine synergistic effect lowering
depressive symptoms. find remarkable. heard first came
wasn't sure make it. 'Cause lot studies come
generally like focus changes behavior around things large
center mass. lot information. couple years later, fact start taking
thousand milligrams per day EPA fish oil. Now side effects fish
oil. People blood, bleeders Factor V Leiden mutations
women taking birth control, can affect blood clotting things
sort really talk doctor make sure okay you. Fish oil also can give
people fishy breath pretty gross, frankly, now fish oils either
Encapsulations put lemon flavoring
doesn't effect. event, thousand milligrams per day EPA. started
ingesting regularly. just felt better. wasn't clinically depressed, generally,
feel least me, increase mood affect. number things
supposed reduce inflammation. cardiovascular effects controversial long
time everyone thought effects platelets really terrific.
articles came major newspapers saying maybe not much effects
mood really profound. now lots studies.

01:01:00 Fish Oil Antidepressant

go PubMed put EPA fish oil depression find
number really impressive results showing least
effective certain SSRI antidepressants dosages can amplify improve
effect low dosages SSRIs. feel like people
know this. nutrition, profoundly affecting mood depression
terrible, right? Depression can component anxiety cases
people feel lousy uncertain. kind talk depression
anxiety talk someone anxious can tell everything's
gonna okay. always concerned might not know.
don't really know plane isn't gonna crash. don't really know life gonna go
okay. sense, right, no one crystal ball can predict
future, tend perseverate fixate uncertainty. course


versions depression involve certainty. People lethargic
certain say, yeah, certain, never gonna get another job. certain,
never gonna meet anyone new. certain gonna fail. kind divide
sphere depression around certainty uncertainty. interesting
thousand milligrams per day EPA shown relieve forms
depression. Now, mean gonna work everybody? No, not
try play psychiatrist. want point direction manuscripts
can make informed choices yourself. can discuss doctor
family make choices right you. especially
interesting heart effects, heard omega-3s,

01:02:40 EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain

course can get sources too, can get fatty fish,
flax seeds, hemp seeds. number chia seeds, kinds things
levels EPA required quite high. thousand milligrams per day
pretty hard get food although can done depending
eating. interesting heart effects solid really stand
literature lot something talked previous episode.
mention again, heart rate variability. know heart rate
really high heart rate, really low. Neither good. lot people
think, oh just want low heart rate, big stroke volume. know, running
lot may 30 40 beats per minute. great shape still want
heart rate variability. lot tone autonomic nervous system
talked last time. How, inhale, speeds heart rate. exhale,
decreases heart rate. called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. basis
heart rate variability. maybe short post this. can get
mechanism behaviors spill might useful you.
point heart rate variability. HRV good. interesting
study 2009 showed people eat diet fail supplement
way high omega-6 three ratio, not enough omega-3s, not
markers inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 TNF-alpha,
tend non-responders antidepressants. Shifting omega-3 omega-6 ratio
couple things. First all, increasing amount EPA shifted ratio.


higher omega-3 omega-6 ratio, good, lowered inflammation markers,
allowed antidepressants effect, even low doses.
really interesting thing. worked increasing heart rate variability, think, well,
world happen? know mean, ton effects
way works way things impacting gut
autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, said, vagus includes connections
heart signaling sensory information fast heart beating
brain not just stuff lungs, information heart brain
adjusts heart rate heart rate variability. incredible way one
can use gut, ingestion EPA's, either food
supplementation increase rate variability thereby improve symptoms, meaning
reduce symptoms depression, even make low levels antidepressants
wouldn't otherwise work work. think like study much a, super
cool. bridges brain body access. incorporates nutrition micronutrients
brain also really points something hear time,
body whole system. working whole system brain isn't working
isolation skull. reacting things happening body
gut heart rate heart rate variability. things ingest can
profound effect them. Now, course, really want emphasize something
no one compound nutrient supplement drug behavior
matter going end shifting depression improving one's
mood improving sleep. constellation things. especially true
people start get excited supplements drugs kinds potential
various things. Right now, lot excitement psychedelics
therapeutic uses. think great, good friend mine physician
clinician says better living chemistry still requires better living. cannot
expect take compound regardless source potency completely shift
experience life without continue engage proper behaviors,
things know proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.
many others well. still find collection studies omega-3
omega-6 ratios profoundly important much completely changed
way think food, foods eat, supplement. don't necessarily think
everybody really think incredible compounds
robust effects feelings wellbeing.



01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either
food supplementation. acknowledge not everyone wants take fish oil.
couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment
makes not want ingest fish related products. krill oil. Krill still
organism. little tiny thing whales eat lot people generally eat little
of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.
preference. people really like krill oil source omega-3s. mention
sources like chia seeds flax seeds, notice
not things tend ingest lot regular basis. possible get omega-3s
meats. animals grazed grasses contain lot omega-3s.
ingest meat source meat gonna important
relates omega-3s. Even within category fish oil concern
sometimes mercury contaminants. want go brand
emphasizes gone really good sources decontaminate
regardless. search brands. test can


01:09:05 L-Carnitine Mood, Sperm Ovary Quality, Autism, Fibromyalgia,
Migraine

whether not fish oil rancid not. people take liquid form.
people take capsule form. liquid form gonna affordable. capsule
form little easier little portable. can actually just chew one
gel tablets. tastes really fishy kind rancid, know disgusting.
want spit out. doesn't tolerable know okay.
Unfortunately buy first order that. Although, don't know, maybe
can get open bottle store tell want try


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall
around brain barrier brain important.
feature neurons don't recreate injury, like
organs body. not lot turnover cells despite might've
heard. nature created BBB, blood brain barrier make sure
certain molecules particular, large molecules don't get across blood-brain barrier.
'Cause can damaging tissues. Incidentally, also rigid
stringent barrier around organs, gonads. ovaries
testes brain organs body nature gone way
protect, give additional layer blood-brain barrier might imagine
testes ovaries, going blood gonadal barrier. barriers
exist make just eat something, just ingest
doesn't mean going cross blood-brain barrier, L-carnitine taken
acetylated converted form gets across blood-brain barrier.
lot effects, involved mitochondrial activation long chain fatty acids
big mouthful, get time talking metabolic,
interesting effects neuro side. decide check
examine.com see really interesting things, lots effects ammonia, C-


reactive proteins, things sort, blood glucose lowered, et cetera. stuff
level blood periphery, slight effects lowering cholesterol.
interesting ones. Rates pregnancy go way people taking L-carnitine
father mother source sperm source egg affected
ways favors pregnancy. increase, go sperm quality
sperm motility males seems positive effects females
polycystic ovary syndrome. check out. know, effects strong.
three studies listed there. Again, not promoting this, people
take L-carnitine, especially trying get pregnant check
effects studies mentioned published peer reviewed rigorous
journals. terms neural effects. quite interesting. effects
depression still emerging seem exist people feel notable
decrease depressive symptoms. seven studies listed examine.com
notable benefit variety circumstances participants heightened
depression already. start taking L-carnitine start feeling better.
talk dosages various studies. also shown notable
decrease symptoms autism, find fascinating. Also again, things
ingest impact chemicals brain impact rest body.
things used treat certain forms alcohol dependence.
think going exciting emerging area. gonna whole month
addiction. got great guest lined month, now
emerging field people can take supplement help ease cravings
withdrawal trying quit drugs abuse, like cocaine, alcohol, heroin,
smoking things sort. really interesting area. is, like think
early days gonna discover lot more. huge list things here. Since
talked pain previous episode know lot people written
fibromyalgia. L carnitine shown reduce symptoms
fibromyalgia. Again, links studies examine.com, totally free site.
bulldog battering ram. nothing graceful bulldog.
decided wanted leave go get drink water. please forgive noise.
Okay. now turn another aspect gut-brain relationship will surprise
you, cases might shock you. really cool actionable
biology. gut microbiome, probiotics prebiotics. know today
talking emotions not pain remiss didn't mention another effect


acetylcarnitine reported can find listed link study
examine.com effect reducing symptoms migraine.
randomized controlled trial 133 participants frequent migraines.
taking 500 milligrams L-carnitine nothing 12 weeks. control little bit,

colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues

weeks. really interesting addition combination
thousand milligrams EPA Fluoxetine synergistic effect lowering

wasn't sure make it. 'Cause lot studies come
generally like focus changes behavior around things large
center mass. lot information. couple years later, fact start taking
thousand milligrams per day EPA fish oil. Now side effects fish
oil. People blood, bleeders Factor V Leiden mutations
women taking birth control, can affect blood clotting things
sort really talk doctor make sure okay you. Fish oil also can give
people fishy breath pretty gross, frankly, now fish oils either
Encapsulations put lemon flavoring
doesn't effect. event, thousand milligrams per day EPA. started
ingesting regularly. just felt better. wasn't clinically depressed, generally,
feel least me, increase mood affect. number things
supposed reduce inflammation. cardiovascular effects controversial long
time everyone thought effects platelets really terrific.
articles came major newspapers saying maybe not much effects
mood really profound. now lots studies.

01:01:00 Fish Oil Antidepressant

go PubMed put EPA fish oil depression find
number really impressive results showing least
effective certain SSRI antidepressants dosages can amplify improve
effect low dosages SSRIs. feel like people
know this. nutrition, profoundly affecting mood depression
terrible, right? Depression can component anxiety cases
people feel lousy uncertain. kind talk depression
anxiety talk someone anxious can tell everything's
gonna okay. always concerned might not know.
don't really know plane isn't gonna crash. don't really know life gonna go
okay. sense, right, no one crystal ball can predict

versions depression involve certainty. People lethargic
certain say, yeah, certain, never gonna get another job. certain,
never gonna meet anyone new. certain gonna fail. kind divide
sphere depression around certainty uncertainty. interesting
thousand milligrams per day EPA shown relieve forms
depression. Now, mean gonna work everybody? No, not
try play psychiatrist. want point direction manuscripts
can make informed choices yourself. can discuss doctor
family make choices right you. especially
interesting heart effects, heard omega-3s,

01:02:40 EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain

course can get sources too, can get fatty fish,
flax seeds, hemp seeds. number chia seeds, kinds things
levels EPA required quite high. thousand milligrams per day
pretty hard get food although can done depending
eating. interesting heart effects solid really stand
literature lot something talked previous episode.
mention again, heart rate variability. know heart rate
really high heart rate, really low. Neither good. lot people
think, oh just want low heart rate, big stroke volume. know, running
lot may 30 40 beats per minute. great shape still want
heart rate variability. lot tone autonomic nervous system
talked last time. How, inhale, speeds heart rate. exhale,
decreases heart rate. called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. basis
heart rate variability. maybe short post this. can get
mechanism behaviors spill might useful you.
point heart rate variability. HRV good. interesting
study 2009 showed people eat diet fail supplement
way high omega-6 three ratio, not enough omega-3s, not
markers inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 TNF-alpha,
tend non-responders antidepressants. Shifting omega-3 omega-6 ratio
couple things. First all, increasing amount EPA shifted ratio.


higher omega-3 omega-6 ratio, good, lowered inflammation markers,
allowed antidepressants effect, even low doses.
really interesting thing. worked increasing heart rate variability, think, well,
world happen? know mean, ton effects
way works way things impacting gut
autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, said, vagus includes connections
heart signaling sensory information fast heart beating
brain not just stuff lungs, information heart brain
adjusts heart rate heart rate variability. incredible way one
can use gut, ingestion EPA's, either food
supplementation increase rate variability thereby improve symptoms, meaning
reduce symptoms depression, even make low levels antidepressants
wouldn't otherwise work work. think like study much a, super
cool. bridges brain body access. incorporates nutrition micronutrients

body whole system. working whole system brain isn't working
isolation skull. reacting things happening body
gut heart rate heart rate variability. things ingest can
profound effect them. Now, course, really want emphasize something
no one compound nutrient supplement drug behavior

people start get excited supplements drugs kinds potential
various things. Right now, lot excitement psychedelics
therapeutic uses. think great, good friend mine physician

expect take compound regardless source potency completely shift
experience life without continue engage proper behaviors,
things know proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.
many others well. still find collection studies omega-3
omega-6 ratios profoundly important much completely changed

everybody really think incredible compounds
robust effects feelings wellbeing.



01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either
food supplementation. acknowledge not everyone wants take fish oil.
couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment
makes not want ingest fish related products. krill oil. Krill still
organism. little tiny thing whales eat lot people generally eat little
of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.
preference. people really like krill oil source omega-3s. mention
sources like chia seeds flax seeds, notice
not things tend ingest lot regular basis. possible get omega-3s
meats. animals grazed grasses contain lot omega-3s.
ingest meat source meat gonna important
relates omega-3s. Even within category fish oil concern
sometimes mercury contaminants. want go brand
emphasizes gone really good sources decontaminate
regardless. search brands. test can


01:09:05 L-Carnitine Mood, Sperm Ovary Quality, Autism, Fibromyalgia,
Migraine

whether not fish oil rancid not. people take liquid form.
people take capsule form. liquid form gonna affordable. capsule
form little easier little portable. can actually just chew one
gel tablets. tastes really fishy kind rancid, know disgusting.
want spit out. doesn't tolerable know okay.
Unfortunately buy first order that. Although, don't know, maybe
can get open bottle store tell want try


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall
around brain barrier brain important.
feature neurons don't recreate injury, like
organs body. not lot turnover cells despite might've
heard. nature created BBB, blood brain barrier make sure
certain molecules particular, large molecules don't get across blood-brain barrier.
'Cause can damaging tissues. Incidentally, also rigid

doesn't mean going cross blood-brain barrier, L-carnitine taken
acetylated converted form gets across blood-brain barrier.
lot effects, involved mitochondrial activation long chain fatty acids
big mouthful, get time talking metabolic,

depression still emerging seem exist people feel notable
decrease depressive symptoms. seven studies listed examine.com
notable benefit variety circumstances participants heightened
depression already. start taking L-carnitine start feeling better.
talk dosages various studies. also shown notable
decrease symptoms autism, find fascinating. Also again, things

emerging field people can take supplement help ease cravings
withdrawal trying quit drugs abuse, like cocaine, alcohol, heroin,
smoking things sort. really interesting area. is, like think
early days gonna discover lot more. huge list things here. Since
talked pain previous episode know lot people written
fibromyalgia. L carnitine shown reduce symptoms
fibromyalgia. Again, links studies examine.com, totally free site.
bulldog battering ram. nothing graceful bulldog.
decided wanted leave go get drink water. please forgive noise.
Okay. now turn another aspect gut-brain relationship will surprise
you, cases might shock you. really cool actionable

versions depression involve certainty. People lethargic
certain say, yeah, certain, never gonna get another job. certain,
never gonna meet anyone new. certain gonna fail. kind divide
sphere depression around certainty uncertainty. interesting
thousand milligrams per day EPA shown relieve forms
depression. Now, mean gonna work everybody? No, not
try play psychiatrist. want point direction manuscripts
can make informed choices yourself. can discuss doctor
family make choices right you. especially
interesting heart effects, heard omega-3s,

01:02:40 EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain

course can get sources too, can get fatty fish,
flax seeds, hemp seeds. number chia seeds, kinds things
levels EPA required quite high. thousand milligrams per day
pretty hard get food although can done depending
eating. interesting heart effects solid really stand
literature lot something talked previous episode.
mention again, heart rate variability. know heart rate
really high heart rate, really low. Neither good. lot people
think, oh just want low heart rate, big stroke volume. know, running
lot may 30 40 beats per minute. great shape still want
heart rate variability. lot tone autonomic nervous system
talked last time. How, inhale, speeds heart rate. exhale,
decreases heart rate. called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. basis
heart rate variability. maybe short post this. can get
mechanism behaviors spill might useful you.
point heart rate variability. HRV good. interesting
study 2009 showed people eat diet fail supplement
way high omega-6 three ratio, not enough omega-3s, not
markers inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 TNF-alpha,
tend non-responders antidepressants. Shifting omega-3 omega-6 ratio
couple things. First all, increasing amount EPA shifted ratio.


higher omega-3 omega-6 ratio, good, lowered inflammation markers,
allowed antidepressants effect, even low doses.
really interesting thing. worked increasing heart rate variability, think, well,
world happen? know mean, ton effects
way works way things impacting gut
autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, said, vagus includes connections
heart signaling sensory information fast heart beating
brain not just stuff lungs, information heart brain
adjusts heart rate heart rate variability. incredible way one
can use gut, ingestion EPA's, either food
supplementation increase rate variability thereby improve symptoms, meaning
reduce symptoms depression, even make low levels antidepressants
wouldn't otherwise work work. think like study much a, super
cool. bridges brain body access. incorporates nutrition micronutrients
brain also really points something hear time,
body whole system. working whole system brain isn't working
isolation skull. reacting things happening body
gut heart rate heart rate variability. things ingest can
profound effect them. Now, course, really want emphasize something
no one compound nutrient supplement drug behavior
matter going end shifting depression improving one's
mood improving sleep. constellation things. especially true
people start get excited supplements drugs kinds potential
various things. Right now, lot excitement psychedelics
therapeutic uses. think great, good friend mine physician
clinician says better living chemistry still requires better living. cannot
expect take compound regardless source potency completely shift
experience life without continue engage proper behaviors,
things know proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.
many others well. still find collection studies omega-3
omega-6 ratios profoundly important much completely changed
way think food, foods eat, supplement. don't necessarily think
everybody really think incredible compounds
robust effects feelings wellbeing.



01:07:24 Alternatives Fish Oil Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs

others too. thousand milligram per day threshold fish oil
beneficial requires one take reasonable amount things, either
food supplementation. acknowledge not everyone wants take fish oil.
couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment
makes not want ingest fish related products. krill oil. Krill still
organism. little tiny thing whales eat lot people generally eat little
of. krill there, personally, just me, don't know why, didn't react well krill.
didn't make feel good. like kind skin itches things like that.
stopped stopped taking don't want bias it.
preference. people really like krill oil source omega-3s. mention
sources like chia seeds flax seeds, notice
not things tend ingest lot regular basis. possible get omega-3s
meats. animals grazed grasses contain lot omega-3s.
ingest meat source meat gonna important
relates omega-3s. Even within category fish oil concern
sometimes mercury contaminants. want go brand
emphasizes gone really good sources decontaminate
regardless. search brands. test can


01:09:05 L-Carnitine Mood, Sperm Ovary Quality, Autism, Fibromyalgia,
Migraine

whether not fish oil rancid not. people take liquid form.
people take capsule form. liquid form gonna affordable. capsule
form little easier little portable. can actually just chew one
gel tablets. tastes really fishy kind rancid, know disgusting.
want spit out. doesn't tolerable know okay.
Unfortunately buy first order that. Although, don't know, maybe
can get open bottle store tell want try


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall
around brain barrier brain important.
feature neurons don't recreate injury, like
organs body. not lot turnover cells despite might've
heard. nature created BBB, blood brain barrier make sure
certain molecules particular, large molecules don't get across blood-brain barrier.
'Cause can damaging tissues. Incidentally, also rigid
stringent barrier around organs, gonads. ovaries
testes brain organs body nature gone way
protect, give additional layer blood-brain barrier might imagine
testes ovaries, going blood gonadal barrier. barriers
exist make just eat something, just ingest
doesn't mean going cross blood-brain barrier, L-carnitine taken
acetylated converted form gets across blood-brain barrier.
lot effects, involved mitochondrial activation long chain fatty acids
big mouthful, get time talking metabolic,
interesting effects neuro side. decide check
examine.com see really interesting things, lots effects ammonia, C-


reactive proteins, things sort, blood glucose lowered, et cetera. stuff
level blood periphery, slight effects lowering cholesterol.
interesting ones. Rates pregnancy go way people taking L-carnitine
father mother source sperm source egg affected
ways favors pregnancy. increase, go sperm quality
sperm motility males seems positive effects females
polycystic ovary syndrome. check out. know, effects strong.
three studies listed there. Again, not promoting this, people
take L-carnitine, especially trying get pregnant check
effects studies mentioned published peer reviewed rigorous
journals. terms neural effects. quite interesting. effects
depression still emerging seem exist people feel notable
decrease depressive symptoms. seven studies listed examine.com
notable benefit variety circumstances participants heightened
depression already. start taking L-carnitine start feeling better.
talk dosages various studies. also shown notable
decrease symptoms autism, find fascinating. Also again, things
ingest impact chemicals brain impact rest body.
things used treat certain forms alcohol dependence.
think going exciting emerging area. gonna whole month
addiction. got great guest lined month, now
emerging field people can take supplement help ease cravings
withdrawal trying quit drugs abuse, like cocaine, alcohol, heroin,
smoking things sort. really interesting area. is, like think
early days gonna discover lot more. huge list things here. Since
talked pain previous episode know lot people written
fibromyalgia. L carnitine shown reduce symptoms
fibromyalgia. Again, links studies examine.com, totally free site.
bulldog battering ram. nothing graceful bulldog.
decided wanted leave go get drink water. please forgive noise.
Okay. now turn another aspect gut-brain relationship will surprise
you, cases might shock you. really cool actionable
biology. gut microbiome, probiotics prebiotics. know today
talking emotions not pain remiss didn't mention another effect


acetylcarnitine reported can find listed link study
examine.com effect reducing symptoms migraine.
randomized controlled trial 133 participants frequent migraines.
taking 500 milligrams L-carnitine nothing 12 weeks. control little bit,
control experiment little bit tricky significant effect reducing
number migraine attacks per month. find really interesting
lot listed study. think compounds powerful.
carry risks certain people, not others. again, find right


01:16:29 Gut-Microbiome: Myths, Truths & Tubes Within Us

think super interesting potential therapeutics various people.
deal gut microbiome gut brain axis. Today actually
talking lot already gut brain axis nothing
microbiomes. talking vagus nerve connects providing
sensory information body brain. brain also sends
nerve motor information control motility got heart rate fast
breathe deployment immune stuff killer cells things sort.
oftentimes hear gut brain axis days, discussion
gut microbiome. again, situation incredible biology,
happy much discussion gut microbiome. somewhat
dismayed concerned hear either false partially
false. gonna clear misconceptions, first understanding
biology. going talk actionable items. true
lot little microorganisms living gut. not
want help us. don't brains, adaptive however, try
find create environments make easier proliferate. don't
care perfectly willing exploit order
make way viruses are, viruses don't mind,
infect cells, hijack genome, use genome make
themselves. microbiota live us vary along length digestive tract.
just take step back think body plan made. actually
series tubes. brain actually tube. see, squishy outside.


got long thing. spinal cord goes base spine.
central nervous system started tube. just looks like
cauliflower end brain tube big
crammed skull. gets wrinkled up. splay find
just one big tube. Similarly, digestive tract airways essentially
one big tube. starts mouth, also nose.
tubes. go throat stomach
various intestines. tube ends end. one long tube
digestion. inside tube mucosal lining. little microvilli, tiny,
tiny, tiny little like velvety ends cells able move move things along
mucus mucosa. conditions mucosal lining set number different
things. sets rate digestion quality digestion. sets
instance, immune system. people probably don't realize this,
infections environment get body somehow.
inhaled. lot go mouth lodge mucosal lining mouth.
infection start there. probably experience, unfortunately,
know, feeling like tick throat, like something's irritating throat.
kind migrates head cold runny nose. Sometimes it'll start
headache. Sometimes won't, things inert can migrate gut.
ingesting things time. Think air, bacteria, viruses, making
way gut. bacteria live gut. bacteria
bias mucosal lining gut, stomach intestines acidic
basic can make can replicate. like
particular comfort. like like particular kind bedding lie create
themselves. Now, mucosal linings promote make
us feel better. make us feel alert. bolster immune system
others make us feel worse. first rule, microbiome isn't good bad.
little bugs live us bad things us. make us feel worse. lower
immunity. affect us negative ways. make us feel better
mainly changing conditions gut environment. addition
that, impact neurotransmitters neurons live gut.
signal brain impact things like dopamine serotonin
talking previously. vast world now devoted try understand
sources food kinds foods good not good gut microbiome?


just talk general rules thumb related research quality research
peer reviewed. future episode

01:21:55 Probiotics, Brain Fog, Autism, Fermentation

will go far deeper gut microbiome gut brain axis. things
think might find surprising. First all, supporting healthy gut microbiome
good mood, great digestion great immune system function. However,
not mean maxing taking probiotic prebiotic can
possibly manage. mentioned many times believe probiotics, take
probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case
better. things like brain fog can come that, brain fog just
inability focus. People feel really not well generally. studies
little bit controversial think fair say people really increase amount
probiotic taking beyond certain amount start feeling foggy
mind. Now much? Well get probiotics mentioned Athletic
Greens, can get fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,
different sources around world. Actually, love hear
sources people know foods around world. fascinated
way different cultures arrived foods provide support
healthy microbiomes fermented. colleague Stanford, Justin
Sonnenberg, talked this. don't want quote
inappropriately, discussions it, published
ingestion fermented foods one best ways support healthy levels gut
microbiota without exceeding threshold cause things like brain fog.
foods fermented foods going best source. number
different ways one that. people don't like fermented foods, however
people supplement it. isn't case better. know that.
true healthy gut microbiota shown improve symptoms
certain psychiatric illnesses well certain conditions like particular features along
autism spectrum, interesting. effects probably due not just
improvement immune system function, conditions neurons
sense nutrients convey information brain increase levels serotonin


dopamine. gut microbiome provides kind foundation healthy gut
healthy gut brain access much people report start eating
small bits 'cause doesn't require lot fermented foods, overall mood
better, not unlike effects EPA. Although don't think looked directly
context clinical depression yet. someone knows study please mention
comments. terrific. things can really
damage gut microbiome. huge misconception want
clear up. study published "Nature", among three
top journals science. know, "Nature", "Science"

01:25:20 Artificial Sweeteners & Gut Microbiome: NOT Bad; Depends!

"Cell" considered top tops, excellent journal showed artificial
sweeteners particular artificial sweetener saccharin can disrupt gut
microbiome ways detrimental number different health markers,
increasing inflammatory cytokines bad things happen gut
microbiome thrown off kilter. study widely discussed
things not mentioned really important. study
saccharin particular. Saccharin not typical artificial sweetener used,
typical artificial sweeteners used things like aspartame, so-called
NutraSweet Sucralose, days Stevia, monk fruits, knowledge
please correct anyone knows studies, knowledge, negative
effects artificial sweeteners gut microbiome restricted saccharin.
Now enough chemical similarity saccharin ones
mentioned, not them. instance, Stevia, monk fruit distinct
chemical makeup probably don't any, lower effects,
negative effects gut microbiome, still tested. saccharin
really, shown study several studies can really negatively impact
quality gut microbiome. Interestingly, narrative around artificial sweeteners
gut microbiome incorrect. people thought, oh, saccharin bad
microbiome. must kill microbiome. hear people saying, oh, artificial
sweeteners kill microbiome. not true all. fact, study
published nature showed negative affects saccharin
microbiome blocked eliminated giving antibiotics. happens


certain artificial sweeteners particular saccharin disrupt microbiome make
environment within gut mucosal lining favorable bacteria microbiota
not good organism. important distinction. not just language
thing people say, oh, know, kills microbiome. doesn't kill
microbiome. shifts microbiome shifts microbiome can good
can bad. takes us another topic bit hot button topic

01:28:00 Ketogenic, Vegan, & Processed Food Effects, Individual Differences

willing go there. 'Cause think deserves conversation, nowadays
many examples people switched kind standard
diet even vegetarian diet vegan diet, keto diet. Now keto doesn't
necessarily mean ingestion meats, can. experience
positive effects themselves. Not everybody. talked previously
kind incorrect, believe incorrect marketing keto relates
cosmetic effects challenges sleep people
people love keto works great them. ketogenic diet interesting
one shifts ketogenic diet shift gut microbiome.
people end feeling better. people end feeling worse. Likewise,
people go ingesting animal products including meat vegetarian
go vegan experience positive shifts mood affect. know
transition plant-based diet especially enrichment fiber
present diets also creates dramatic shifts gut microbiome. people
feel better that. people feel worse. course, gonna depend
whether not ingesting lot processed foods not. paper
published "Cell", "Cell Press" journal obviously, excellent journal, showing
ingestion processed foods, regardless whether not come animal
sources non-animal sources processed foods tend create activity
within body surely roots nervous system lead over-
consumption calories weight gain. Even weight gain couldn't
explained increased calories. words, processed foods bad, regardless
whether not talking animal products non animal products, probably not
surprising given know sugar sensing amino acid sensing
cells gut talked earlier. point say


find right you, not throwaway statement. people's
microbiome lining mucosa, excuse me, mucosa lining throat,
gut, nose, everything improved diets heavily meat based
don't many plants. people much better plant-based diet without
many meat products animal products. highly individual. probably
roots genetic makeup. probably roots people raised
remember nervous system course set genetic, genes,
genetic program nervous system adapts early life conditions.
for, reason nervous system move body appropriately
towards things good away things not. also
designed adapt. early life period incredible thing plasticity
spent whole month can change yes indeed people may like
certain foods react certain foods better others way
nervous system wired. enteric called nervous system lines gut
communicates brain. talked today kind
black white. things present us, sugar sensing
neurons gut, way vagus wired. fact omega-3 omega-6 tend
improve. ratios tend impact mood high omega-3. omega-6 ratios improving
mood. talked sorts things gut brain body brain axis,
comes microbiome key thing microbiome. want
microbiome, want promote microbiome right you. can
shifted steered ingesting certain categories foods not others. one
thing really frustrates people show agenda, like meat
agenda vegan agenda keto agenda, talk positive effects
gut microbiome. true, frankly. highly individual. Now
doesn't get ethical issues around animals planet, hear rabid
debates sides. not qualified equipped talk
whether not regenerative agriculture, animal products, farming
things, actually impact environment, not expertise,
comes health microbiome want support microbiome.
clear fermented foods support microbiome ingesting
least two servings per day. quite lot supplementation low levels can
good. Supplementation high levels can create brain fog even though people
say result controversial. experienced data looked


pretty darn solid. one thing think well. thing
gut microbiome highly contextual based things doing.
even things like exercise social well-being connection, things also
impacting gut microbiome. find diet right you. works
context ethical lifestyle choices important you.
advice. note fasting. colleague Yale, expert

01:33:20 Fasting-Based Depletion Microbiome

gut microbiome. told something really interesting,
fast, actually digest certain components within dietary tract. actually depletes
good amount gut microbiome. interesting. good results
guess call intermittent kind circadian type fasting never
done long fast, push first meal hours first meal
generally around lunchtime longer periods fasting go day
two three days known deplete gut microbiome major ways. not
always necessarily bad thing replenished, often replenished
levels exceeded previous level. think GI tract even
mental effects returning eating feeding sometimes people don't
feel good start eating. really want food, start eating
again. don't feel good fast. may related
depletion microbiome occurs long fast. again, something
think talk doctor, idea fasting across board
good. may merits that, certainly cases,
deplete microbiome depletion microbiome significant
means return eating, actually not position digest
assimilate foods. foods not position impact
brain body way prior fast. is, think people
suggest kind gradual transition back consuming nutrients fast.
round up, want share results without question will impact
way respond food mentally even physically. know
central theme studies tell about.

probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case

Now enough chemical similarity saccharin ones
mentioned, not them. instance, Stevia, monk fruit distinct

01:28:00 Ketogenic, Vegan, & Processed Food Effects, Individual Differences

willing go there. 'Cause think deserves conversation, nowadays
many examples people switched kind standard

people love keto works great them. ketogenic diet interesting
one shifts ketogenic diet shift gut microbiome.
people end feeling better. people end feeling worse. Likewise,
people go ingesting animal products including meat vegetarian
go vegan experience positive shifts mood affect. know
transition plant-based diet especially enrichment fiber
present diets also creates dramatic shifts gut microbiome. people
feel better that. people feel worse. course, gonna depend
whether not ingesting lot processed foods not. paper
published "Cell", "Cell Press" journal obviously, excellent journal, showing
ingestion processed foods, regardless whether not come animal
sources non-animal sources processed foods tend create activity
within body surely roots nervous system lead over-
consumption calories weight gain. Even weight gain couldn't
explained increased calories. words, processed foods bad, regardless
whether not talking animal products non animal products, probably not
surprising given know sugar sensing amino acid sensing
cells gut talked earlier. point say


find right you, not throwaway statement. people's
microbiome lining mucosa, excuse me, mucosa lining throat,
gut, nose, everything improved diets heavily meat based
don't many plants. people much better plant-based diet without

whether not regenerative agriculture, animal products, farming
things, actually impact environment, not expertise,
comes health microbiome want support microbiome.
clear fermented foods support microbiome ingesting

good. Supplementation high levels can create brain fog even though people
say result controversial. experienced data looked


pretty darn solid. one thing think well. thing

advice. note fasting. colleague Yale, expert

01:33:20 Fasting-Based Depletion Microbiome

gut microbiome. told something really interesting,
fast, actually digest certain components within dietary tract. actually depletes
good amount gut microbiome. interesting. good results
guess call intermittent kind circadian type fasting never
done long fast, push first meal hours first meal
generally around lunchtime longer periods fasting go day
two three days known deplete gut microbiome major ways. not
always necessarily bad thing replenished, often replenished
levels exceeded previous level. think GI tract even
mental effects returning eating feeding sometimes people don't
feel good start eating. really want food, start eating
again. don't feel good fast. may related
depletion microbiome occurs long fast. again, something
think talk doctor, idea fasting across board
good. may merits that, certainly cases,
deplete microbiome depletion microbiome significant
means return eating, actually not position digest
assimilate foods. foods not position impact
brain body way prior fast. is, think people
suggest kind gradual transition back consuming nutrients fast.
round up, want share results without question will impact
way respond food mentally even physically. know
central theme studies tell about.

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues
experiment took housekeepers, essentially hotel workers,


divide two groups. watch short film. one case, film
work important help people feel comfortable hotel, et
cetera, et cetera. group heard activity

01:38:30 Mindset Controls Metabolism

cleaning taking care hotel good them. good
health, et cetera, et cetera. controlled nicely study health
parameters, individual differences. behaviors people
period followed short tutorial. found eight weeks later,
group told activity good showed lower blood
pressure. lost significant amount body fat reported enjoying
work far group. work, simply biased mentally
information given, physiology followed information.
not just placebo effect. incredible set findings illustrate
extent whether not believe food gonna good us not good
us. Well, can't escape reality. can't tell poison gonna
good ingest poison expect not kill you, can tell
eating 12 croissants, confess done it, long run, long time
ago can't tell necessarily going good
gonna make lose weight. belief effects not lying
cases, experiments notice subjects didn't prior knowledge
grehlin effects daily routine weight loss blood
pressure. order work naive information, right?
can't simply lie tell want believe
important, also important mind body fascinating
interplay. today talked mainly body things put
inside tube, runs mouth end rectum, basically
impacting cells, neurons, microbiota mucosal lining, heart, lungs
information feeding brain impact feel here.
also feel impacting body reacts levels core
physiology couldn't just tell gonna work,
believe certain substances, certain foods, certain nutrients profound
effect magnitude impact

couple reasons one might want avoid that. One
ethical reasons. emotional relationship relationship environment

advice. note fasting. colleague Yale, expert

01:33:20 Fasting-Based Depletion Microbiome

gut microbiome. told something really interesting,
fast, actually digest certain components within dietary tract. actually depletes
good amount gut microbiome. interesting. good results
guess call intermittent kind circadian type fasting never
done long fast, push first meal hours first meal
generally around lunchtime longer periods fasting go day
two three days known deplete gut microbiome major ways. not
always necessarily bad thing replenished, often replenished
levels exceeded previous level. think GI tract even
mental effects returning eating feeding sometimes people don't
feel good start eating. really want food, start eating
again. don't feel good fast. may related
depletion microbiome occurs long fast. again, something
think talk doctor, idea fasting across board
good. may merits that, certainly cases,
deplete microbiome depletion microbiome significant
means return eating, actually not position digest
assimilate foods. foods not position impact
brain body way prior fast. is, think people
suggest kind gradual transition back consuming nutrients fast.
round up, want share results without question will impact
way respond food mentally even physically. know
central theme studies tell about.

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues
experiment took housekeepers, essentially hotel workers,


divide two groups. watch short film. one case, film
work important help people feel comfortable hotel, et
cetera, et cetera. group heard activity

01:38:30 Mindset Controls Metabolism

cleaning taking care hotel good them. good
health, et cetera, et cetera. controlled nicely study health
parameters, individual differences. behaviors people
period followed short tutorial. found eight weeks later,
group told activity good showed lower blood
pressure. lost significant amount body fat reported enjoying
work far group. work, simply biased mentally
information given, physiology followed information.
not just placebo effect. incredible set findings illustrate
extent whether not believe food gonna good us not good
us. Well, can't escape reality. can't tell poison gonna
good ingest poison expect not kill you, can tell
eating 12 croissants, confess done it, long run, long time
ago can't tell necessarily going good
gonna make lose weight. belief effects not lying
cases, experiments notice subjects didn't prior knowledge
grehlin effects daily routine weight loss blood
pressure. order work naive information, right?
can't simply lie tell want believe
important, also important mind body fascinating
interplay. today talked mainly body things put
inside tube, runs mouth end rectum, basically
impacting cells, neurons, microbiota mucosal lining, heart, lungs
information feeding brain impact feel here.
also feel impacting body reacts levels core
physiology couldn't just tell gonna work,
believe certain substances, certain foods, certain nutrients profound
effect magnitude impact

believe products support sponsors much otherwise
wouldn't working them. much mentioned supplements
talk supplements throughout course episodes, don't mention specific
brands, remiss didn't mention fact partnered
Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E. done know Thorne uses

off supplements Thorne makes. today's episode, took full journey
brain body relationship discussed lot mechanisms
actionable items can approach want explore aspect biology

time attention today, always, thank interest science.


it. Someday perhaps fish oil omega-3, it'll like tasting wine restaurant
can send back now. think purchase first, find brand
trust like, work them. decide go route course.
compounds also interesting mood elevation essentially like
foods supplement based now, fortunately, really good data
peer reviewed studies. next one want mention think really
interesting L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine around long time
discussed context heart health number things. actually
touted bit weight loss agent early nineties, L-carnitine actually
really impressive effects depression. again, will look PubMed
looking examine.com essentially anyway looking PubMed,
L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine prevalent meat beef particular. Now
vegans, please know L-carnitine available non-meat sources
well. Although not enriched non-meat sources. really interesting molecule
acetylcarnitine essentially made L-carnitine acetylated.
interested biochemistry, can look up, acetylated form
can cross blood-brain barrier. blood-brain barrier BBB barrier. wall
around brain barrier brain important.
feature neurons don't recreate injury, like
organs body. not lot turnover cells despite might've
heard. nature created BBB, blood brain barrier make sure
certain molecules particular, large molecules don't get across blood-brain barrier.
'Cause can damaging tissues. Incidentally, also rigid
stringent barrier around organs, gonads. ovaries
testes brain organs body nature gone way
protect, give additional layer blood-brain barrier might imagine
testes ovaries, going blood gonadal barrier. barriers
exist make just eat something, just ingest
doesn't mean going cross blood-brain barrier, L-carnitine taken
acetylated converted form gets across blood-brain barrier.
lot effects, involved mitochondrial activation long chain fatty acids
big mouthful, get time talking metabolic,
interesting effects neuro side. decide check
examine.com see really interesting things, lots effects ammonia, C-


reactive proteins, things sort, blood glucose lowered, et cetera. stuff
level blood periphery, slight effects lowering cholesterol.
interesting ones. Rates pregnancy go way people taking L-carnitine
father mother source sperm source egg affected
ways favors pregnancy. increase, go sperm quality
sperm motility males seems positive effects females
polycystic ovary syndrome. check out. know, effects strong.
three studies listed there. Again, not promoting this, people
take L-carnitine, especially trying get pregnant check
effects studies mentioned published peer reviewed rigorous
journals. terms neural effects. quite interesting. effects
depression still emerging seem exist people feel notable
decrease depressive symptoms. seven studies listed examine.com
notable benefit variety circumstances participants heightened
depression already. start taking L-carnitine start feeling better.
talk dosages various studies. also shown notable
decrease symptoms autism, find fascinating. Also again, things
ingest impact chemicals brain impact rest body.
things used treat certain forms alcohol dependence.
think going exciting emerging area. gonna whole month
addiction. got great guest lined month, now
emerging field people can take supplement help ease cravings
withdrawal trying quit drugs abuse, like cocaine, alcohol, heroin,
smoking things sort. really interesting area. is, like think
early days gonna discover lot more. huge list things here. Since
talked pain previous episode know lot people written
fibromyalgia. L carnitine shown reduce symptoms
fibromyalgia. Again, links studies examine.com, totally free site.
bulldog battering ram. nothing graceful bulldog.
decided wanted leave go get drink water. please forgive noise.
Okay. now turn another aspect gut-brain relationship will surprise
you, cases might shock you. really cool actionable
biology. gut microbiome, probiotics prebiotics. know today
talking emotions not pain remiss didn't mention another effect


acetylcarnitine reported can find listed link study
examine.com effect reducing symptoms migraine.
randomized controlled trial 133 participants frequent migraines.
taking 500 milligrams L-carnitine nothing 12 weeks. control little bit,
control experiment little bit tricky significant effect reducing
number migraine attacks per month. find really interesting

carry risks certain people, not others. again, find right


01:16:29 Gut-Microbiome: Myths, Truths & Tubes Within Us

think super interesting potential therapeutics various people.
deal gut microbiome gut brain axis. Today actually
talking lot already gut brain axis nothing
microbiomes. talking vagus nerve connects providing

oftentimes hear gut brain axis days, discussion
gut microbiome. again, situation incredible biology,
happy much discussion gut microbiome. somewhat
dismayed concerned hear either false partially
false. gonna clear misconceptions, first understanding

01:21:55 Probiotics, Brain Fog, Autism, Fermentation

will go far deeper gut microbiome gut brain axis. things
think might find surprising. First all, supporting healthy gut microbiome
good mood, great digestion great immune system function. However,
not mean maxing taking probiotic prebiotic can
possibly manage. mentioned many times believe probiotics, take
probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case
better. things like brain fog can come that, brain fog just
inability focus. People feel really not well generally. studies
little bit controversial think fair say people really increase amount
probiotic taking beyond certain amount start feeling foggy
mind. Now much? Well get probiotics mentioned Athletic
Greens, can get fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,
different sources around world. Actually, love hear
sources people know foods around world. fascinated
way different cultures arrived foods provide support
healthy microbiomes fermented. colleague Stanford, Justin
Sonnenberg, talked this. don't want quote
inappropriately, discussions it, published
ingestion fermented foods one best ways support healthy levels gut

different ways one that. people don't like fermented foods, however
people supplement it. isn't case better. know that.

comments. terrific. things can really
damage gut microbiome. huge misconception want
clear up. study published "Nature", among three
top journals science. know, "Nature", "Science"

01:25:20 Artificial Sweeteners & Gut Microbiome: NOT Bad; Depends!

"Cell" considered top tops, excellent journal showed artificial

Now enough chemical similarity saccharin ones
mentioned, not them. instance, Stevia, monk fruit distinct

negative effects gut microbiome, still tested. saccharin
really, shown study several studies can really negatively impact

people love keto works great them. ketogenic diet interesting
one shifts ketogenic diet shift gut microbiome.
people end feeling better. people end feeling worse. Likewise,
people go ingesting animal products including meat vegetarian
go vegan experience positive shifts mood affect. know
transition plant-based diet especially enrichment fiber
present diets also creates dramatic shifts gut microbiome. people
feel better that. people feel worse. course, gonna depend
whether not ingesting lot processed foods not. paper

sources non-animal sources processed foods tend create activity
within body surely roots nervous system lead over-

advice. note fasting. colleague Yale, expert

01:33:20 Fasting-Based Depletion Microbiome

gut microbiome. told something really interesting,
fast, actually digest certain components within dietary tract. actually depletes
good amount gut microbiome. interesting. good results
guess call intermittent kind circadian type fasting never
done long fast, push first meal hours first meal
generally around lunchtime longer periods fasting go day
two three days known deplete gut microbiome major ways. not
always necessarily bad thing replenished, often replenished
levels exceeded previous level. think GI tract even
mental effects returning eating feeding sometimes people don't
feel good start eating. really want food, start eating
again. don't feel good fast. may related
depletion microbiome occurs long fast. again, something
think talk doctor, idea fasting across board
good. may merits that, certainly cases,
deplete microbiome depletion microbiome significant
means return eating, actually not position digest
assimilate foods. foods not position impact
brain body way prior fast. is, think people
suggest kind gradual transition back consuming nutrients fast.
round up, want share results without question will impact

central theme studies tell about.

01:35:20 Mindset Effects Responses Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!



colleague Stanford, Alia Crum, done remarkable experiments
mindset. people think placebo effects belief effects,
actually go way beyond terms. number different
examples Aaliyah's lab coworkers demonstrated. two
particularly interesting Want share now really
emphasize beliefs can really impact way brain body work
together. think famous experiment two
groups individuals. given milkshake factors
measured blood IV ingested milkshake.
afterwards well. one factors looking something
called grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin peptide increases hunger.
longer haven't eaten grehlin goes up. know say, well, fast,
fast, fast eventually lose appetite. Well, grehlin still goes drops.
one people eats every three hours regularly, grehlin kind
gets little pulse get two hour 50 minute mark. little bit
timer well. really interesting peptide. event, gave
people milkshakes, two groups, one group got shake told low
calorie, healthy shake. got milkshake told
decadent high calorie shake. think something like two maybe even two
half times many calories other. Perhaps even more, don't recall details,
got high calorie low calorie condition. drank shake
measured grehlin subjects' blood. found
high calorie shake much robust effect blunting grehlin reducing
grehlin. interesting thing probably guessed already exact
shake given groups. people's belief content something
impacted physiology. speaks so-called top mechanisms
modulation physiology. previous episode pain talked
effects obsessive believe not, obsessive infatuation love pain
responses pain thresholds. yet another example beliefs subjective
feelings can impact physiology level periphery, grehlin released
periphery body. Now, beliefs affects extend beyond examples like
this, another good example like share Alia, Dr. Crum, colleagues
experiment took housekeepers, essentially hotel workers,


divide two groups. watch short film. one case, film
work important help people feel comfortable hotel, et

group told activity good showed lower blood
pressure. lost significant amount body fat reported enjoying
work far group. work, simply biased mentally
information given, physiology followed information.
not just placebo effect. incredible set findings illustrate
extent whether not believe food gonna good us not good
us. Well, can't escape reality. can't tell poison gonna
good ingest poison expect not kill you, can tell
eating 12 croissants, confess done it, long run, long time
ago can't tell necessarily going good
gonna make lose weight. belief effects not lying
cases, experiments notice subjects didn't prior knowledge
grehlin effects daily routine weight loss blood
pressure. order work naive information, right?
can't simply lie tell want believe
important, also important mind body fascinating
interplay. today talked mainly body things put
inside tube, runs mouth end rectum, basically
impacting cells, neurons, microbiota mucosal lining, heart, lungs
information feeding brain impact feel here.
also feel impacting body reacts levels core
physiology couldn't just tell gonna work,
believe certain substances, certain foods, certain nutrients profound

think might find surprising. First all, supporting healthy gut microbiome
good mood, great digestion great immune system function. However,
not mean maxing taking probiotic prebiotic can
possibly manage. mentioned many times believe probiotics, take
probiotics studies show take lots lots certain
probiotics like lactobacillus really ramp levels not case
better. things like brain fog can come that, brain fog just
inability focus. People feel really not well generally. studies
little bit controversial think fair say people really increase amount
probiotic taking beyond certain amount start feeling foggy
mind. Now much? Well get probiotics mentioned Athletic
Greens, can get fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,
